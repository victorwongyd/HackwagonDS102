I decided to apply for a loan in order to give myself some relief from very high interest rates on my credit cards.

I have a strict weekly budget for me to follow so I don&rsquo;t over spend myself. Unfortunately, even though I have been paying more than the minimum balance on my credit cards, a good 50-75% of my payments goes back in paying the interest charge. As for my job, I have a very stable position in the company I am working with. I have been working for them for more than 4.5 years. I am their only advertising employee. We have optical retail stores throughout the country and I handle all the web, newspaper, radio, and television markets.<br/><br/>I am a very responsible person.

Unfortunately now he is unable to pay his tuition for the upcoming semester and i also am unable to help him in my current economic state. I am a single mother that works as a maid in order to support him and my other son that is currently entering his first year of college.

I currently earn enough to meet my rent and other expenses but have been unable to come up with enough money to cover his tuition that is due in a couple of days.

I received a loan through lending club back in May to help with one part of my debt consolidation plan.  As I have moved forward some teaser rates have expired on my cards and interest rates are really bogging me down in trying to get ahead on the revolving debt.<br><br>I, like many others have had some big expenses (unforseen), and took advantage of some teaser rates to try and get ahead.  I did not accomplish what I set out to do.  So I am reaching out to the lending club community again.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to negotiate with the banks, but they really won't budge at this juncture.<br><br>My plan is to consolidate 2 cards 1 with $7,000 (approx) outstanding and 1 with about $5,500 outanding into 1 payment (Lending Club) whereby the monthly amount I am paying back will be less than the monthly revolving.<br><br>I have been employed for 6 years and have a steady job at BOA.  I also plan to use any tax returns, etc to help accelerate paying this and my other debts off early.<br><br>I have paid every lending club payment on-time and will continue to do so.  Again, I would much rather take out the middle man and have a fixed amount to pay with a fixed term (this ensures I do not fall into this trap again).  Also, I have cut up the cards and have reverted to a strict budget with a &quot;cash&quot; only philosophy.  <br><br>Thank You again for your time and consideration!<br> Borrower added on 11/26/11 > Additional information...I have a 1900 month mortgage (waiting for HARP 2 for a possible refinance), 400 a month car payment, plus the revolving and utilities.

812,388737,422393,15000.0,A,"Background on my financial debt:  $4,500 credit card debt, $7,000 bank line of credit; $4,500 Prosper loan; and $18,000 vehicle loan.  Interest rates on credit cards range from 15-18%, bank line of credit 12%, Prosper loan 10% and vehicle loan 18%.  Just received a generous credit card line from U.S. Bank.   I would move the $4,500 in credit debt to that card which guarantees a 3% rate on balance transfers for 5 years.   I would then use a Lending Club loan to pay of my current line of credit with the bank and pay down some of the vehicle loan.  And then because of the new zero balance on the bank line of credit the remainder of the vehicle loan could be transferred to that line of credit.  So the bottom line is I am transferring my credit card debt to a 3% rate, my current line of credit balance to an 8% rate and portions of my vehicle loan to 12% and 8% rates.  "

755,620600,795396,17000.0,B,"  Borrower added on 12/24/10 > I have been a teacher in the NYC public schools for 8 years. I am a newly wed, and my husband and I are starting to talk about raising a family. I am hesitant to do any such thing while owing so much money that never seems to decrease no matter how frugal I've become, or how many extra hours I work. <br/><br/>The loan from lending tree will save me approximately $7,000 on interest, it will set up a realistic monthly payment, and have an end date to it. I have never been late on a payment, since I was granted credit in college at 18 years of age.<br/><br/>My debt has come from a variety of pleasures had in my youth. I saw credit as a way to attain things that were unattainable. It started with a coat here and shirt there, then quickly moved up to a means for traveling. I have gone to Paris, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Alcapulco, Bermuda, 4 Cruises, Miami, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Ontario...and luckily I had the sense to stop once I moved out of my mom's apartment at 23.<br/><br/>I moved out of my two bedroom apartment, which I shared with my older brother, mother, baby brother, and grandmother. I could not bear to share a bedroom with my grandmother, after returning from a dorm at SUNY Stony Brook. So after 2 years back,  I went apartment hunting and furnished my apartment with everything a girl can dream of, with my $100,000 credit line from all the credit cards I had in my arsenal! Luckily I was smart enough not to cause irreparable damage (or was I?).<br/><br/>So here I am today in this mess of debt. Although I see a light at the end of the tunnel, I cannot imagine supporting a child when I am so stressed out about all the interest I am accumulating on top of what ever I owe. My youthful pleasures are keeping me from the adult experiences I should have had; such as a wedding, trips with my husband, and just overall sanity. I really want to get rid of this money I owe the right way, and continue to exhibit the integrity and self respect I was raised with.<br/>"

I pay my bills on time every month and have a very good credit score considering my age. My debt came from supporting myself through college for 4 and a half years. Even though I had a full time job most of my college experience, tuition, books and living were quite high at UT. I will have no problem making my monthly payments on this loan; it is very hard for me to watch the APR on my cards go up due to a bill in Texas that has gone into effect. My job current job is secure; I have only been my current job for about 8 months but was at my previous job for 3 years and needed a career change.<br/>"

640,62499,195929,22400.0,D,I'm in a similar position to many people. In this tight credit market I find it difficult to qualify for a traditional consolidation loan. I make a decent wage ($75K) and have a good DTI ratio. I have been in the USA for 10 years now and my credit history is not extensive enough according to most lenders. I also have 1 negative item on my credit file that is preventing me from qualifying for more traditional financing. I take great pride in paying all my debt obligations on time. Thanks in advance for your consideration.
