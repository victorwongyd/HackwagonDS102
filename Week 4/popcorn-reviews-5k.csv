5196_9#Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with and catered towards Rudy Ray Moores limitations as an actor. Its a fun movie thats more technically sound and acted. The performers dont take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in Dolemite. Highjly recommended.#1
2668_9#Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrances mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devils new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought. Rating 9/10#1
9565_3#I cant say that Wargames The Dead Code is the worst movie Ive ever seen, as it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say its the most transparent movie Ive ever seen. Not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10+ minutes in advance. There was no subtlety to anything the movie did, no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes. Every spoken or typed lines intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to  get into  the movie. I found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line, and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience, far more often than I found myself enjoying the movie.#0
10271_10#This movie should not be compared to  The Sting , or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. Its also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly, hugely recommended #1
5639_7#Ive read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it takes to get into music school), Britney Bashing, etc, etc. so lets focus on the movie and the message. This movie is a great family movie, but for a bloke watching by himself, get Hannibal.#1
2261_10#I saw this movie, and the play, and I have to add that this was the most touching story that I had ever seen. Until I saw this movie I was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults that were and are living in that era. It brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive, And to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing. This simply surpass a five star, I rate it a ten. Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that lays heavy in my heart.If there is a VHS, or DVD out there on the play, Please notify me ASAP.Thank You. PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance.#1
5553_4#This third Darkman was definitely better than the second one, but still far worse than the original movie. What made this one better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy had been changed and Durant was not brought back again. Furthermore there was actually some hint of character development when it came to the bad guys family and Darkman himself. This made my heart soften and I gave this flick as much as 4/10, i.e.   /     .#0
2728_3#Its nothing more than a weird coincidence that I decided to watch STARLIFT on the 59th anniversary of the day in June 1950 when President Trumans ordered US forces into the Korean War. STARLIFT, you see, is set largely at Travis Air Force base in California in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in Korea. But youd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name Korea mentioned. We see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but theres no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured. Which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute Americas men in uniform. Released in December 1951 by Warner Brothers, STARLIFT is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studios star-studded World War Two home-front morale booster  Hollywood Canteen.  This 1944 crowd-pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in LA hoping to get a date with Joan Leslie. But really it was just an excuse for Warners to trot out every star under contract, from Joan Crawford, John Garfield, and Barbara Stanwyck to Peter Lorre, Bette Davis, Sydney Greenstreet and more. STARLIFT features two Air Force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet Nell Wayne (a mask-like Janice Rule) and persuading a bunch of Warner Bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops. But in place of Crawford, Garfield et al the best the brothers Warner could scrape up in 1951 were Doris Day, Ruth Roman, Gordon MacRae, Virginia Mayo, Gene Nelson and Phil Harris with fleeting appearances by James Cagney, Randolph Scott, and a clearly embarrassed looking Gary Cooper. This threadbare cast, whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp, is perfectly matched by the crummy production values. Presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection. How bad is it? You can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage! To describe STARLIFT as a sloppy, lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy, lazy and third rate. Its just terrible. Avoid it.#0
3663_4#Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy stars in this, one of his weakest werewolf films but bear with me for a moment. Most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and there have been many home video versions of it over the years. If you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though, the most workable edition Ive seen of it goes by the title THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, and its an unedited and complete European version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from FURYs print. It is also letterboxed. The biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to Naschys claims) was often drunk, and the results are indeed rather incoherent. When watching THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copy, its not quite as difficult to make out whats going on, though the editing remains atrocious in spots. Worst of all is occasional non-matching footage of Naschys ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka  FRANKENSTEINS BLOODY TERROR ) and mixed into this one without any sensible reason! The wolfs clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again, as does his demeanor; one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from FURY, next he is growling and running around savagely from BLOODY TERROR. Really bizarre.#0
262_4#Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See Money Talks, Blue Streak). Okay I laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out ala Marlon Wayans portrayal in Requiem to a Dream. Or In Living Colors Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans moving performances in Spike Lees satire Bamboozled.#0
9197_7#This is actually a groovy-neat little flick, made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness . It takes a little while to warm up to it. The acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen-like charm. After a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries. The characters all develop a quirky charm, especially  Richard . Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy Id hire to play a raving psychopath. He just seems to enjoy it so very much! Mixed in with the scenes of mad-slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character,  The Midnight Skater  zooming through the campus in a black hoodie, looking for all the world like a cross between the Grim Reaper and, say, The Silver Surfer. These shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the Skater seem almost ominous. The soundtrack features some very fun Garage-Punk tunes and the raspy, raucous meanness of it meshes well with the films mood. Thumbs upish, I say.#1
11091_2#Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie. Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers. Granted, it does that so if you are looking for that  knock yourself out.#0
10531_10#I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I were browsing the local Hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film. We had no idea what it was going to be about, but it turned out spectacular. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the film was shot, and the actors were very funny. If you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think I highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so I wont. This movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies. Do you really think Nothing is bouncy?#1
8378_10#What a great film it is. The notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky. The ending is not just a fitting one, its more inspirational. #1
3085_1#Description Corny, utterly stupid and worthless. Its so cheap and lame, itll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget (Im guessing this) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I am giving you the best advice in the world With about 12 actors of your own, a few puppets you bought at a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, I gaurentee youll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap.#0
10831_7#An excellent cast makes this movie work; all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and its clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie. I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies, but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker films I cant help it imagine if The Commitments actually did make it big -- and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later.#1
3782_4#Heres the good news first.  Spirit  is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. The artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone. For all the incredible new animation technology on display in  Spirit , the story is almost  astonishingly  dull. There is a lesson here, and (needless to say) it doesnt just apply to animated movies. You can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we dont care about your characters, its bad film-making. Simple as that. The animation is still mind-blowing; I just cant wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it.#0
90_7#Yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work. I hope they all get addicted to drugs, pass-away their life and end up in jailso maybe we can see movies that dont all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.#1
3239_10#Why do I like DISORGANIZED CRIME so much? Why do I chuckle or laugh out loud any time I think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie? Its kind of hard to explain, but Ill give it a try. First of all, its very funny indeed - in contrast to what lots of  official  reviews want you to believe. But then again, that depends entirely on your sense of humour, so there is no sense in arguing about that. Often the humour is in the dialogue, and often it is situational comedy. There is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck. When the farmer drops them, they just stand there by the road, covered all over with cow s    or whatever. They are totally unnerved; then, realizing the humour of the scene, they one by one start laughing about themselves, and Ruben Blades (as Carlos), looking (and certainly smelling) terrible, nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath (simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again!). Which leads to the second point the acting. Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, Ruben Blades and Corbin Bernsen (okay, the latter overdoes it a bit at times) all fit and play their parts beautifully - in fact, you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film. Thirdly, there is the plot . Jim Kouf, the director and screenwriter, is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves. More often than not, there is no real action, and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss (Bernsen) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even-tually, grudgingly, like each other. The movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot - totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences, yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details. Incidentally, the title of the film is one of the best I have ever come across, because it per-fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way. Therefore, take my advice watch this film, but if you dont chuckle, grin or smile during the first 10 minutes, forget it - its not your type of film. PS. The only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how, do tell me.#1
155_3#This is not so much film as big budget childrens television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as Insomnia. When its first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, I thought  Wow! A nihilistic martial arts film!  but no such luck. Although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old mans long, white eyebrows. Zu Warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off. Thats not a good sign. I found the special effects to be somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena Warrior Princess. Primitive.#0
10160_7#I went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b-rated movie. I came out surprised and very amused. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had amazing comedic timing. The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between. The plot was enough to tie it all together, a woman (Eva) dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was-to-be husband, its sounds far-fetched but it actually works quite well.  7/10 - Overall its a worthwhile cinema watch, if not get it on DVD when it comes out.#1
5115_1#This had to be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen and Im 64 years old and a football fan. I went expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes into it, I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie (particularly the acting) could have gotten into a theater. About half way through, I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie. Although I was a little offended (and can see how some could be VERY offended if they were not Christian) at being preached to in a movie theater, it wasnt that big a deal. It was, however, a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of the acting. It is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater. Do I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I attend a movie? No. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not #0
531_10#This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. Ive seen this movie for the first time a week ago, since then every day I see the opening and every time I feel as thrilled as I felt the first time I heard David Niven uttering the immortal words from Sir Walter Raleighs The Pilgrimage Ive have already quoted Keats here, but Ill repeat his words A thing of beauty is a joy forever.#1
8410_3#This movie is all flash and no soul. The actors put a lot of passion into the numbers, but these numbers often didnt connect with the film and felt like stand-alone music videos. And no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you, every single one sounds like its coming from a studio, essentially sucking all the life from the songs. Off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized, especially Hudson, who essentially plays the same angry,  strong  (shes stubborn and selfish) black woman weve seen before. There was absolutely no depth to her character, nor any of the other female leads. Though I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudsons character faces hardship because of her weight, it is really her own refusal to do whats best for the team that lands her in trouble, making the end of the film totally meaningless. Hudsons Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she put forth emotion (though it was often misplaced, but this was the writer/directors fault), but when she was just acting, she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character. Eddie Murphys character is the only one with an arc, and he did a fine job, but still not Oscar worthy. The only actor who really brought something to the roll was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth into, no drama or heart, or even laughs. The placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one; the number when Hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long-winded if it had been any longer it could pass for a Family Guy skit. The movie has no idea what its about, and I felt insulted by the last few minutes. Its a big, boring waste of time, and really is the worst film I saw in 06, and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with.#0
11235_8#Nicely done, and along with  New voyages  its a great continuation! Fab to see James Cawley in the latest episode  Vigil  Check it out!  Viva les frontieres#1
1369_4#Amy Heckerlings second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930s gangster films made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keatons mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah thats right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keatons younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis OConnor his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keatons moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film. The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the  once  bit one time too many. Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties actual 1939 release date.  1/2 of 4 stars.#0
3449_2#Mercifully, theres no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering. The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer. All in all, this show stinks. The story is basically boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it  underrated  The critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so. Youll have to catch it on the last show, if you up late and having a bout of insomnia. But, if you can sit through it, youve more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends.#0
7847_9#Believe it or not, at 12 minutes, this film (for 1912) is a full-length film. Very, very few films were longer than that back then, but that is definitely NOT what sets this odd little film apart from the rest! No, whats different is that all the actors (with the exception of one frog) are bugsyes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked just like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so perhaps thats why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well--and a heck of a lot more realistically than King Kong 21 years later!  Weird but also very amazing and watchable.#1
11265_1#There have been some low moments in my life, when I have been bewildered and depressed. Sitting through Rancid Aluminium was one of these. Rancid Aluminium for sadists, wastrels, and regressives only who want to torture themselves.#0
718_10#Rock n Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so awesome was because of The Ramones! You couldnt have made the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, or The Clash in place of The Ramones, it just wouldnt have been the same. dey young, clint howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel, and the hall monters, just added to the movie. The whole entire movie is about The Ramonesespecially Joey! So everybody showed see Rock n Roll High School if your a huge fan of real PUNK. Not the sissy new crapbut the loud, and fast kind. The kind only The Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest In Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!#1
8061_2#May I start off by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much. I wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent. With this said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I cant. In all honesty, the only thing I think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it.#0
8495_8#Way, way back in the 1980s, long before NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities, the United States and Japan were at each others throat in the world manufacturing race.

5530_8#A must see for anyone who loves photography. stunning and breathtaking,leaves you in ore. seen it twice once in a cinema and now on DVD. it holds up well on DVD but on the big screen this was something else. But the star of this film is the cinematographers, how did they do what they did. amazing just amazing.#1
1090_1#this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever, i laughed so much my ribs began to ache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a manuscript by john Grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as the firm or the rainmaker.#0
11410_3#Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as GIDEON. This movie could have been a classic had Lambert performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. Too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life, the supporting performances by Charlton Heston, Carroll OConnor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excelent. 3 of 10.#0
2409_1#It was a painful experience, the whole story is actually there so I wont go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work, I thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesnt even tell him anything about itnot to mentioned bad acting very bad cant get any worst than that my advice dont watch and I thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently Uwi Bolls movies look like classical Shakespeare compared to this!#0
10931_7#Theres no romance or other side plot to this movie, its action and intrigue all the way, making it a real mans kung-fu movie. One movie you must watch if you are a kung-fu movie fan.#1
7527_4#There are so many stupid moments in Tower of Death Game of Death 2 that you really wonder if its a spoof. At times, it felt like I was watching a sequel to Kung Pow rather than a Bruce Lee film. Worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes, but so stupid sometimes that it hurts. If this was intended, then fine. Thumbs up, however, for recreating that projector room scene from Enter The Dragon.#0
6982_4#Damp telling of the American Revolution. Steven Berkoff appears as an enlisted American soldier.#0
7554_10#First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies. Second of all--you need to do this. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own fried flesh--thats only the beginning. The scenes and images, extraordinary on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re-watching. Furthermore, the DVD includes an amazing directors commentary, which, given the extremely spare dialog, only enhances the viewing. The commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes, but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of Cat Soup, along the lines of  well, the artists were asking what we should do in this scene, but I didnt know myself, so its hard to say why it turned out as it did  (thats a bad paraphrase by the way). Also, the sound throughout the film is very high quality, very precise, and very moody. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows Once youve watched it three times, however, youre not going to stop there#1
3075_1#Yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I have definately seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! It was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something (if you want to see crap, you should have of seen what some friends and I brought in). All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think was meant to bad like Mars Attacks. So I guess Im standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.#0
1859_3#Boy this movie had me fooled. I honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever, boy I got the cold shoulder that time. This movie was, and Im truthful, pretty damn good. It was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting. Some to the horrible acting and cliché killings were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. The killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more intriguing. The POV camera angles were awesome. This movie had such bad acting, with the exception of Christopher Allport, that is was funny. I will say that I am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror, but in fact a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot but it wasnt executed right. All in all I like the movie at first but now it is really annoying. But this movie is way better and darker than the sequel.#0
2873_1#This movie features a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petty. She has stunning green eyes, and is in the first few scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. She may not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers. The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It is not a good horror film, or a good fake journalistic report, or remotely well done. There is no skill apparent in its production. It is like a bad student film. The storys horrific elements do not make you sick, it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick. I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could.#0
9033_9#I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them. #1
12190_7#Its very hard to say just what was going on with  The Lady from Shanghai  and what the film could have been without studio interference. Orson Welles prime interest in film at this point was to raise money for his theater; indeed, funding his own projects is what drove him to seek out acting jobs. He made  Lady from Shanghai  for his soon to be ex-wife, Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn was fearful for Ritas image and held back the release of this movie for one year. Any film that Orson Welles directed is worth seeing, and  The Lady from Shanghai  is no exception. But this one leaves the viewer frustrated, as does  The Magnificent Ambersons  - as does any work that Welles did within the studio system. He was a great artist who should have been given a freer reign; he wasnt. He was a strange dichotomy - he needed more freedom, but as is evidenced by some of his later work, he needed the structure of the studio. Alas, he couldnt have both.#1
2696_3#I know John Singletons a smart guy coz he made Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and direct this? Its like the pilot of a bad  going away to college for the first time  teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition, I guess. Who wouldve guessed the date-rape victim would dump sausage for seafood? The angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of Neo-Nazis (and would be roomed-up with a black AND a Jew - just for laughs!) Even Laurence Fishburnes creepy reactionary history Professor just irritated me and I love the guy, its like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Big ups.#0
4635_7#Its difficult to not have a liking for Israeli director Eytan Fox and for his movies, which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems gay people can have in these regions. Besides he also gave voice to the young generations, and to the remarkable part of them, who really need PEACE and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the existences of people, both in Israel both in Palestine. These reasons, in my opinion, are sufficient to consider Fox a noteworthy director, even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control. However the fans of his movies (that he realized on team with Gal Uchovsky, his producer, co-screenwriter and also life companion) seem to not being vexed by this, since his new feature, THE BUBBLE (HA-BUAH), is having the same success of the previous YOSSI & JAGGER and WALK ON THE WATER. Announced as a contemporary gay version of  Romeo & Juliet , set in the present day Tel Aviv instead of Verona and with two men (one Israeli and the other Palestinian) at the place of the two Shakespearean young lovers, the film actually is quite different from that or, better, its also something else. In fact the bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man, Noam, played by the Fox regular Ohad Knoller (Yossi in YOSSI & JAGGER, but I must confess I miss Jagger, the astonishing Yehuda Levi!) and his two co-tenants, a guy and a girl, chose to live. Around thirty-years-old, restless, witty and firm (despite the protagonist just spent a period as national service in a checkpoint on the frontier with the Palestine) to live a life that wont be only made of war. The two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they brotherly love and support each other. Their lives are destined to change when Noam falls in love with Ashraf (the TV star Yousef Joe Sweid) a young Palestinian who came to live in Tel Aviv. The laws so far in force among the group are neglected, but not the will to aid one friend. Still it wont be easy for Noam and his friends, cause Ashraf is clandestine in Israel and in the meantime his family, who lives in Palestine and doesnt know hes gay, is looking forward to settle his wedding with a very beautiful girl, who is a relative of Ashrafs beloved sister bridegroom-to-be, who he is also a terrorist and he will have a strong liability in the development of the plot, with consequences not just for the two men. Because the prejudices against the homosexuality and the peace (interesting dualism, if not automatic) are stubborn and so the tragedy is unavoidable. Even if the film focus on the obstacles the relationship between Noam and Ashraf meets with, it doesnt the overlook the other characters, which turn out well written (for example Golan, the boyfriend of Yelli, Noams fellow tenant, introduced as a lively boor, and then disclosed as a sweeter and more open minded person) and aptly performed (besides the two leads, we mustnt disregard the funny Zohar Liba and the lovely Daniela Virtzer, the girl of the gang; moreover LATE MARRIAGEs star Lior Ashkenazi appears as himself in a cameo). It also melds the gloomy tones with the more brilliant ones, even if the director cant do without a melodramatic conclusion. I watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime I often thought about it, proof that Fox and his pal have a knack to strike home.#1
3144_10#This is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television. Season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons. The only reason that I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the finale. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to peoples imaginations, often depicting the characters in famous TV shows or movies from the 70s. It is a rare show in that i liked every character (with the exception of the final seasontoo late to try to develop a new character and fez wasnt nearly as funny). Reds foot in your ass comments never got old, nor did Kelsos stupidity. Bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long, too long even.#1
11542_7#The first time I saw this, I didnt laugh too much. At the time, I was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time. I had the same reaction when I viewed it a second time a few months ago, and this time, it was because Felixs aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit. This scene made some of the things Oscar said and did to Felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel, and their personality clashes werent as amusing as they could have been. Had I not already known the story, I would have been worried that some of Oscars antics to Felix might push him over the edge. As it was, it didnt make me laugh or smile like the television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall did. Still, all in all, a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10.#1
5715_2#Say Yes is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, but it never does. Its the kind of motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers.  Overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy The Hitcher and Spoorloos, but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved.#0
6266_8#This picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of Alien Invaders taking over a town and many of its men folk. 8/10.#1
7450_3#I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.#0
2531_4#The title song for this movie ..is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  the one thing that is depicted in this movie that I honestly can not remember is .I never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being. I remember that era very well, and I dont young men going around wishing they had a van. Instead I remember young men in the 70s (self included) wanting a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or a hot rod Ford Mustang, but never a van. This movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one(which just wasnt true of that era)#0
7763_3#My giving this a score of 3 is NOT what I would give the original Soviet version of this film. It seems that American-International (a studio that specialized in ultra-low-budget fare in the 60s) bought this film and utterly destroyed it--slicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film! Plus, much of this 64 minutes was new material (such as the  monsters )--so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original. The original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the Soviet conquest of space--though I really am not sure what it was originally! For insight into the original film, read Steven Nylands review--it was very helpful. The bottom line is that the film was butchered--turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art (for the time) being turned into a grade-C movie. Because of this, the Soviets really had a reason to hate America! Im just shocked that the horrible job A-I did with this film didnt convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks! Its worth a look for a laugh, but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between. So, the film is a dud--not bad enough to make it a must-see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously. I would really love to see this movie in its original form--it must have been some picture.#0
1531_1#This film is so bad, it made me want to vomit. Poorly produced, a complete laugh free zone. Why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof (and a damn funny one at that) as it stands? The sets are laughable, the effects so bad that they arent even laughable, and the acting farcical. It is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage. National Lampoon once made Animal House, which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious. Now theyve been relegated to making TV movies like this lump of     . Name your expletive, and it could be accurately used to describe this film.#0
7096_1#It is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling. The costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful. In an odd way I actually enjoyed this film, once I had accepted that it wasnt going to be any good. It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!), but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights, that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. Lets just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and David Thewlis haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!#0
1186_8#A lot of talk has been made about  psychological Westerns , but this is one of the very few that is truly in that genre. It has big name stars who perform very well, but it is the director who makes this such a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his British safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the upstart (in contrast to the usual young upstart, Taylors character is middle aged, too), who wants to slaughter buffalo, and lures Granger into business with him. They hire two other big name actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, into being their skinners. Granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed, knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct, knowing if they become extinct, the Native American way of life will greatly suffer. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic saidism, unlike the one dimensional sadists of modern film, created by nerds and dorks. He is insecure, and needs human companionship. Still, he wont stop at murder. The end pits the two against each other, with a startling conclusion. The psychological effects of what theyre doing are well depicted.#1
11215_10#I first watched the Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 years old and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they must have anyway because since watching the movies, I have tried to learn as much about the real Sheriff Buford Pusser as I can. All 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a true hero, I only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him. I would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart goes out to them. So from a 30 year old fan of Sheriff Pusser and of the 3-part Walking Tall movies and the actors that portrayed him, please do not be negative about these movies and actors, they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And to all the young people who may have not heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.#1
1638_8#Heartland was in production about the same time as Michael Ciminos Heavens Gate - Heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film. Its sad that Hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys (based on a directors single big hit) and neglect such a wonderful story.#1
773_7#i expected something differentmore passion,dramaAgain another failed attempt of originality.im sorry to say that the film falls into the old cliché of cheesiness.15 year old teens may appreciate it though.The acting was not very convincing and the lines common,lacking any wit.Still, the soundtrack was good and well adapted.I cant say that this movie is a total flop,because people do watch it but it didnt meet the publics expectations and sunk into mediocrity.So,to conclude,the production keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half,which is an appreciable thing.Thus,I guess its worth seeing if you dont get annoyed#1
10160_4#A typical Lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify Lanzas MGM contract at the time. As reported by member Lastliberal (above) Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off (and sometimes on) camera. In addition, his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable. After doing their second (and last) film together,  Toast of New Orleans , the normally quiet Grayson stormed into Louie B. Mayers office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with Lanza again  period. Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM then Lanza, so Graysons statement stuck. Grayson went on to star in a number of widely received (and far more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in life when asked to compare Lanza and Keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them, and that Keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the  real people  in the audiences.#0
3922_10#Carmen is one of the best films Ive ever seen. Its hard to say whose performance is best Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are superb.They dance their souls out. Its a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth; myth penetrates everyday life. Dance becomes life and entire life is danced out. Real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else, act out the parts of lovers of old. The magic is continuing.#1
5512_7#The first one meant victory. This one means defeat. It takes place in a Bolivia, there the guerillas are sick and wary and dont meet that much sympathy from the farmers. If you know your 60s history, you understand how it ends. You will understand it even without that knowledge. The documentary feeling is there around the icon, which is one of the greatest achievements in this big Soderbergh project. He has succeeded.#1
8_4#6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting. Dont waste your time with this film, its not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens  storywise , not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). Its always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but theres too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics#0

10126_2#Granting the budget and time constraints of serial production, BATMAN AND ROBIN nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any  cliffhanger  list, utterly lacking the style, imagination, and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor, BATMAN.

9256_1#Pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other. Thats it. For about 5 minutes we see this. Its shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music. It LOOKS interesting but theres no plot and really--the violence inherent in this got disturbing. Also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant garde material might like this but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (ocassionally) disturbing. Really--what is the point in all this? I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence. I really wish I could go lower than 1.#0
369_10#Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I have seen it at least a hundred times and I cant go through it without crying. I defy anyone to watch the reunion of Celie and Nettie, or Shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty. Whoopie Goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal. And for the person who said you cant love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! Im a testament to that.#1
6478_10#Despite being told from a British perspective this is the best WW II documentary ever produced. Presented in digestible (as digestible as war can be) episodes as the grave voice of Laurence Olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time. Eagerly awaiting its appearance on DVD in the U.S. The Europeans had their opportunity with a release in DVD earlier this year.#1
7320_4#A bondage, humiliation, S&M show, and not much else. The plot is flat, really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved set-pieces. The host of the aforementioned show, a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses, was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing. The dream-like ending felt tacked on. To the films credit though, Aya Sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead. Flower and Snake has been compared with Eyes Wide Shut but aside from some minor surface similarities, Kubricks is easily the more layered, artistic, and atmospheric picture.#0
7464_3#I did not watch the entire movie. I could not watch the entire movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case. If Chris had not played such an alien character (who never really connects with the other characters in the movie) and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable (except for trying to draw laughs) and the comedy scenes werent so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed far too familiar) this movie could have been watchable. But it isnt. Dont watch it.#0
5140_4#Demer Daves,is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and  broken arrow  remains in everybodys mind.As far as melodrama is concerned,he should leave that to knowing people like Vincente Minelli,George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie.Natalie Wood s character was inspired by Fannie Hursts  imitation of life  (see Stahl and Sirk),but who could believe shes a black mans daughter anyway?Susan Kohner was more credible in  imitation of life )and Sinatra and Curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with themthe poor officer,and the wealthy good-looking -and mean- sergeant.Guess whom will Natalie fall in love with?France is shown as a land of tolerance ,where interracial unions are warmly welcome.At the time(circa 1944) it was dubious,it still is for narrow-minded people you can find here there and everywhere.#0

2430_10#This a Casper the Friendly Ghost short from my childhood, and I re-watch it on YouTube (Thank GOD! for You Tube); after that I love this short, and it is one of my favorite Casper shorts.

3671_4#Dull, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance (Weller) who goes on across the country just to find his ex-wife and children; meanwhile, he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands. In his dangerous track, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better. The final result is just a movie without suspense or gritting moments. Even the good cast is completely waste. I give this a 4 (four).#0
7103_1#That is the best way I can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husbands first wife who died under mysterious circumstances. That sounds well and good, but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom. In fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin. Well trust me, no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls, peacocks, weird gardeners, and doors being knocked on. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader. And you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking. Someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate. Yes in the end this is a slow paced (which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour), boring little tale, that is easily figured out by the average person. Apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person.#0
3106_1#Whenever I make up a list of the absolute worst movies Ive ever seen, this movie is always on it. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It took an act of will to sit through the whole thing, and I would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again. In short if youre feeling too happy, give this movie a whirl; otherwise, dont say I didnt warn you.#0

Usually I will go for stupid if its funny, but this stupid was so stupid it almost (or possibly did) make me stupid. The twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway. Please dont let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie. (Woah, my nose just grew eight inches.)#0
6522_10#During the whole Pirates of The Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this Anthony Quinn directed Cecil B. DeMille supervised movie and getting it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana which would have helped make The Crescent City once again famous for its Pirate Connections. When the Execs at Paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then I will be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now !#1
6747_8#Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) opens, appropriately, with Dana Andrews and Gene Tierneys names inscribed on the sidewalk, as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate. The sidewalk represents respectability, integrity and morality  only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter. But even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion, and, when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end, sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting ones shoes wet. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) was born in the gutter, his father a professional criminal, and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk, perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb. As a police detective, Dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked, but he possesses a mean-streak that he cant escape. When his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead, Dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised, a cheap criminal wholl cheat and lie to cover up his offence. The tension, as Dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime, is absolutely riveting  certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era  though I feel that the situation still wasnt exploited to its full potential. The taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified Dixon as the perpetrator, but Preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes Dixon on the stairs. Had the witness been brought in as Dixon was re-enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance, we could have had some genuine fireworks. And why, for that matter, couldnt the taxi drivers testimony have immediately absolved Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully) from suspicion of murder? Niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from Ben Hecht, who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard-hitting cops and wise-cracking felons. Andrews seething and implosive law-enforcer, tormented by rage and remorse, has rarely been done better, at least the equal of Robert Ryan in Nicholas Rays On Dangerous Ground (1952).#1
12461_1#Contrary to most other comments about  Syriana  on the IMDb web-site, I and my family found watching this film on DVD at home a complete waste of time and space. This is one DVD that this family will not be sitting through again.#0
6197_1#At the end of the film I just asked myself  is it the worse movie I have ever seen or is it the worse movie I have ever seen ? . And the answer is Actually, after having seen this movie and thought a bit about the meaning of it, you just cant find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes, which are unbelievably brutal and useless. It seems to me as if the director tried to push this question into the crowds head   what are such crimes compared to horror of war and extermination ?  because i noticed that the two awful scenes where directly connected to war and its horrors (during the first scene you can here the girl that is being raped screaming and in the same time you hear one of president Bushs speeches about the necessity of starting a war with Iraq and in the second scene, the pictures of the three criminals sticking a sword in a womans vagina, are directly followed by archive pictures of World war II. But as a matter of facts, i really could not think about the relative gravity of theses two different kinds of human horrors expression, being done i was too shocked by what i had just seen and felt. (sorry for bad English)#0
5586_4#Man To Man tries hard to be a good movie it has its heart at the right place, it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate. But there lies also some of the problems of this picture. It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - Man To Man doesnt let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role he does his best to look concerned, genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer. Add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it it is entertaining, has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch) but youll be leaving the theatre satisfied. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious) and succeeds most of the time.#0
6051_9#This is a great British film. A cleverly observed script with many quotable lines, which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend. As per usual Phil Daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and Gary Stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, i think it will find an audience outside of this, purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t-shirt. also A great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This really could be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies. Like the weed in the Welsh fields its a grower!#1
6262_9#This was incredible, meaning that it was hard to believe, that the  forgotten tribe  would make this astounding migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didnt stage some of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness. I had the pleasure of seeing this and  Kon Tiki  on the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.#1
5217_4#Meet Peter Houseman, rock star genetic professor at Virgina University. When hes not ballin on the court hes blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures. Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal. Id want to be immortal too if I looked like Christian Bale and got the sweet female lovin that only VU can offer. An assortment of old and ugly university professors dont care for the popular Houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results. This causes Peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum. Much to my amazement there are side effects and he, get this, metamorphoses! into something that is embedded into our genetic DNA that has been repressed for  millions of years . He also beds Dr. Mikes crush Sally after a whole day of knowing her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He is an angry little boy. Metamorphosis isnt a terrible movie, just not a well produced one. The whole time I watched this I couldnt get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989. The look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest. It does not help that its packaged along with 1970s movies as Metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainments 50 chilling classics. There is basically no film quality difference whatsoever. The final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually, for me at least, save the movie from a lower rating. Pay attention to the computer terminology such as  cromosonic anomaly . No wonder Peters experiment failed. Your computer cant spell! This is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern.#0
1636_1#This movie will be a hit with those that enjoy sophomoronic, mindless, explicit bragging about sexual exploits and F in almost every sentence. Like a good plot? Like comedy?

When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it and I thought that had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately, it didnt. To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. By doing this you wont waste 90 minutes of your life, as I did.#0
11095_7#Ive always liked this John Frankenheimer film. Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasnt just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case that its the last good film Roy Scheider made. Ive always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and hes excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. A classic exploitive thriller that shouldnt be forgotten.#1
8145_1#This film is so bad I cant believe it was actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you insane? Did we really watch the same movie? Or the same sh   should I say. Everything is bad in this film. The story (is there a story?) is going nowhere, completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogs are simply just ridiculous), the music score (what the      is that?), the editing, and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. Reminds me the old Macist movies To give you an example of the amateurism of the production, the mermaids costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it. Im not joking, thats exactly what it is. A big, huge, waste of money. Useless.#0
6104_1# Fungicide  is quite possibly the most incompetent, embarrassing, pitiful  film  I have ever seen. The acting is criminal, the direction practically non-existent, and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer. I also think its wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto IMDb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the  movie.   Fungicide  is an absolute travesty of film-making. Mr Wascavage is either very, very stupid or very, very cynical.#0
9817_8#I remember this movie. Quite intense for an 11 year old. Good editing, I felt terrible for the St. Bernard. Id watch it again if it were rebroadcast, but the signal is passing Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I am just glad I didnt live in THAT neighborhood. Oh those 70s. What a decade. If they remade it I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not made in Lodi NJ. The shot with the St Bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the filmand then they left the carcass on the stoop. Rotten kids.#1
6401_1#Can I Do it till I Need Glasses? at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The folks who unleashed this wretched pile of spewing vomit upon the world, lack any semblance of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience must consist of the recently labotimized, and infants who play with their own feces. Anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a snicker out of this film. It consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious. It ends at the ludicrous. The jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell (usually potty or sexually related) where they dont know the meaning of all of the terms they use. You know, like the one about daddys car and mommys garage. To apply any sterner method of criticism would be pointless, since the usual standards of acting, writing, direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative  minds.  behind this mess. Not to be judgemental, but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth. #0
2396_7#This is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a NY production of Macbeth. Although it has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of Macbeth) in our modern world, the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously. Recognizable actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the  murder  of Banquo (John Elsen) is rehearsed. Probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this film.#1
9863_10#I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a woman of 30, with no children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I have seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous, and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasionsyes,still). My favourite scene is the part where Sid says  Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!  and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the  tigers  Pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish  or however that part goes! That is THE funniest part about the whole movie, although I also really enjoyed the humour behind  putting sloths on the map  and many other parts as well. The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is  Brother Bear .#1
314_10#This show is a great history story. Its has everything from slavery,the way they were treated, religion, the ways Jews were sent into hiding,the inquisition, the belief in the Orisha the African gods, the way women were treated,including the daughters. Even down to homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined and that Violante, that character saddens me. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her.I am so glad they decided to re-release it to t.v. again. Although I would love to see the unedited version. Xica has become my Heroine. I look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it. I love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century. I look forward to my Xica every night. It would be great to dub it in English so the Americans can love her too.#1
9626_2#Make no bones about it. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. Its clichéd the whole way, not very funny, predictable, and illogical. Lets start at the beginning characters. Theres the boring, luckless guy - giving Stiller another notch in his boring, luckless guy belt - the allegedly wild, but in reality just fairly normal, love interest - whom Aniston plays well, but really needed no effort to do so - the fat, jovial friend, and then the assortment of clichés an annoying daredevil Australian guy, a confident Spanish guy, etc. The storyline the beginning is slightly unusual, but thereafter goes into the standard any-movie style, with every plot turn as predictable as your average knock-knock joke. The biggest problem was that Stillers characters  development  really seemed to come from nothing - like your average school play, the writers knew where he started and where he ended, but didnt put enough stock into properly telling the middle bit. Finally, the alleged jokes were nothing but highly watered down versions of standard gross-out humour; there was a regulation chunder scene, sweaty fat men, etc. Final comment This film may have been dreadful, but Aniston still picked a better between-Friends-seasons movie than Kudrows odious Marci X. #0
9312_1#Worst movie on earth. I dont even know where to begin but I hope I can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex. The actors are some of the worst Ive ever seen, and couldnt have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie. The movie must have had a record breaking low budget which Im sure was wasted almost solely on the movies cover. This movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies. I would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment I put us through. Dont see this movie!#0
1763_1#This is one of the worst movies ever made. Trite. Predictable. Flat. You could send it to politicians you dislike, in laws, ex-wives, Teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., and a host of others.#0
1320_1#This movie was exactly what I expected it to be when i first read the casting. I probably could have written a more exciting plot, its a pity that they left it to a pack of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank God (and we too) that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living. He cant play, he cant talk, he cant even move very good on mainland without his skis Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl, and thats all. She obviously wasnt chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs. Nevertheless I must admit that she could be the Tombas acting teacher, because hes even a worse actor than her, and thats funny, especially considering that she isnt italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.#0
4214_10#The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies that Ive seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this film), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best film noirs. It represents Fuller at his most controlled. I like him when hes out of control, of course, but nearly everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back. She finds him through a stool pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters loyalties (that, and the fact that she learns shes working for communists; the Cold War stuff is really interesting). The love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable, but its not so bad that it harms the film (unlike Fullers previous film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This must be one of his best roles, but Im not so familiar with his career that I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema. I will never forget that. 10/10.#1
3542_8#Had I been familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before seeing the movie, I might not be as fond of it as I am. Although in all fairness, I would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is quite the actor as well, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.) The important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so.#1
5866_9#Jacknife is a war movie that is just about as far removed from the war as war movies get. It can hardly be classified as a war film, because the only way that any war has an effect on the story or the characters is in their memories of it, and even these we are hardly ever shown. It poses very interesting questions about life, especially in the way that the movies tagline says that only one of them is really alive (and by the way, even though the tagline refers only to Dave (Ed Harris) and Megs (Robert DeNiro), it is talking about all three of the characters in the film). Dave and Megs were friends in the Vietnam war, and Megs has returned to take Dave out on a fishing trip that they have been planning for a lot longer than you might have guessed.  At times this is a slow moving drama, but Jacknife is entertaining along the way and has a huge payoff at the end, which amazingly manages to be sappy without being cheesy. There is an almost excess of emotion at the end of the film that scarcely fits with the rest of the movie, but it is so good that it doesnt dumb down anything that the movie has accomplished up to that point. Everyone involved gives a wonderful performance, and it is one of those rare films that just about makes you want to stand up and shake your fists victoriously in the air.#1
4770_2#I wanted to like this film, yes its a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films. If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film.unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing.but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.. I will end with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!#0

11125_10#What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude?  The Sopranos  has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting. Watching this show youll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people dont watch the show because its violent, its not all about the violence, its about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see. For me, I dont like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia. For me, its a show about family. A family who, through generations, happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence, and dares to be different.#1
10517_8#Lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of Jane Austens satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th Century England. Northam and Paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material (which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism). I liked the look of the film and how shots were set up, and I thought it didnt rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do. Very good results.#1
47_2#When a man who doesnt have Alzheimers cant remember how many films hes made, he probably is the worlds most prolific director after all. That man is Jesus Franco, the king of so-called eurotrash. His 1980 flick Devil Hunter is as rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the films title is misleading, for starters) as any other Franco film Ive seen. That makes it sound pretty awful, and it is Yet Franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility, a generous way with the baldly outrageous, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made. The mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out, even while youre mostly waiting for them to end because theyre so very tedious. Ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot. If youre trying to see all the Video Nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and youll be made as restless as I was. If you like Franco, youll watch this anyway. If you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are youll never come across this film. Copies of it arent just lying around, and I could hardly recommend the seeking out of it. Its Franco. Lazy, crazy Franco.#0
408_10#I cant tell you all how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say that this move is  too confusing  or  like swimming in drying concrete . I say that these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons this movie is for you, (especially if you got into the Oriental Adventures) Im just sorry that I did not get to see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get my own big screen t.v. -)#1
71_10#I couldnt believe the comments made about the movie. Busy Philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and I hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her! You Go Girl!#1
3991_4#Im not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks. The abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame. Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes, play as if some college kid wrote this. I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes. The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about. The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in. This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation. I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. He should stick to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls. Shock movies do not an Oscar make.#0
11585_1#What happened? Those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen. Nightmare on Elm St. had gone noticeably downhill after its cult-classic of a first film, but I doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration. Nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film, and nobody is more distraught about it than I am. I know this has mostly been a rant about why Freddy sucks now, but this movie is overall, horrible, and one of the worst movies ever made. Not recommended to anyone, and even ANOES completionists wont want to see this one again.#0
4278_10#This is the movie Ive seen more times than any other (I believe I saw it on average once every year since it was released). And every time I see it, it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex Yu cinematography. This movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover. In the same league Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection.#1
12152_2#Some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies, despite the government controlling the media. The makings of the film dont understand that the George Romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films ( Land of the Dead  withstanding). This satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario. Whats subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction? Anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter-cut with the film? Nope. Furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible, the characters thoroughly unlikable, and the plot inane. Add this all up and you have the worst, most incompetent zombie film since,  C.H.U.D. 2  reared its hideous head. My Grade D#0

4010_2#When I first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the stereotypical  mysterious  vampire and Sookie presented herself as an independent woman. However, the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box. Minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile.#0
7695_2#I was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights. Instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning, even though i tried watching it twice   OK, so Son of the Dragon has many possible fans out there, but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wont get it. If you just want the kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the 3 ninjas.#0
4757_8#Rod Serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development. There are no such shows now, but rather  Housewife  sluts ala Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens. Rex Lewis Field#1
5521_8#Following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the mans legacy is exactly as such. In direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to Chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. The change of setting isnt just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. Yet, as Che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, Part Two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of Ches life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner. - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http www.invocus.net)#1
7513_3#What can I say? I think I have to write  Spoiler alert  and then  reveal  they used the F-word a LOT in this movie - like in every two sentences. I did not like this movie at all - too much hints on sexual perversions, sidesteps and cheating. And that swearing was totally out the window. I gave this movie  3  and two of those points are for Mira Sorvinos sexy movements on the dance floor.#0
6324_8#These guys are anything but the Usual Suspects! They are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it,but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that.No one is better than William H Macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck.This is probably his best performance since Fargo.Sam Rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection,and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also.Luis Guzman brought some great comic relief as Cosimo,and George Clooney stole every scene in his cameo role.The heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious. The direction was also spot on by the Russo brothers.There was certainly a Coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers.They have a long way to go to match the Coens but this is an excellent start and I look forward to their next celluloid outing. .

8268_1#This movie is horrible. Everything in it has been done before. There is nothing original. I cannot stand when writers dont come up with their own plots. I hate this movie.#0
11772_1#I will be shortThis film is an embarrassment to everyone except its cinematographer. The very fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are  treated  to a lingering dance scene. The plot is ridiculous no one except the most ardent fan of BAD horror will get anything out of it. And for the love of God please stop saying this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female empowerment because it is quite clearly not (childish fumbling lesbians, what the hell?). this was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival (that i saw anyway), someone even collapsed halfway through the film probably because they couldnt take any more of it. this may seem like an overly critical rant but i genuinely cannot find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy. In short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class A drugs.#0
12132_10#Enjoyable in spite of Leslie Howards performance. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat, uninteresting character. One is supposed to feel sorry for this man; however, I find myself cheering Bette Davis Mildred. Ms. Davis gives one her finest performances (she received an Academy Award nomination). Thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life.   Be sure not to miss when Mildred tells Philip exactly how she feels about him.#1
3410_9#I discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it. It is not a strictly biographical film; it is  loosely based  on the facts. But I found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness, and Michel Serrault gives an unforgettable performance as Dr. Petiot. But it does remind us of the duality of evil people; Petiot is a robber and a murderer, but he is also a devoted father and husband. Just as we learned that Hitler loved dogs, and that Nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men, so we have to recognize that Petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally. His insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in Paris; when killing, robbing and disappearing are happening all around, nobody pays attention as Petiot tosses more corpses on the pile.#1
162_8#For a  no budget  movie this thing rocks. I dont know if Americas gonna like it, but we were laughing all the way through. Some really Funny Funny stuff. Really non-Hollywood. Ive seen some of the actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them I think Ive seen in commercials or in something somewhere. Basically it Rocked! Luckily I got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors.#1
8601_1#Ok, where do we start with this little gem? Mutant slugs begin to take over a small New England (?) town. Only one man can stop them and that man is Mike Brady! Now, if that wasnt laughable enough, stay tuned. As for horror? This film is not to be taken seriously. There isnt horror! Theyre slugs for crying out loud. The entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two. Only watch this film in a MST3K type environment, otherwise I can see some major damage to the brain.#0
3181_10#I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, in which it won an award for Best Picture. This film is brilliantly done, with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble. My favorite performances were from Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane , and Adam Jones. Also, there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, that I was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget. The writer-director Adam Jones, who I believe also won an award for his writing, does an excellent job with direction. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie. Definitely a must see.#1
4617_10#Ive been a Jennifer Connelly fan since Phenomena, and after I heard about seven minutes in heaven, I saw it as soon as I could. The movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal I loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie #1
3788_3#There is a lot to like here. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. However, for that reason the film does not ring true. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leos brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family or what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it only hints at both. While this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers.#0
8101_1#Its frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, not only the movie is not  as good  as the book, but is an insult to the book. Id rather see Milan Kunderas novel turned on fire than into this  something,  which the director probably calls  adaptation.  All the beautiful philosophy that asks  is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?  is put aside, and instead, all the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis (I cannot say Tomas) sexual adventures with his dumb wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. François Truffaut already said it bad directors make bad movies. Dont waste your time and money. Read the book instead, its really worth it.#0
11943_7#I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldnt help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allens work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoops most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johansons character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen. Needless to say if you enjoy Allens work watch it. If not watch something else#1

5392_10#The Waiting Womans Ward of a large lying-in hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where LIFE BEGINS. There are a few absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are obviously much too old; Farrell becomes blatantly drunk in the Ward but none of the staff seem to notice; an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will - but this really only enhances the quirky entertainment value of the film and keeps things from becoming too serious.#1
7625_10#Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis in show-business, so many things were false in this film. First of all, the makers claimed Elvis opened his famous live shows in 69 after a 9 year hault for films by wearing a white jump-suit made in 1972. Also they claimed he sang burning love which he first sung in 1972 and the wonder of you which he first recorded in 1970. They also claim that he got his first guitar for christmas when all Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. I know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.#1

Of course wed seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on, but that never gives the background and specific teams. In conclusion, to Simon Pavey - you sir are a hero, I was so impressed by the your quiet achiever manner and the fact that you actually finished..just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is. And to Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - full marks for pulling it off. To think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable. Youre all wonderful.#1

The only way Diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. However the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diazs hand in front of her instead of behind? Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop.#0
5082_1#Its very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies. They get worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) is a depressing stab at the camera. Its unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in Romania , the worst of them get to be sent abroad ( e.g. Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without a plot , acting or script is a waste of time and money. Score 0.02 out of 10.#0
8639_9#I have to start off by apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this film was hilarious. Its mostly because of Brad Pitts performance. Spot on. Overall I gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. Underrated.#1
422_1#A lot of death happens in the wild. You dont need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out! But does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this fascination with gruesome death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film!  If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review, why not focus on Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socializing; playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, like mouth brooding; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty, and why not be much more well-rounded - and focus on delight and inspiration, instead?#0
5490_1#When I was a kid we always used to be babysat, and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema. This is one of the films we watched. This is one of the stupidest films Ive ever seen, I think it might even be a Walt Disney Pictures film! A martian is dropped on earth, turns into a human, befriends a human, and is trying everything he can to get back home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors, Back to the Futures Christopher Lloyd as the martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumbers Jeff Daniels as Tim OHara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But apart from that its complete crap. Poor!#0
9038_8#I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly. Ive seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself.#1
5438_3#I am quite a fan of novelist/screenwriter Michael Chabon. His novel  Wonder Boys  became a fantastic movie by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  won the Pulitzer Prize a few years back, and he had a hand in the script of  Spider Man 2 , arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time. The title  The Mysteries of Pittsburgh  must refer to the characters themselves, because thats what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional stand-ins for actual people. The film never lets us in. We never know what makes any of them tick. We see them do lots of things, but we dont know why. And the absence of  why  is one of the worst things a movie can have.#0
5346_3#I had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations. In fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times. Unlike other Meyer films, the sexual antics are down to a minimum. Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful. Because it so bad in so many ways, it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste. Perhaps, because it is so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable.#0
10373_3#This is one of those films that I could only sit through once. Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie just clumped along with no cohesion. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing. What a pity! Its such a great book. I would recommend Disneys 1951 version.#0
4327_4#Some amusing humor, some that falls flat, some decent acting, some that is quite atrocious. This movie is simply hit and miss, guaranteed to amuse 12 year old boys more than any other niche. The child actors in the movie are just unfunny. When you are making a family comedy, that does tend to be a problem. Beverly DAngelo rises above the material to give a funny, and dare I say it, human performance in the midst of this mediocrity.#0
6408_2#The films of UPA are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light-years behind that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at their prime. Sadly, due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame-rates and lovely backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted about 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, the films were dirt cheap to make and theyd received several Oscars to  prove  that the cartoons were now mainstream. So as a result, lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasnt reversed until the 1980s. As for the story, its a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some will love this, others will just find it very, very loud. Its the traditional  Frankie and Johnny  story and because of the shootings and all, its probably not a great film for the kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, its not a particularly good film for me, either! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank (which I am, to a degree). However, I love animated films and a little of this minimalistic UPA style goes a very, very long way and you cant seriously consider them great works of art--just very, very quickly made cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something--anything else #0
7856_10#Mary Pickford often stated that Tess Skinner was her favorite movie role. Well said! She played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced, she not only had to purchase the rights from Adolph Zukor but even give him credit on the films main title card. Needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning. Indeed, in my opinion, the movie itself rates as one the all-time great experiences of silent cinema. In all, an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values.#1
12350_9#Im not sure how I missed this one when it first came out, but I am glad to have finally seen it. I recommend  The Sea is Watching  to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if theyre not a fan. It is a lovely, quiet and soul sustaining movie, and one to be treasured for any movie collection.#1
2468_4#This wasnt all that great. Not terrible or hateful or anything, just forgettable. All in all, not great though.#0
6759_4#Another case of a decent DVD case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film.  Just dont have high expectations going into this, and it wont be that bad. And Lloyd Kaufmans cameo is wonderfully understated.#0
8119_10#I think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed, with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax. What cinema goers made of this in the 30s, I can only imagine. The Times said at the time, A miracle has come to the screen. Watch it and marvel.#1
2512_4#Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einsteins niece! Although hes on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (its easy to forget hes even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, its sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother.    from     #0
5944_1#Not exactly my genre, this straight-to-DVD street fight action is one I only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers. Im relatively open minded, and quite a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat back ready to enjoy myself. A run of the mill, film-by-numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to DVD status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything weve seen time and time again. And not even particularly well.#0
900_1#and not in a good way. BASEketball is a waste of film in all most every single way. It is offensive to all the senses. This doesnt necessarily bother me, Ive seen plenty of bad movies, really bad movies before and will see them again. BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it. The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a film they didnt write. Any respect I had for David Zucker has long since depleted. His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre-pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes.  Airplane  was a revolutionary and very funny comedy, watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person. And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball. My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that Parker and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script. I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable. There isnt any indication that Zucker let them improv scenes either. Parker and Stone are merely tools to a bad director. BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think Parker especially if he were allowed to take Zuckers script could have elaborated on them more. Instead we get potty humor. Dont rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around#0
1915_10#This show is awesome. I thought that the two episodes where Paul died were so sad; I actually cried. But the other shows were awesome; Kerry was my favorite character, because she was in  the dark side.  I also thought that Bridget was funny because she was all perky. I also thought that guy who played Kyle was really, really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. This whole entire TV show is funny, and I wish they still showed it on TV. when they did show it on TV, though, I watched it every single time it was on. The next time it shows, I will watch it over and over again.#1
9021_10#myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series.The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it.No doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which I would never get sick of watching.Excellent viewing and full marks to the BBC for such a brilliant series and the casting.First rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult material.So grateful to the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and Video.#1
7779_4# True  story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins polluting the waters. Amusing, though not really good, monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way. Give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy. An amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind. (My one complaint is that the print used on the Elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago.)#0
6594_10#The tweedy professor-types thought they had it all figured out. Todays peoples who inhabit Polynesia descended from migratory Asians, intrepidly moving from the Far East, island to island, eastward into Tahiti and all the other exotic tropic isles of the South Pacific over thousands of years. But the established thinking just didnt sit well with young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If that explanation were true, how come some folks born and bred in those islands have traditions, artwork, and physical features resembling not those from Asia, but South America? How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look so much like what youd find on the island several thousand miles away? Is it just a coincidence that the Islanders point out to sea in the direction of South America and say that is where their ancestors came from, led by Tiki, their equivalent of Adam? Meanwhile, how is it Norwegians speak of Scandanavian forerunners who were chased from the South American continent they had colonized, and, together with some of the native peoples they befriended, set off over the sea -- heading WEST? Its all too much to be a coincidence to Heyerdahl. With an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of crewmen, and the local know-how for traditional raft-building, an expedition begins. Its as much a trip into the human imagination as it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible with only the very basics of tools and seamanship. The Oscar-winning documentary may be dated in its tone and Anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it soars with a spirit of adventure besting even the space program that launched a decade later, as men are willing to risk it all to test a theory they think is true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It is an amazing page-turner and the perfect setup for the newsreel-style movie.#1

5426_10#Its about time that Gunga Din is released on DVD. I cannot accurately say how many times I have watched this fine film but, I never tire of it. The lead actors worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. The Soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them. At the end, Din is honored as he is made an honorary Corporal in the British Army.#1
12283_8#The photography of this bid-budget production is surprisingly bad. Colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it. Direction and editing are often quite uninspired and TV-movie like, too.  And  at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence. Hans Zimmers score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated, untalented composer. All in all, this movie really made me want to read the book.#1
7734_1#This film is the worst film I have ever seen. The story line is weak - I couldnt even follow it. The acting is high-schoolish. The sound track is irritating. The attempts at humor are not. The editing is horrible. The credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film. Dont waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting.#0
12480_10#this movie has a great message,a impressive cast, ellen burstyn, samantha mathis, jodelle ferland( was 4 years old when she made this movie) ellen burstyn and jodelle ferland have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up-coming emmy awards in new york, peter masterson-director- has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also. april 1, 2001, jodelle ferland Won, best actress in a tv drama, at the young artist awards, in studio city, ca. i can see why they have 3 nominations. mermaid is a true story, during the cridits they have the real family on the set, something you dont see often. you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores. do watch it,youll be glad you did.#1
9291_4#i cant believe that NONE of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes. Its as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesnt seem to condemn these assaults - as in, the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions, and neither does anyone else. One man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only with  you cannot force a woman to love you  rather than  you should never force a woman sexually, you jerk  From a womans point of view, the movie is a let down. It sort of  throws a bone  to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the movie is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter doesnt use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. She never even makes them apologize - rather, SHE seems apologetic. Overall, a depressing and upsetting movie, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as Hero by a long shot.#0
5274_7#Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I was growing up I saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy had worn out. Like I said, this movie is every little boys dream The movie contains a terrific setting, big muscled barbarians, beautiful topless women, big bad monsters and jokes youll only get when you get older. So, a couple of days ago I inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first, I was bored, then started thinking about how much I loved this movie when I was kid, and continued watching. Yeah, the experience wasnt as great as I remembered The acting is pretty bad, the storyline is pretty bad, the jokes werent funny anymore, but the women were still pretty. Yes, Ive grown up. Even though the movie experience has changed for me, I still think its worth 7 stars. For the good old times you know#1
2238_1#The video quality is awful. The sound quality is pathetic. The acting is horrific. The dialog is painful. The lighting is dismal. The editing is laughable. I could go on, but it would be pointless. Snitchd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film. This one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin.#0
7919_4#I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie, is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic  But thats where it ends. I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me, but I felt out and out lied to, they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they gave no hit to it at all, thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all! Its a great pity as I felt it started out as a relatively good movie.#0
5629_2#I just rented (yes! I paid money to see!) this film. OMG. It is one of the very worst films I have ever seen. As another reviewer put it, Ms. Colagrande, get out of films, PLEASE! Please never make or appear in another film! The lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe. No, thats not fair to the cantaloupe, which probably has more going for it. She does not know how to act; she affects a disgusted look ALL the time (reminded me very much of my always-disgusted young sisters-in-law from Europe). She is not charming; she is not pretty. There is no real story. And the editing! There WASNT any, that I could see! Its pretty bad when you are watching a film and, just to get through it, you press  forward forward  on your remote, and STILL nothing happens! I mean!.. I kept involuntarily screaming,  Cut! Cut!  What WERE they thinking? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a film together and get PAID to make love on screen! Pretty good deal for THEM; pretty raw deal for the viewer! I think Im going to throw up now.#0
7520_1#This movie proves that you cant judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the DVD cover. It also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it (or get it for someone at Christmas). The beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old guy from down the street) brings the college co-eds a book full of witchs spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house (where the movie takes place). After that there is some drinking, fighting, and soft core porn. Then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour. Overall, Hallows End was predictable, unsuspensful, and reminiscent of a soft-core porn. This movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, as it is a good movie to make fun of. And for first-time viewers, it is really fun making predictions of the order of people who die.#0
8706_8#What happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers? The premise may sound familiar. The Watchmen? Unbreakable? However, the Russian sci-fi action flick, The Sword Bearer, is far from the standard stock. The film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences. This is art house at its core, beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action. Its this odd mash that interests me so much in this film. The directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of Sasha and not a straight action film. Dont worry though, the action is there and plenty of it. However, much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath. This is not to say that action is not shown. These scenes are here and are fantastic (especially the ending where we see Sashas full powers unleashed in desperation). The director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the characters emotional struggle at hand. This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.#1
9283_8#In Iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be  corrupted  by bad language, close proximity to thousands of men, and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums. Based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director, Jafar Panahis Offside follows six girls, disguised as men, who are refused entry into the soccer match in 2005 between Iran and Bahrain, a match that will decide whether or not Iran goes to the World Cup. In a departure from the bleak, minimalist films we have been accustomed to from Iran over the last ten years, Offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in Iran. Little by little, to paraphrase Adlai Stevenson, that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send Iran to the World Cup. Although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle, Offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens. One can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the Ayatollahs to come to terms with the 21st century.#1
7170_9#HOLES is not your average Disney stuff- its very, very fun, even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy, focus-group designed  family entertainment  that Uncle Walts studio passes off as live-action. Perhaps the secret of this films success is in its faithfulness to the original book, which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation. But as the story progresses, Stanleys tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about an all-boy prison camp has any right to be. Jon Voight is especially nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.#1
542_4#First of all there is Gujarati Theatre then there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fan following. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theatre when making a Bollywood production. First he made Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati play) - which had a unique plot, but could not hold as a Hindi film. Now hes adapted another Gujarati play and named it Waqt - a race against time. In sum, the emotions are alien. The plot development is not for Hindi films. For example, the role play between father and son is best left to Gujarati Theatre - dont bring it in a Hindi film. Even the comedy track is best left for the Gujarati stage. All performances are average - nothing to shout about - barring Shefali Chhaya Shah who is fantastic.#0
11413_10#I thought that it was a great film for kids ages 6-12. A little sappy, but the story is uplifting an fresh. It proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true. I think that its a great story for any kid who is feelings down, or feels as if there trying to juggle too many things among them. Very cute film. Bravo.#1
3880_2#I can watch a good gory film now and then. Ive seen some pretty sick stuff. However, this is one of the few films that I found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting. I like gore films when they are fun. I like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them. The gore in this film is not creative. It is sick. It is repugnant. It is completely unpleasant. Because of this, this film is certainly not entertaining. The film is a horror film, but it lacks scares. So pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore, but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film, and thats saying a lot. The acting is terrible, the plot makes no sense, and the music is really annoying and WAY too electronic sounding. It all took me right out of the film. Pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal. Theres this guy that has a freak accident in a shuttle and awakens in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off. I guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process. Theres some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog, some dismembered head floating down a stream, and an ending involving a man being electrocuted. There were times where I tried really hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole film that I thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly, nasty, ad unappealing horror films, this one is for you.#0
9742_10#This outstanding Argentine independent film is one of the very best of the year 2000 from all South America, including Argentina, which is producing an astonishing number of quality films since 1999. In 2000 alone, Argentina released many quality films, which broke Argentine B.O. records. A half dozen were internationally acclaimed, like this one, at important world film festivals. After viewing this film, one can see how home grown Argentinian films were able last year to recapture 20% of its national movie market. So many current themes in urban Western societies are explored, I dont have enough space to go into detail. Daniel Burman cleverly weaves them into the plot with different characters personifying diverse dilemmas. If this film plays at a festival near you, or on video, dont miss it!#1
8079_8#Not many reviews, hence thought i would add one. Bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future.#1
1141_10#Anyone who doesnt laugh all through this movie has been embalmed. I have watched it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise. Fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children. Im biased, Im in love with her. This movie should have won Oscars for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Get the DVD so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years. You will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out.#1
9655_10#Maybe  Presque Rien  is not the best movie ever made But it is better than many of you have said. I still havent seen a homo-themed movie better than this one. For me, the best homo-themed movie ever.#1
10306_8#As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, it doesnt knock the area. Hallelujah! Overall, its a good-hearted film that should offend very few.#1
4401_1#We went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled. It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever. It is not that i dont like cult-movies I do. But nothing happens in the film. One does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever. endless times without dialog. And the car. How do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car? It is a two seater! I have to say however the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie, so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway.  I would not recommend it, as it is a waste of your time#0
11976_10#This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie, and Michelle) Their Mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father Danny invites his Brother-in-law (Jesse) and his Old Friend(Joey). So the whole show is about living life. The girls go through lifes troubles and have life lessons. They develop crushes, boyfriends, and many more. The whole show is basically about to go with the flow. You do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go. I think this show is really good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and still watch it today. I am glad they still air this show on television. I watch it almost every day. I rate it 10/10.#1
414_2#Going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac. So right away youre guessing who will live and who will die. The survivors end up being exactly who youd expect them to be, so no points for plot twists there. The story really lost it at the end. But the special effects were good; thats the only reason I give it a 2/10.#0
3560_8#Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves that he is. Already a success by doing sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a marvelous job of bringing this hit Broadway play to film and does it with style. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he cant sing too well. He is the only actor who could pull it off perfectly wit his sheer coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job of acting as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry. All supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny bit. Still, Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for bringing a fine musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels it normally should not have.#1
4164_3# Fans of Vivian Wu may want to check out an outstanding B-movie she is in from a couple years back called DINNER RUSH. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.#0
8_7#Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.#1
8298_7#Better than the typical made-for-tv movie, INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a high concept update to the familiar Faustian plot. Urich is likable as always and Lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles. Kind of a hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the movie commits early to its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy, maudlin denoument. 7/10#1
3419_1#OK, so, Chuck Norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced. I have one question-why? Who read this script and said,  Sounds great! Original!  This movie is regurgitated crap that I wouldnt tarnish my toilet bowel with. Of course it is another story, following in the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and so on in which Chuck Norris, of course, is the one man who can same America from some bad guys. He doesnt even need a gun most times. Its stupid patriotic jargon that stales the mind. Big surprise that the only one who will direct these Norris films is Chucks son Eric. Eric Norris has primarily worked on all his fathers films and TV shows. Doesnt this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent? Afterall, hes directing the same people as before in the same stories as beforeonly difference is the characters names. If this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the USA, than our country is in much worse shape than I ever imagined. Hopefully, this will be the nail in Chuck Norriss acting coffin.#0
11484_9#I just came back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Dayand im surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie. Basically the blame is about Coccio doing an easy and overplayed social messagewell, Mr-Im-a-reviewer, its an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge. Disturbing movieHome making and strong feeling made Ben Coccio do a very very disturbing movie.#1
4592_1#This movie made me very angry. I wanted desperately to throttle the  scientists  and unseen film-makers during the course of it. Very, very painful to sit through. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. The little good information on brain function/chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh t. The worst offenders were the crack-pot charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, is living on a higher plane. Even the ideas and attitudes that I basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed, clumsy, superior, pretentious, preachy manner that I felt the desire to disavow them. I think thats what made me so angry, the fact that theyve taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum. Much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. Fittingly, the dramatized portions with Marlee Matlin are amateurish and cliché ridden. I would refer people instead to Bill Brysons excellent survey of science  A Brief History of Nearly Everything.  Theres plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual, established science.#0
2388_3#No one should ever try to adapt a Tom Robbins book for screen. While the movie is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well reading it, is crap when spoken. Or, to put it another way, no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone elses name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl. Overall, the movie feels like a badly-adapted Cliffs Notes to the book - most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book, in terms of backstory and current story, and the ending is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from that of the book. Most of the plots from the book have gotten lost, including the one that makes everything make sense at the end, and theres more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say  Huh?  Not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned, and all the actors sent off to do something far better. I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously, but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.#0
4012_4#This show had a lot of hype but I didnt know about it until the midseason (season 1). Someone even recommended the show to me. But I decided that if I was going to watch it, I was going to wait until the end of the season so I could watch it in bulk. Due to the shows format, Im happy I waited. I imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story. Its almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show. I think I just expected this show to be better. Im interested in seeing what happens in season 2, but if I watch it, Ill most likely wait for the season completion.#0
10564_10#The wit and pace and three show stopping Busby Berkley numbers put this ahead of the over-rated 42nd Street.

12146_7#Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the westerns Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is  Presented in Shaw Scope , just like the good old days. Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure dont make fight scenes like they used to! Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday, so, if youre game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for?#1
2409_9#This movie has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness, but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is that of the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ-betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie. Judas passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can sense the angst. Peters denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerfully portrayed as the Judas drama. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and provocative Christ, whether believable or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS, to use in study or discussion groups.#1
5376_3#THE CHOKE (aka AXE in the UK) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say  supposedly  because the title of the movie does not have the  V  in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie (even though it does have the appearance of one). Fans of the traditional 1980s B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it #0
4314_4#I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons  What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they havent done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawds sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts#0
12145_10#I saw this movie once on late night t.v. and knew it was the best movie ever. This is one of the few Kung-Fu movies with a decent plot. The progression of the main character is seamless. The whole movie is great!#1
7490_4#This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and dull. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as the Perfect fair and just prosecutor (not to mention executive producer), the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path. Right after the movie ended, TNT showed the 1959 movie, Trail at Nuremberg. That movie is FAR superior.#0
6331_10#Night of the Twisters is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Devon Sawa, Amos Crawley, John Schneider, Lori Hallier, Laura Bertram, David Ferry, Helen Hughes, Jhene Erwin, Alex Lastewka, Thomas Lastewka, Megan Kitchen, and Graham McPherson. The acting by all of these actors is very good. The special effects and thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed very good. The music is good. The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like Devon Sawa, Amos Crawley, John Schneider, Lori Hallier, Laura Bertram, David Ferry, Helen Hughes, Jhene Erwin, the rest of the cast in the film, Action, Mystery, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!#1
8373_1#I was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12A here in the UK. To my dismay, this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem to me as an adult, but not good for watching with children). This film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes, getting hit in the groin etc and for the most part of the film not very funny. A Bit of good advice - wait till it comes on TV or Cable#0
9872_2#Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable. . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother, aided, abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget. The very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger whom I do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade. Also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads. I thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all. The movie I kept surfing back and forth to, had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much. Unless you like an unbelievable story, wooden acting, a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one. Oh and maybe a small carping criticism, but wouldnt a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery#0
7029_3#Phantom of the Mall is a film that fits best in the  easily forgotten  category. Its a pretty lousy variant on the famous story by Gaston Leroux, the Phantom of the Opera. Not a bad idea to itself, but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux doesnt has to turn over in his grave just yet. It could have been a lot worse.  Ill try to finish with a few positive aspectsLike for example, it stars Ken Foree   Die-hard horror fans will certainly recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! Thats like the horror milestone that yet has to find an equal. Even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessaryit was good to see him again. TV-movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor, shes a fine actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also in this but I cant stand himso my opinion about him may be a bit biased. And finally, a bit of praise for the leading actress named Kari Whitman. Shes an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talenttoo bad she never made it to the top. Actually, this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career#0
6777_4#While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review, I really didnt like this film even though it had so many similarities. Both were made just a few years apart, both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies. However, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, overall, just seemed like a cheaper film--with poor writing, little energy and some VERY broad performances--even when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this A-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio. Plus, there wasnt much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grant--an actor generally loved for his grace and class. Its sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.#0

6530_4#  Possible Spoilers Ahead   Gerald Mohr, a busy B-movie actor during the Forties and Fifties, leads an expedition to Mars. Before we get to the Red Planet were entertained by romantic patter between Mohr and scientist Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and the sight of Les Tremayne as another scientist sporting a billy-goat beard. The Martian exteriors feature fake backdrops and tints ranging from red to pink-the  Cinemagic  process touted in the ads. Real cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, an oversized Venus Fly-Trap, and the unforgettable rat/bat/spider. The whole bizarre adventure is recalled by survivor Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. THE ANGRY RED PLANET reportedly has quite a cult following, and it probably picked up most of its adherents during the psychedelic Sixties.#0
7774_7# Written on the Wind  was an enormously successful Universal picture. It could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama nymphomania, a large oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a mild touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre, mainly,  Dallas  and  Dynasty , just to mention two. Together with his other Hollywood movies,  Written on the Wind  shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen#1
12268_7#Seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear.Soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy Vietnam veteran. Trampa Infernal  is a pretty entertaining Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot  The Zero Boys .The film is fast-paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck.Unfortunately there is not much gore,so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed.However if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look.Mexican horror flicks are quite obscure(I have seen only  Alucarda  and  Dont Panic ),so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher.My rating7 out of 10.Highly recommended.#1
10915_9#RKO studios decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of The Thin Man. They succeeded to some degree. If Powell and Arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of Bradford films.#1
12293_10#This is an excellent film, and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they dont stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure, and a feeling that all is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then do. I cant wait to see it again, and wish that it could be put on general release.#1
147_9#The stories in this video are very entertaining, and it definately is worth a look! The first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks, with a great, but unexplained twist at the end. Never the less, this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all! Well worth a rental!#1
5473_8#This one is considered a key Pre-Code film  from the director who later made the musical biopic THE JOLSON STORY (1946), but also the paranoid sci-fi INVASION U.S.A. (1952)!  and features one of Barbara Stanwycks best early roles. Released on DVD by Warners as part of their FORBIDDEN Hollywood VOLUME 1 COLLECTION, the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed Pre-Release version and the tamer Theatrical Release print. Among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to Stanwycks life as a tramp from the age of 14 (though its heard in the accompanying trailer!), while many other scenes have been shortened (i.e. censored for content) the violent fisticuff which develops between Stanwyck and Hohl after she resists his advances; the seduction at the railroad car; the scene in which Dumbrille is surprised with Stanwyck by Cook; the shooting, followed by a suicide (only shots are heard in the shorter version); Stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing (again, only Brent appears in the version released to theaters), etc. Tha latter, then, utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version; however, we also get an obviously tacked-on happy ending (the Pre-Release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open-ended note) and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by Ethier to Stanwyck in New York which, basically, has the function of substituting all references to Nietzsche #1
11016_7#Good action show, but nothing new. This one took place high in the mountains, which showed some nice scenery and such. One man takes on a group of mercenaries, the lead flies, and he kicks butt. It could have been called  Rambo Goes to the Rockies , it was that pat. It did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror. Not a bad picture, but just same ol, same ol.#1
5300_4#Im one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and just watched this,the episode that started it all, on British Channel 5. It IS fascinating to think what sprung from this so-so movie and I can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of  Columbo  and added all the little touches that make it such a marvellous & classic series. That said, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode & the patronising British episode). If Columbo had been made as per the original pilot it certainly would NOT have gone on for very long, or be watched and loved world-wide. In this film Lt Columbo is smartly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, doesnt talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive. Theres also none of the cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and  the villain . Watchable, but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbo started out.#0
5083_1#I find it rather useless to comment on this  movie  for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.Its similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it. But since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance   On the other hand this movie (among others) has some value whatsoever, an educational one for it sets the example for   How NOT to make a movie.  #0
4731_4#A half-hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern day, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-Playboy magazine subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same old coy, winking clichés. A woman picks E.P. up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life--and he doesnt seem to care! Dick Sargent is grueling in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) try hard as Elvis two bosses (hes moonlighting, you see). Some of the songs are quite good, especially  Almost in Love , but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated Elvis sex-comedy--look elsewhere. When Elvis and his Fatal Attraction get into bed together, theres actually a wooden board in between them! Get real.    from     #0
5370_7#Of all Arnolds mid-80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isnt more controversial as the last, its a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have court-appointed theatrical attorneys or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows. This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.851 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters Ive seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a Meet the Stalkers gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.#1

Seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video; its the only way to appreciate it.#1

Im sorry but this movie is stupid, true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realisticthis movie a crock! A lot of bad acting  NOTE The Shower scene   Kissing Cousins  ?????? What kind of line is that?  Slipery when wet  ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This movie had effort, Ill give you that, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually.WASNT FUNNY! It was pathetic. Not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look Absolutely NOTHING like the original cast. Its as if they made them look different on purpose or something! I like watching it when Im really really really board which doesnt happen occasionally. For those of you who did like itOkay, what were you thinking? Could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? A movie is gold if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar in it, DUH! But this movie doesnt, no offense Amy Adams. Oh, yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart????? UGH #0
196_9#This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film. (I believe that Lucille Ball may have modeled her later career on Davies style, that could be termed  zany beauty .) Vidors direction is light but sure-handed, the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary, and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era, with many cameos, adds to the overall fun. It combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well. For all movie fans who have a knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films, sit through this one and it may change your attitude.  #1

4833_3#Yes, this movie is a real thief. It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance (support?) for the wars U.S. is still fighting today. I do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. I really feel myself in the 50s of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like. The same propaganda movies were produced that time, only with the exception that those were black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the  U.S. wars are cool  genre, you surely have much better movies to choose from.#0
6129_4#Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, I would not place Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians. There simply is not enough there. Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously. In any event, all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of Lloyd. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like Chaplins tramp character. His trademarks are childlike innocence, timidity of approach and a tendency to under-react to calamity by looking perplexed, batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger. The comedy in Langdons films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or naïve ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away, propping up a collapsing building with a two-by-four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross-country walking race to publicize a rival companys footwear, he manages to win by sheer luck. There is nothing here that hasnt been done far better by the Big Three.#0
12417_10#The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie started life as a satirical comic strip in Private Eye, written by Barry Humphries and based on an idea by Peter Cook. McKenzie ( Bazza to his friends ) is a lanky, loud, hat-wearing Australian whose two main interests in life are sex ( despite never having had any ) and Fosters lager. In 1972, he found his way to the big screen for the first of two outings. It must have been tempting for Humphries to cast himself as Bazza, but he wisely left the job to Barry Crocker ( later to sing the theme to the television soap opera Neighbours  ). Humphries instead played multiple roles in true Peter Sellers fashion, most notably Bazzas overbearing Aunt Edna Everage ( this was before she became a Dame ). The song on the end credits ( performed by Snacka Fitzgibbon ) is magnificent. You have a love a lyric that includes the line  If you want to send your sister in a frenzy, introduce her to Barry McKenzie! . Time to end this review. I have to go the dunny to shake hands with the unemployed#1
11711_4#An okay film, with a fine leading lady, but a terrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a truly bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the movies saving grace. Shes the best actor of the bunch. #0
7997_10#This is by far one of the better made movies and didnt leave me disappointed at all. The sound track along with finely shot hand-held camera work was exquisite . The are always chances a movie wont hold ones beliefs as well as another, but I felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. Dakota Fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent. As for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light.#1
7669_8#Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why Id have loved to see follow-up movies but judging by the rest of Full Moons output there simply werent enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasnt sure if Ms. Nipar hadnt wandered off an A-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. No, seriously! Anyway - its a shame they didnt have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.#1
7979_1#This film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham. Redgraves character was unappealing as the 60 something woman trying to compete with Thurmans 20 something for the love of Foxs character (why is beyond me). The title of the movie should have been  Shallow people on the lake . The actors played like they were in a rehearsal. A dreadfully predictable ending to boot.

1265_2#I first didnt want to watch this film, for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected filmbut as I recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising  Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité   which was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (screenwriter of  prête-moi ta main ), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that  Prête-moi ta main , would be as good as  mensonges . And it is absolutely not. The script is not bad, but it is not as well directed as  Mensonges , the actors not as generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as she usually is) as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and too be honest, I still dont understand how such crap can have such a success, even with such a casting Anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots, but it is not as good as Tirards  Mensonges  though its also written by him. Easy, unsurprising, and lazy work. Totally overestimated #0
11208_8#Oh, where are you going, my little one, little one Turn around, turn around, turn around and againyoure wondering how much has really changed in 50 years.#1
4330_1#Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlitos Way -  Carlitos Way Rise to Power (2005)  which went straight to DVDno wonder ..it completely and I mean completely S%&KS   waist of time watching it and I think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it. I dont understand how De Palma agreed on producing this sht-fest of a movie.except for only one fact that I tip my hat to Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante. reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it   Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino. too bad for him I dont think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this sh$%ty movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.#0
12189_7#Despite loving Rita Hayworth, finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler  symbolic  aspects of the cinematography, The Lady from Shanghai didnt quite work for me. I had a problem with most of the performances, the script and the overall structure. And in a film thats mostly people talking with each other in various situations, thats quite a problem. The Lady from Shanghai ended up at a very low  C , or a 7, for me. Surely serious Welles fans will appreciate The Lady from Shanghai much more than I did, and of course its worth a watch if you love Rita Hayworth. The Lady from Shanghai isnt exactly a terrible film, in my view, but its dangerously close to not  passing . Proceed with caution.#1
1644_1#Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought nothing would ever dethrone Last Action Hero, but this does easily. The movie is about 3 single guys who meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend. A fourth guy - who is married and - that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable. Avoid at all costs.#0
11728_2#Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a  worst case scenario  of playing  strong  feelings accompanied by some bad acting Dont waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy I give this 2/10 it really was awful, if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it, its all the good things this movie isnt.#0
4818_1#I was about 7 when this DIRE MONSTROSITY of a film was released. In the UK it was advertised on the TV in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were some incredible blockbuster film. It was actually the first film I ever saw at a cinema, and I was put off going for years to come. The following week I was invited to go and see the new film  Star Wars  and I declined. To this day I have never seen it, in protest at having to watch Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7 I could tell that I was watching garbage. Its just so bad, its almost unbelievable. Rambling nonsense that should NEVER have made it to a cinema. I was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again, just as well as far as Im concerned. AVOID AT ALL COSTS #0
7141_3#Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much I figured an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot. Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst movie I have seen this year. Dont get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely. The story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together. So overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend I would pass on this one for now.#0
5934_10#Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please dont entertain us what we would really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more. I was looking around to see when it was coming out. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie. Unfortunately its not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors and all the actors great job but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more.#1
6565_8#I know the film snobs are snorting. But if youre looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B-movie jungle, try  Jake Speed . I have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy,or bogging down the movie by trying too hard. Not every movie has to be the latest  Citizen Kane . And trust me,Wells was an original. So lets remember that sometimes, movies are for fun.Not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically. But just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our heros live in a celluloid dimension.#1
9434_2#Banned as a Video Nasty in the UK, Unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I found about the film was its amateurishness in all departments. The bloodletting I could handle the terrible acting, shoddy editing, awful direction, lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take. If you are a horror completist (and unfortunately, I am), you will want to see this in order to tick it off the Video Nasty watch-list. But be warnedit is really, really bad.#0
10021_8#This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces ( The Fall of the House of Usher ,  Dance of Death  (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example,  The Cat and the Canary ,  The Old Dark House ,  Night of Terror  and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. I wont go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries. Dan Basinger 8/10#1
9721_2#Who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists? Whats intended to be a light, frothy comedy about neighbor children who cant give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood, comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self-indulgence. As children, the pair are unbearably precocious; as adults theyre intolerably immature. Its a bad combination.#0
672_9#This motion picture has a steady, haunting pace backed up with great acting (one of Chamberlains best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time.  The Last Wave  is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember,  hacking and slicing  doesnt make a film a horror movie, its the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all.#1
8840_3#Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. That is the problem isnt? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie doesnt have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you dont really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, its suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example  Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time isnt the way to go here. I mean what is that?, he looks like hes on the toilet or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, its not natural, Im surprised he didnt dislocate his jaw during filming. The movie is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.#0
5934_2#I would not consider myself as one of Leonard Cohens greatest fans. He does however feature as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear Leonards reflections on his own life and career. Warming and humble.   And I cant forget, I cant forget I cant forget but I dont remember who  #0
2203_8#i, too, loved this series when i was a kid. In 1952 i was 5 and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was the one played by Marion Lorne as a rather stuttering, bumbling and very lovable  aunt  type person. i can still recall her  ubba bubba um um  type comments as she would try and say something important. And then when she came back and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched it was great casting!  i have a question if anyone can verify was the title or end credits music the  Swedish Rhapsody  by Hugo Alfven? Every time i hear it played on my classical radio station here in Southern California it brings back memories of the image of Mr. Peepers walking away with his back to the camera. im not even certain if this image in my minds eye is correct.#1
1748_8#From the very beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is possibly the funniest Ive ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm this September. I dont recommend going to this movie if you arent a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. However, when you are at the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes arent  gay jokes,  theyre just jokes. And theyre funny.#1
10872_3#Heres an indie film I really wanted to like, but ultimately could not. The lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows through and kills the picture. The story is a nonsensical mess that isnt worth trying to figure out. I quickly became bored within 10 minutes, then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes--hoping for the best--before hitting the chapter stops to (mercifully) get to the end even that wasnt worth the extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be clever, lifting its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, theres very little in OZARK SAVAGE that hasnt been done before, and better. This film would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature, it just feels padded and forced. Of course, theres no money in shorts, so I completely understand the financial reasons that I assume motivated it being stretched out to 75+ minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise, and I wish him luck.#0
2031_1#While William Shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in, (and I especially love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down. Thats a given#0
10345_7#The only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself. I usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie I dont know much about. Its unfortunate when there arent many comments for a certain tile, because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast, you dont get an idea of what to expect. I read the review before watching this title and I dont know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even when the material was not the greatest. I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable. It isnt one of the great all-time classics, but a pleasant and funny diversion-much more than you can hope for in most newer movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.#1
4477_7#This one has a lot going for it - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten -and a lesser amount of dross - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little ho hum - Kelly. It was Sinatras first real movie where the producers spent a buck and you could see it on screen (previously hed appeared in two low-budgeters, Higher And Higher and Step Lively) but if theyd only relied on the Sinatra pipes and deep sixed Graysons plus Iturbis ego-tripping piano spots wed have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for Sinatra. As it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly - We Hate To Leave, I Begged Her - to his own solos, What Makes The Sunset, The Charm Of You and I Fall In Love Too Easily. Despite this Step Lively remains the best Sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget.#1
11952_8#Scoop     out of      Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed  Match Point.  It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen. It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. This is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself. I say give it a chance because you just might like it.#1
3835_9#This film is amazing - its just like a nightmare. The bizarre story, the dark decors, the swarming insects everywhere, the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams Really great! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. It seems a little to the films of David Lynch the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. Its rather a succession of surrealistic happenings, nightmares and meetings. Thats a drawback. If the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement, I would give it a 10 out of 10. But thats missing, and thats why I gave the movie an 8. Nuit Noire is a film worth watching. Search that DVD and youll be rewarded!#1
8622_8#I just cant agree with the above comment - theres lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one, it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for its effective use of silence. Whats more, it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way, not pulling any punches in what it shows, yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter. it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema, and deserves a place amongst the canon of different horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on). Its definitely worth seeing if youre interested in the edges of horror cinema.#1
7742_8#Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern-day film noir a winner. Of the three, I dont know who was most interesting as all offer good performances and intriguing characters. The movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer, but I found it fascinating.and I dont like depressing movies normally. What I found was a kind of quirky crime film. Take a look and see if you agree. This is pretty unknown film that shouldnt have that status because its simply a good story and well-done.#1
2047_1#I dont want to go off on a rant here, but..this is the worst  film  Ive ever seen. Worse than The Avengers. Incompetent directing, disjointed writing, and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout. Shot on very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without the emotion. The lighting frequently looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just awful. The plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution, the techie elements are patently absurd, and the editing looks worse than a rough cut. Its not even bad enough to be funny. Its just bad. BTW, the packaging is intentionally misleading. Lions Gate owes me $4.00.#0
4469_2#This game has the(dis)honor of being the first game that I have stopped playing right in the middle of and felt like smashing into bits and then burning. Congratulations. FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider I will ever play I assure you. Bottom-line This game is a plot-less, no character development mess with a barely dressed unmarysuish(THANKFULLY)young women in the lead that goes through boring tombs for some boring reason(what that might be I couldnt tell you)with unimaginative shooting gameplay. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS B.S. Its gets two stars for having a women who isnt a damsel in distress(No matter how scantily clad she might be) and the beautiful into music.#0
7434_7#Thirty years after its initial release, the third version of  A Star Is Born  finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand. That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem  Woman in the Moon  from this 1976 film. Easy to dismiss, the movies career-polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywood-style clichés that variations of it exist in other films including Streisands own  Funny Girl . This time reset to the then-contemporary music scene, the timeworn plot follows self-destructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deep-dive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big break. There is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970s clothes, especially Kristoffersons mixed-fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt. There are also twelve deleted scenes included with Streisands optional commentary. One is a comic bread-baking scene which reminded me how much I like Streisand in farcical comedies. Another is an extended scene in which she plays  Evergreen  on the guitar in front of an awestruck Kristofferson who then falls asleep. The most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts, which I agree with Streisand should have been used. Fittingly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of  A Star Is Born  are also included.#1
4947_8#One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help. You have to check this out.#1
1178_2#Completely ridiculous  period  film is only a thin excuse for its extensive, graphic depiction of the heroines affair with  the beast , a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women. Thats pretty much what he does, and the films depiction of the beast is really really awful; its basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hard-on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I guess maybe this is a real turn-on. I was amused, however, by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square.#0
11014_1#This is the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life. This is saying quite a bit, considering some of the choices Ive made in film rentals. Unless you are a masochist, avoid this pile of rubbish.#0
11311_10#fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini. street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching. combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again . .. and maybe again.#1
2779_7#To  Bend It Like Beckham  may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to  Hit it Like Bonds  or  Dunk it Like Jordan.  Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player David Beckham does, much like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), does in the film Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. After satisfying the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules mother thinks shes a lesbian. The movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess sisters wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boys world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.#1
10231_1#Frankly Im rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith I wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering. Have they all been written by his pals? The action clunks along, the music is irritating and over used, the script is simply dire and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) mediocre at best. I do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying its brilliant when its not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i.e. continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture. Yes, its his first film, low budget etc. - I get it, but its also out there for members of the public to purchase and its just not up to scratch.#0
12338_10#Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian era film. She convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man, Miles Rushworth who is played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is quite good as Miles. Miss Fontaine acted her part to perfection--she was at the same time cunning, calculating, innocent looking, frightened and charming. It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joans mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this film.#1
9521_3#This film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the Leonardo DiCaprio/Tom Hanks caper of the same name. The only reason to see it is for the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I must say Matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler. If he were a woman, theyd have had him playing the MOTHER of a high schooler! (Is is just me, or is his daughter starting to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yeah, the plot--who cares? Typical teen highjinx played by adults.#0
2141_2#I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. This movie down right sucked! It lacked the magic of the first. You could actually understand every word the mice said, the animation is crappy, the palace is much much different from the first movie, theres new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible, luckily the Prince didnt have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid. Basically its like The Lion King 1 1/2 except its different stories all told by the mice. The reason Im giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable.#0
7635_10#I have seen this movie plenty of times and I gotta tell ya, Ive enjoyed it every single time. This is Belushis pinnacle movie in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you cant help but get involved once you start watching. The movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some already were big, and others were just getting started. Its billed as a feel good movie, and thats exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life isnt always so bad after all. Sometimes youve just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When youre done watching, youll appreciate the things you have a lot more and youll also be smiling. You cant ask for much more from a movie in my opinion, not to mention its a hilarious movie and youll never lose interest. Very Very underrated movie here folks. Rating from me 10 I am out #1
3686_2#I am surprised that everyone (even the critics) seems to think this was a good movie. It was the most clichéd thriller ever made that I have seen. We have the bad guy who wants to force the good guy (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequence. The good girl in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the bad guy and save the day and her loved ones. Using charisma, bravery, and even luck to save the day.  2 out of 10#0
12160_4#I happened upon this flick on a rainy Sunday, intending to tune-in to something else. Out of curiosity, I accessed the comments here, and found myself watching it to the end. I really didnt do so with intent -- this was one of those movies where youre  fascinated,  and watch it for  another couple of minutes,  until you finally just watch to the end. And the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view. The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano, and their earlier roles. But great isnt anywhere to be found anywhere here - story, performances, and particularly the absurd courtroom hi-jinks. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the 300-lb. mark), and Ben Matlock, are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom, instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them, before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of, or shown, them. No real-life judge or prosecutor would stand for this. The ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion possible - but again, fascinating because of this. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals, and t.v. movies would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd-lead (probably better if  3rd- ) roles, even in this venue. Taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them. Give this one 1 star for the story/performances, and 3 additional for the fascination factor.#0
6455_3#Really a terrible movie. Its to be expected, though. Clearly a low budget nothing all that innovative, an actress (if you can call what she does  acting ) who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene, a man in a reptile suit almost modeled after predator, a cabin in the woods, etc. But there are some redeeming points. Although the story is not new, for the most part, theres a few parts that arent so regurgitated. For one, the black guy doesnt die when hes attacked (the first time) and he isnt even one of the first couple to die. But thats minor. More importantly, theres a very interesting twist regarding Kats experiments and Wes & Steve that I didnt see coming. When Steve told Kat he knew what she did, I believed what he said and what Kat replied with. But when the creature revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the revelation. It could be because of my lack of experience with the genre, or that its a genuinely clever twist. Either way, the movies pretty bad and dont watch it if theres anything better on Unless youre in the mood for a cheap scifi flick.#0
826_3#I love these actors, but they were wasted in this flick. Debra Winger just phoned it in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked  Breaking the Waves , youll probably like this too. I hated both. 3/10#0
10949_8#First and foremost I would like to say that Im a huge Sarah Silverman fan, and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me. Everything in the pilot was in typical Sarah Silverman form, maybe not directly funny, but the situation and the delivery are what counts. Again only for the true fans, theres no way around that. If youre not used to her style then you wouldnt get why this is funny. However, it is, and I hope you think so too.#1
1631_8#This movie has it all. Sight gags, subtle jokes, play on words and verses. It is about a rag tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat a common enemy. If you watch this more than once, you will find you are quoting it like Animal House (and yes I love Animal House also). I put in the top 15 funniest movies. The Major at a boys military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this movie he is right). He is sadistic, uncaring, cruel and has to be taken down. The group of boys that do not get along at first, end up teaming together to survive and get rid of the Major with a wacky plan only Mad Magazine could of wrote. A must see - you will love it!#1
1704_8# I moved out here to get away from this kind of thing!  The small town sheriff laments. The Martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on. Its a fun family movie.#1
7542_2#This movie is suppose to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes into the movie, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I cant imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blonde girl or when he  bear  punches that old lady. The lines, characters, and acting are all poorly done from the get-go. Ive always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made some terrible movies this year; this being by far the worst one (yet). I wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story-gripping thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original. However, if you intend on watching it, get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously; thats the only way you enjoy this film.#0
7243_2#no comment - stupid movie, acting average or worse screenplay - no sense at all SKIP IT!#0
873_8#I watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it. I loved it. A very good, tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and the ex-con, and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried.  The only thing that didnt quite work was that the supposedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat solid, certainly, and far from conventionally beautiful, but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it. Superb. I wish she was in more films, and better ones than she generally is. Ive seen a bit of Gilles Wife and a bit of The Moustache, and they both looked like rubbish, and Ive seen all of De battre mon coeur sest arreté, and that certainly is rubbish. She seems to have a few coming up, so Ill keep my fingers crossed.#1
4578_9#I, as a teenager really enjoyed this movie! Mary Kate and Ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease. I thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to! Be sure and rent it  Also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players! )#1

4114_1#There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And WHY DO THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS BAD??? The premise is absurd. Thre acting is one dimensional. The special effects are overdone. And the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots Hollywood ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad it didnt happen that way. Tempted to turn it off several times, I stuck with it to see just how bad it could get. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, dismal scenario.It is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive-in in off season. Apart from the general awfulness of the film, I worry deeply about its impact on young audiences. The Americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!#0
7053_7#Dont mistake  War Inc.  for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. It isnt. For all the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge.#1
10982_3#Movie had some good acting and good moments (though obviously pretty low budget), but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed. The main point of conflict between the two leads doesnt play out in a realistic manner at all. There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it, but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently, especially since the employment of Glenn is so wound up in this part of his life (and Adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money.) Also, several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is (apologizing to Adam for his past) while Adam is shown to be upstanding and  traditional,  which the film proclaims to be the  good  way in the end. I dont like being preached to like that. I attended a discussion session with the director after viewing LTR, and he said that he presented this conflict between them because, if he was in Glenns shoes (and he said he does in real life relate to Glenns view) that he could never date someone with Adams views. Well, then, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film. Also, director said he directed this, his first movie, only after reading (Directing For Dummies.) Directing was not that bad, but far from a top notch effort. Ive seen worse, but I rarely leave films feeling this frustrated.#0
12404_9#I was living Rawlins when this movie was made and I got lucky enough to be able to work on it. Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see all the behind the scene workings, from the Barbedwire coming alive to the Electric chair up through the wardens office floor. Also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called  Disney Gate  by locals. If anybody is interested and is ever in Rawlins, most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour. It was a lot of fun working for and with R. Harlin and wished I had a chance to do it again.#1
7875_7#Page 3 is one of those films Madhur Bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth. The film is compelling, but, like most of Bhandarkars films, it is one-sided and overly pessimistic. This film is all about tabloid journalism, gossip, celebrities. The film exposes the lives of socialites, whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful, peculiar and repulsive. They party, they care for nothing but fame, they plan parties at funerals, they are craving for more money and a higher reputation, they will do anything to get due exposure in the media, to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspapers social column known as  Page 3  with huge photographs which will be the center of peoples discussions. They are attention seeking, salacious and hypocrite. The film industry is shown as sleazy, with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers. Thats where our lovely heroine, a young social column reporter Madhvi Sharma, is thrown. All these people from Mumbais elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article. Later in the film we learn that even those who are Madhvis friends are no different from these high-society people. This was tough viewing for me, although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting. The films music is average. The only passable songs are  Kitne Ajeeb  and  Huzoor-E-Ala , sung by the two melody queens Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle, respectively. Otherwise the soundtrack is bad. One song which was particularly horrendous is  Filmy Very Filmy . The films writing is quite good. The second half is far better than the first, as it turns more matter-of-fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse. Thats where the film has to be applauded. It was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and Konkona Sen Sharmas characters disappointment was very easy to relate to. She was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive. Atul Kulkarnis part was very small but he did full justice to it. Boman Irani is solid as the newspapers editor. Sandhya Mridul is lovable as Madhvis sassy roommate Pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it. The films ending is really well-done, and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings. Page 3 is a good film, it is interesting and at times moving, but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated, overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous.#1
4090_8#This movie is simply incredible! I had expected something quite different form the film that I actually saw. However, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior. Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual, for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-brow sort of pornography. It even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape. Go see it! It s worth your money and time #1
8502_1#I seems in the beginning a interesting film, a Spanish thriller in a interesting nowadays Madrid, but it isn`t none of that, is actually a film only interesting for future films directors learning about what not to do making a film, it can`t be worse in others words, even the presence of a oscar winner ( Mira Sorvino ) isn`t enough to justify the $ 3.00 dollars expended to see this film , the acting is horrendous and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home, it lead to nowhere and is boring, weak and bad, don`t expend time or money on this film.#0
5908_2#This one is a little better than the first one. It still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old Bond movies were not realistic. That wears thin after so many parodies. The girls were more interesting in this one. There is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor. Hopefully one day real comedy will come back.#0
8702_10#A woman borough a boy to this world and was alone. They both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was capable of withdrawing sword from his arm. There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this  gift  - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside of his body. First he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mom every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. Just as simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches the justice.but the society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous which is indeed right cause it is not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - Sasha (he is the main hero acted by Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blames from authorities and runs. In such a runaway from authorities and Mafia he meets a girl (acted by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else is to be watchednot told. Be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions but not about actions. This film is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life.#1
466_8#This was an exteremely good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius Luzhin and brilliantly portrays the characters manic affectations such as his strange dancing. Emily Watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover Natalia. The relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by Gorris and familiar Nabokov preoccupations such as eternal innocence (i.e. Lolita) are evident in this film. I think I will now go on to read the novel. It was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!#1
2245_7#Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal doesnt even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that Salva capitalizes on. The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.#1
6806_7#Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of that time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life.  I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these movies. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call them kitschy, but I will never give up admiring these films. They are IMPRESSIVE  UNFORTUNATELY, HIGHLY UNDERRATED!#1
5960_8#Its great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot. Also loved hearing her sing. Nice change to see her out of her CSI/West Wing/ER roles. The movie itself was entertaining, but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts. Several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why. Each character was quirky though and in some cases, I couldnt wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This movie wasnt full of squeaky clean people, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them.#1
11973_4#This is probably one of the worst French movies I have seen so far, among more than 100 french movies I have ever seen. Terrible screenplay and very medioacre/unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless. with all that it doesnt matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story. It amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes, man, I love almost all the awarded movies in cannes, but not this one. A major disappointment for me.#0
11801_8#I read a few reviews of this TV movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment. I agree that perhaps, the film goes on a bit too long (2h30 would have been enough) but I certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter. Jim Jones expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness, paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a voyeuristic manner. The movie takes its time in showing how Jones recruited followers (Brenda Vaccaros and Brad Dourifs character are stand-outs in that matter) but also in observing an uncanny shift in Jones perception of reality. It is mind-boggling to see an egalitarian, left-wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator. Perhaps the movie doesnt explore Jones motivations enough, which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times (may have to do with censorship as well) But Powers Boothes mesmerizing performance makes it all come true. I am not familiar with the details of the real Jim Jones life, but Boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real. The movie features many strong scenes, among them the preaching messes of Jones, Joness meeting with Father Divine (a remarquable James Earl Jones), Congressman Leo Ryan (Ned Beatty)s visit to the Guyana camp and of course, the suicide scene. It is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and Boothe is quite commanding in those last moments. Madge Sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower, and so do Veronica Cartwright (as Jones wife) and Brad Dourif, especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion. The relative calm of the end of this scene, the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to erase from ones mind. A disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses. Worth watching, if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century. Not to let it be repeated again. Like, ironically, the inscription in Jim Jones camp  Those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it .#1
11555_2#A great slasher movie -- too bad it was the producers and not part of the script. Basic plot summary - man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success. Only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as I did and chopped the heck out of the movie. Nothing flows, you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time (didnt he off that one earlier??), and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke. Not that I can blame him I passed out 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist. Warning when you see the ending DO NOT try to connect it with anything that happens before -- you will just get an aneurysm. Not worth the time, effort, or God forbid money. Only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that I watched.#0
749_10#This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion, its thought provoking, funny and sad with amazing performances all around!. All the characters are wonderful, and the story is just brilliant!, plus Jodie Foster and Cherie Currie are simply amazing in this!. The Ending is very powerful, however I wont spoil it for you, and I thought the character development was top notch!, plus you can really relate to all of the characters, especially Jeanie and Annie, as you will be rooting for them!, plus I loved how it moved slowly, and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about. I cant believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion, and it was funny seeing Randy Quaid in this type of role, plus this is extremely well written and made as well!. One scene that really got to me was when Madge(Marilyn Kagan), is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party, and the film has many surprising moments as well!, plus the dialog is especially excellent. This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time (In my opinion), its thought provoking, funny and sad with amazing performances all around, and i say Go see it immediately!, your bound to love it!. The Direction is fantastic!. Adrian Lyne does a fantastic job here, with awesome camera work, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Jodie Foster is really cute, and is amazing as always!, she was extremely likable, caring, had a lovable character, was intense in some scenes, was focused, and she and Cherie Currie were the heart of the film as Jeanie and Annie!(Foster Rules ). Cherie Currie is way hot, and is amazing here, i really felt sorry for her character, as she had a very likable character that just needed help, she gives a powerful performance, and created a very memorable character she was amazing!. Scott Baio is great as Brad he was really likable, and did his job well i liked him. Randy Quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him. Sally Kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot. Marilyn Kagan and Kandice Stroh are both very good as Madge and Deirdre, and did what they had to do well as the other two friends. Laura Dern has a very early role here, as it was cool to see her, not much of a part though. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall go see it immediately, its an underrated masterpiece!.       out of 5#1
5518_1#I havent seen this, & dont plan to see this movie or any other that includes Lindsayunless & until  poor little rich girl  straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in July 2007. All of the foregoing is merely my OPINION. I have no inside information.#0
3609_8#Went to Wal-Mart and found this film on DVD and had no idea whether I made a bad purchase or a good one. It is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end. Michelle Rodriquez,(Diana Guzman), BloodRayne ,05, gave a great performance and her looks are beautiful, sexy, and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed. Diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother. She decides to get boxing training in a local Brooklyn Gym and is not really well accepted by the male boxers. In her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys. There is lots of action in the ladies bathroom and references as to private parts of guys. If you like boxing, and seeing a hot sexy gal do wonders in the ring and knock the boys on their you Know What, this is the film for you.#1
3071_4#I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasnt worth my time, or my friends. I think this story is not worth telling. Its like saying that old people have a past before they got old (no kidding). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. Ive always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. Im writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try.#0
222_1#As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a  chick flick , and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell isnt much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent  plot  (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didnt have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then theres the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE. Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.#0
12493_8#After all the crap that Hollywood (and the Indies) have churned out, we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments. There are some clichéd moments, but Im not sure its possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie. Theres not much new hereits just done well. This is not a masterpiece by any means, but it IS a good, old-fashioned scary moviesomething thats rather rare nowadays.#1
1779_10#I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! It is that damn good! I am not much of a fan of movies but I gotta tell you this one opened my eyes. Astounding color and fast energy. I was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the Zoinks! Film Festival in Boston, and the story really enveloped me from the start. It had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. That would be fun. My only problem with it is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya. UGH! She SUCKS! Ive seen a block of wood pull out a better performance. I dont what the director was thinking when he cast her. But if you ignore her you cant help but give this movie a big ten #1
296_10#Sublimity is the way we have to reach for The Beauty. And sublimity is the stuff this film is made of. If not his best, its my most loved of all Bogdanovich movies. This unique masterpiece remind us, as most of the other films from the director, what life is (or should be) about love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. As the song from whom the films takes its title (Gershwins well known composition) the film makes the impossible true, and tries to make us aware that no-one is able to judge anybody; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies, almost without a line of dialogue, constructed upon the looks and views of the characters --with that  Bogdanovich touch  based on the point-of-view-- is a class on Cinema Language, something that P.B. learned well from his admired directors from the Golden Age of the Movies). With a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack (including the best of Sinatras  Trilogy ), this movie, full of self-consciousness and compassion, and far away from self-indulgence and emptiness (as some critics wrote), deserves a better place on the History of American Cinema than where it have been placed. Its not  long on style, short on substance  it is complex in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.#1
558_10#Classic drama/action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of its time(1954). The production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love.Unique peek into the American NORTHT WEST pioneers is very educational and entertaining.This movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many  lawmen  during this particular time and place were very crooked/corrupt much like most developing countries today.The action sequences could have been more realistic though but still,this movie really covers most of the essentials.Not for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy.#1
7065_7#Cute film about three lively sisters from Switzerland (often seen running about in matching outfits) who want to get their parents back together (seems mom is still carrying the torch for dad) - so they sail off to New York to stop the dad from marrying a blonde gold-digger he calls  Precious . Dad hasnt seen his daughters in ten years, they (oddly enough) dont seem to mind and think hes wonderful, and meanwhile Precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man. The sisters get the idea of pushing Precious into the path of a drunken Hungarian count, tricking the two gold-digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good-looking Ray Milland, who goes along with the scheme cause he has a crush on sister Kay. This film is enjoyable, light fare. Barbara Read as Kay comes across as sweet and pretty, Ray Milland looks oh so young and handsome here (though, unfortunately, is given little to do), Alice Brady is quite good as the scheming mother - but it is Deanna Durbin, a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister Penny, who pretty much steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings several songs throughout the film, though I actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this. The plot in this film is a bit silly, but nevertheless, I found the film to be entertaining and fun.#1
4686_10#This is by far my favorite film of all time. Thats mainly because its not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. However, I dont think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members do a fine job as well. #1
6657_1#I really hate this retarded show, it SUCKS! big time, and personally I think it is insulting to fairy kind (if you believe in fairies that is); I mean the people who had come up with such crap ought to have their heads examine huh? and also there is a LOT of craziness (the evil school teacher, which I think is getting really old) and also stupidity (the boys parents and fairy godfather) in this show - two of the things that I dispised and loathe in the WHOLE world (especially stupidity). Overall, I say that this show is so f      annoying and should not be seen by prying eyes at ALL (it would makeem bleed to death)!#0
6163_2#Hooper is Not Funny, Not Fasted paced, Not romantic and Non informative. There is no real drama. You would think that a movie about the worlds greatest stuntman would have some drama, there was an attempt but it didnt seem real. No Character study, no lessons learned, it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun, they were just trying to act like they were having fun. There is no reason to watch unless you like to look at Burt and want get an occasional glimpse of Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time#0
1992_2#Dont let the name of this film deceive you, In reality Jake Speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film. When Jake Speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen, which he is often not, hes seriously relaxing. Perhaps this adds to his charm, but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to  chill out  whenever he gets the chance. Furthermore, unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless of course you call sleeping a talent. Anyhow, this movie is basically worthless, the writing is sub par and the action, when there is some, is very lame. (The machine guns on the jeep werent bad, but thats about it) So, if youre in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - It has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep, but also his audience.#0

12325_9#I first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the BBC when I was working on UKs 2000AD. My pal Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Up till this point, Id really only seen the Shaw Bros kung fu movies, with their harsh lighting (so audience could see the moves clearly), so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to the movies of Tsui Hark (pronounced, apparently,  Choy Huk ). Enjoy Chinese GHOST STORY by trying not to view it through a filter of Western culture and youll get on with it just fine.#1

997_4#Having just recently re-viewed  Lipstick  for the first time in a few decades, I backed it with  Descent  even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine. As the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what weve seen before, only in a more graphic rendering. So what?#0
7430_4#Its interesting to see what shape Pierce Brosnans career was in before Bond arrived on the scene. In this  tense  thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the gentle Patrick, who works leading ghetto kids on  confidence courses . He romances a woman, who has a bog-standard mop-top mid-90s kid called Eric. The womans drunken ex-husband soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with Pierce. #0
3197_10#If you are a Crispin Glover fan, you must see this. If you are a Sean Penn fan, you must see this. If you are a movie fan in general, you must see this. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this film will probably still have a lot of value, but the more work youve previously seen by Crispin or Sean, the better. Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find. I managed to find a VHS version after some diligent searching though, and there are a couple of ways to find it that I know of. But I really wish someone would put this onto a DVD.#1
12347_1#This is easily the worst Ridley Scott film. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way. It is really not difficult to make a film such as this. Everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody. The writers didnt have much inspiration either; many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all; and some brainless action. I strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish. I hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess.#0
959_7#There are many police dramas doing the rounds. I am not sure why. Its probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil. Well cast but not my idea of an evenings entertainment,#1

12373_7#Time has not been kind to this movie. Once controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz best-seller, now this film looks like a mere mainstream version of your typical spookfest. Gruesome touches aside (particularly that crazy, over the top finale), this is essentially a glossy horror movie for those people that do not care much for the genre. It has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast in order to convince the audience that this is not your average lowbrow movie (producers of 70s disaster movies had a similar idea). I kind liked to see the familiar faces, but the story is very silly, and no matter how high class the film pretends to be, it operates at the level of your average 70s exploitation movie (not an entirely bad thing, though). Still, it is an enjoyable movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing. As usual, Albert Whitlocks matte work is outstanding. Overall, pretty entertaining.#1
2951_1#Do not see this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective viewing, me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course. The only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer. I recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall.#0
8520_8#I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good the F/X and stunts were well done. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out OK.#1
6587_9#The Master Blackmailer, based off of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles short story,  the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton,  is the first feature length Sherlock Holmes story with Jeremy Brett that I have seen. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a somewhat dreary, sad feel to it, but it is quite entertaining (with some especially funny scenes). Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual), and Robert Hardy as the notorious villain (most audiences probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a riot). I give it a    1/2 out      . My only complaint is that there wasnt enough Inspector Lestrade. (I wish they would have added in the scene at the end of the short story where he gives the description of the two burglars, one of which matches Watson.)#1
7472_9#I really liked this movie. Ive read a few of the other comments, and although I pity those who did not understand it, I do agree with some of the criticisms. Which, in a strange way, makes me like this movie all the more. I accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public, yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch. I also love the movies, such as this one, which provoke so many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext. Congratulations Mr.Crowe, definitely in my Top Ten. P.S. Saw this when it first came out whilst I was backpacking in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to get back to my hotel and I had a major paranoia trip! Where does the dream end and the real begin?#1
6979_3#I watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children.. The terror on this mothers face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. And the sad thing is--internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains. All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has. I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed. Im surprised this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This also was a route for the poor from the mountains.#0
12061_10#Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror,diamonds are crafted, and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance. This is no less than a diamond  This is a film brimful of eeriness,chilling anticipation, and dark atmosphere, and I think its safe to say, one of my favourite horror films of all time! And of course it contains probably the single most, flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror! Every time I see the film, and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be frightened out of my wits, but it never fails to happen; I never get it right, and I find myself as terrorized as the first time I saw it  Now, it must be said, to scare a jaded horror fan like that, that is nothing short of pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the Brits know their subtleties, they take pride in the art of acting, they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent story, and the creepiness(in this case)of suggestion and anticipation. Every single element is impeccable, from the set pieces, the acting, the story, to the menacing atmosphere. Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper, thats for sure  As an end note, if you for some demented reason dont like this piece of insanity, then you honestly dont know what horror is all about, and frankly do not deserve to know it either. Thank you!#1
11181_4#The movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call-girl, the other an upper-class political party. The crossing point is the public relation character played by Al Paccino, as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening. Maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on Als talent #0
6790_10#This game is one of the best RPG. Fist, It is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system (you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can transform into dragoon, the special attack, the magic). The script is very good. Characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support, as happened in several games of Final Fintasy series. I got bored of that dialogs about past, when you just want to go on with the games story. Ambientation is a jewel on this game, it combines Middle-age fantasy with futuristic science fiction. Its remarkable that animation effects are just incredible, i like them more than other in other modern games (we cant remember that Legend of the Dragoon is 8 years now). Then, Map is huge, there are all kinds of places an enemies. Finally, Music is not the best game muse I have heard, but its perfect for a game like this.#1
11314_1#This movie is probably the worst I have seen. Bad acting, bad script, bad everything. Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still its Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well! I rated this movie 1/10.#0
942_10#This is the best film version of Dickens classic tale. Ive seen it over and over on VHS, and recently acquired the DVD version, which is formatted for TV (not wide-screen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films/shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward,  the Equalizer , as the Ghost of Christmas Present.#1
6907_2#No artful writeup here because it doesnt deserve one. Not an art film. Not even one of those hidden gems. You know, like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good independents and art films. Just pack it into the christmas boxes, and dispose of quickly.#0
4624_4#This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) It wasnt an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. The Twilight Zone always stretched the imagination and credulity. Normally no one cared. But this episode seemed hamstrung by a Calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine, or downright carelessness.#0
3359_10#Una giornata particolare is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces.It is in these dull,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scolas two leading characters.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them.All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Lorens character.All women would surely cry their hearts out at Marcello Mastroiannis existential plight.Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber,poignant film.Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities.Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women.This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction.His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks.A word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as a real man who does not beg for pity.He happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life.A true masterpiece of cinema  #1
4336_4#I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe its just me, but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie, starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didnt know. Rise to Power is just a movie that has Carlitos name. There should have been at least a few characters from the original movie, the ending makes no sense in relation to the original. In the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie? And his woman isnt even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original. I would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self, with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to its big brother. Dont lay awake at night waiting to see this, watch the original one more time if you really need a hit.#0
6638_4#A note to all of you budding film writers Study this film. If your dialog reads like the dialog in this film, please shred your script and try again. If you cant nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break, you havent seen enough of this kind of Holiday film. Maybe thats a good thing.#0
9653_9#First love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema  the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous. Whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest, it is not without hope we get to see Cédrics slow, painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat he adopts, then through work in a local bar and finally contact with Pierre, who may be his next love. But here the story ends A teenage passion, over within the year, another perhaps beginning. So what was it? Almost Nothing? Certainly not when youre living it#1
4398_2#Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is I totally regretted it! These two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant, unimaginative and kitch to the extreme (not that this is bad on its own)sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but fail to do so. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-I cant think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack havent disappointed me ever since. I would recommend you to avoid this film, unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled.#0
5511_8#Part II or formerly known as GUERILLA, is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as PART I because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of Che Guevara. Once again, Im impressed by the cause-and-effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories. Were reminded again and again that the lead character, Che Guevara is an Argentine. Some of the men in Fidels army chose not to take orders from a Foreigner and now that Che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in Bolivia, he doesnt get much respect from his new army and the natives either, only because hes a foreigner. I like one particular scene that illustrates Ches deteriorating condition, a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly Che tries to direct it, and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there, he forgets hes a doctor, and he becomes this desperate soldier whos stabs his own horse. His army is like a horse that doesnt want to be led. But at the same time, the film drags, it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that youll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part, you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another, but maybe that is the intention of Part II, if so.. then it definitely works. Standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of Ches last breath. This movie may not answer the questions of why Che Guevara was so stubborn, why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants South America to have the same fate as Cuba but the movie CHE is a story worth telling.#1
6433_7#Several posters have quoted Renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling to camera. The short answer is wouldnt we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so. At this stage of her career Bergman couldnt get arrested; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a picture in Europe, fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year, after making this for Renoir, she was back where she belonged and with an Oscar to boot for Anastasia. This is one of three movies that Renoir made in color around this time and on balance its better than The Golden Coach, which isnt hard, and about even with French Can Can. Renoir probably figured that with so much going for her Bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and Renoir picked two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history but Renoir is content to give it a once-over-lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up. In its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period Les Grandes Manouvres which is no bad thing. All in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress.#1
6931_3#A stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients. Despite an initially hostile response, he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor. And, as the doctor shows him about, he talks and talks and talks  And as he talks, loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive. While there is SOME action here and there (and some of it quite disturbing), its amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is--lacking life and energy, which is odd for a horror flick. Even a guy who thinks hes a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome. The further this tour takes the guest, the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers. Yet again, despite this twist, the film is amazingly lifeless in many places--particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set. Only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell, starving, does the film have any real impact. Considering this plot, it sure is hard to imagine making it boring, but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have! Now with the same plot and competent writing, acting and direction, this COULD have been an interesting and worthwhile film. A final note The film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene, so be forewarned--its not for kids. In fact, considering how worthless the film is, it isnt for anyone! However, with the version included in the  50 Movie Pack--Chilling Classics , the print is so incredibly bad that its hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark.#0
4021_1#This is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of Roger Corman is associated with it. I couldve understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets but nowadays there is no excuses for giving birth to this! Im a  B  movie pervert and from certain people point of view all the flicks I love are put aside by  regular viewers  but take my word on this one, Vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worst.Its hard to Imagine, vampires with no fangs, the music score is totally out of place,the sound effects are just not effective and finally Mr.Savage doesnt seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad cause he had a  not to bad  career over all. Let me know if Im to hard on this one cause when I dont like a movie I tend to forget about its good side.#0
3880_8#Well, for starters, this actually was THE most elegant Clausen film to this date.  Id have to say its one of the best movies Ive seen this year and Im greatly anticipating his next.#1
6083_3#Two kinds of movies we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. We ought to have liked A Man Called Sledge; BUT.. Of the last 30 older movies rented from Netflix or Video Vault, this was the rock bottom, the only true dud in the bunch.#0

2321_9#Heres the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly, its for two reasons. One, it concentrates of young people, VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and  The Man in the Moon  is a magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens, its the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs, will believe it for the rest of their lives. The cast of  The Man in the Moon  is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young, talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, shes going to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way.#1
2799_10#As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film, although secretly I hoped it might be East is East II. The trailers looked fun so I thought Id give it a go. Tip Dont leave before the credits. Once the lights came back up I realised to my horror that perhaps I shouldnt have watched this film after all. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice. Oh, what am I saying, it was absolutely brill and I cant recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. Im a student. I only splash out if its really worth it.#1
5080_10#When ever a film is produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet your life any of his pictures will be seen for generation after generation. Just having Claudette Colbert,(Ellen R. Ewing), The Egg & I ,47 appearing and starring in the film will make it even more of a great Classic Film. In this film, Ellen Ewing gets married and then she encounters all kinds of mental problems and even murder. The mystery gets very much involved and Robert Ryan,(David McLean), Battle of the Bulge ,65, comes to the aid of Ellen and sometimes you even wonder about David being on the up and up. As you view this picture you just about find yourself beginning to understand who is the real nutty person and all of a sudden, you begin to change your mind how the film will end. Great acting by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan who played an entirely different role than he usually portrays on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer, was married to a great film star, Audrey Hepburn. Great Classic film, with great Classic Actors  #1
10966_9#Grey Gardens is a world unto itself. Edith and Little Edie live in near total isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. Cats loll about while mother Edith insults her daughters elocution. This is a Tennessee Williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights, as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. This film is a must-see for anyone writing a mother/daughter relationship of this kind. It is sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly. It is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context--remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion.#1

9261_3#Since Id seen the other three, I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series. As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece; its a travesty. The film goes along the same route that many series go down when theyre running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. Its always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. The film does keep a thread with the original, which I wont reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donners original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia (not Damiella or Damiana, fortunately). Theres a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as shes menstruating at eight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses The first two sequels to The Omen werent bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three. I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing its likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl. Indeed, Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that shes the Antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the evil she does is laughable. Faye Grant is given the meatiest role, and doesnt impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused. On the whole, this film really isnt worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and doesnt even do justice to weaker second sequel.#0
7686_10#After enjoying this show for years, I use to dream of being able to see them all again and share them with my grandchildren. I am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that I have found recorded on DVD. Florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband, one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night. Michael, the baby son is a freedom walker and JJ is a clown. I know many Afro-Americans disliked this show, but I know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was. My heart was sad when I learned that Ester Rolle had passed. Tyler Perry is now the leading writer actor of today and I support his work, but not as much since he made such cruel mocking of Rolle in one of his plays. No one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance. The show started getting less interesting when Daddy James died. It picked up a bit when Florida remarried, but slumped when she took an absence from the show. In all, the show was great and again I am pleased to own copies of part of my past. I do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of Good Times, and I must say, they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumors. I think children of today will enjoy this show and I have no problem sitting and watching with children. Congrats to the writer, crew, and stars for years of renewed memories of a time that I can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes. OK so I watch the shows over and over. Lately I have noticed thing that has made me rethink the series, but not dislike them. I think Florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made. Not that the children did not need supervision, but it was done in a way that makes Floridas mothering different. The scenes where Florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now. When James was alive, the show made a big thing out of James wanting his own Fix-it shop, but never lived to see his family out of the projects, but Florida marries someone who owns a fix-it shop. A bit of a slap in the face to an actor who should have ended his time on Good Times showing that he accomplished all he strove for. Lastly, As I watch the shows, I see the series going in to overtime and being renamed  JJ . To be truthful, after James left everything mostly centered around JJ. Not a bad thing, just a noticeable thing. I would not trade my DVDs for any amount of money, but time, maturity and experience began to guide your eyes after a while.#1
5050_1#Oh my, this was the worst reunion movie I have ever seen. (That is saying a lot.) I am ashamed of watching. Even for sitcoms, this was the most implausible plot since Ron Popeil starting spray painting bald men.#0
3776_4#Believe me, I wanted to like  Spirit . The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old-fashioned, hand-drawn animation again, as if the last pencil-animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago, and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete, had got my blood up  but then, the insulting, flavourless banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of  Spirit  got my blood up even more. As often as Spirit talks, Bryan Adams sings, sounding as usual as though hes got a bad throat infection - and its not THAT he sings or even HOW he sings, its WHAT he sings maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less, if possible, than Spirits spoken narrative, and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune (although I was paying close attention, and was able to discern that they probably didnt). If only Bryan Adams and the guy-pretending-to-be-a-horse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two, the movie might have been allowed to take its true form mediocre and derivative, rather than jaw-droppingly bad.#0
4281_1#This movie can be labeled as a study case. Its not just the fact that it denotes an unhealthy and non-artistic lust for anything that might be termed as caco-imagery. The author lives with the impression that his sanctimonious revolt against some generic and childishly termed social ills ( Moldavia is the most pauper region of Europe ,  I dont believe one iota in the birds flu ,  Romanian people steal because they are poor; Europeans steal because they are thieves ) are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude - but he is sorely off-target!  The most serious side of this offense to decent cinema is the fact that the production received a hefty financing from the national budget, via C.N.C. (the National Cinematography Council). The fact that long-time-dead old dinosaurs like Daneliuc are still thirsty for the government udder is understandable (in a market-driven economy, they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection). But the corruption of the so-called  jury  that squanders the countrys money on such ridiculously scabrous non-art, non-cinema and non-culture belongs to the criminal field.#0
3114_9#Im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you. This movie is awesome. From beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills. The fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are enthralling, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained, but that is only because everything that preceded it. Damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role. He is this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy CIA agent out to kill Bourne. This is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. The ending is left open for sequels and I sure hope that they consider doing more of these, for none have been bad. Excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy. P.S. The shaky cam did not hurt any of the action, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is, you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action.#1
7230_1#I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong The story (or actually the lack there of) was completely uninspired and lacks imagination - while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story. The dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term bad performance. Bad acting wouldnt have been such a huge problem if only director Bilal didnt take himself so seriously; all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic, it looks like Bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here. Well, theres no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk, only pretentiousness! This man should really stick to making comics, since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in Van Helsing look like live actors! And since half the characters are CGI-animated, it is quite a problem that the CGI-effects look so fake. If the Egyptian Gods actually exist then Bilals a dead guy, since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie.#0
7437_10#Recently, a friend and I were discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950s versus today. She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who, in 1798, wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner. Both of us had been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in English Literature courses in college. My friend said,  Its messages even might be called metaphysical within todays context.   Highly recommended.#1
11093_2#If this movie was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on  facts  that are shaded very unfairly toward Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of  racist  judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be (was arrested multiple times for beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60s and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now thats inspirational) Based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie, I would suggest passing on this one.#0
568_1#This  Debuted  today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is  I am speechless  I taped it today so I could watch it tonight after work. I had high hopes, Now I am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so I can hang myself. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like  It was fun to make fun of this movie  but this movie is giving me nothing to work with. I know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but I am going to anyway  This movie sucks  There I said it! They should show this flick to film students to show them what NOT to do! My nine year old niece could make a better film. The only decent thing about this film is the sound and/or sound track. OH! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old tool box. I am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just tape over this VHS but I think I will burn it in the fire pit instead. I could wash with soap but I fear I will never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike#0
8343_7#Australian Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) directs this comedy/ romance that is fun, relaxing, and set in the spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is an auto mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, which gets higher with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them by their preppie shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, Youve Got Mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einsteins niece who is a competent, but not so confident mathematician. Perhaps it is because she is surrounded by all that genius. She thinks that if she marries someone with a high I.Q. her kids will have a high I.Q. as well, but she does not knows what she wants. Between Tim Robbins cute smile and Megs cuteness this is a refreshing movie. I love sweet stories. People all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to the jerk James Moreland, who works in animal behavior, but is very stuffy. This is a love a first sight type situation, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Witty lines and subliminal lines! The cinematography is nice. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the Spring. With much help from all those brilliant men Catherine falls for Ed, without knowing that he is an automobile mechanic. Favorite Quotes Albert Einstein  Dont let your brain interfere with your heart . Ed Walters  When was the last time he said  Wahoo  ? Catherine Boyd  Well Im sure I dont know . This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have the tape and every once and awhile I will watch it again.#1
3550_1#I run a group to stop comedian exploitation and I just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for,  Last Comic Standing.  If they dont have a GOOD agent, then they dont even get a chance to audition so more than 80% of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent! If they do make it to an audition, I was told that its  pre-determined  if they get a second chance. So what the TV audience sees is NOT the best comics in the US. Please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized http www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y#0
9969_1#I joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film. I wasnt drawn in for even a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick. I would bet (and hope) that everyone involved in Teachers looks back with embarrassment. There are some great actors here but you would never know it. Thank God it didnt destroy Morgan Freemans or Judd Hirshs or Nick Noltes or Laura Derns careers. There was no vision, no labor of love here, only a horrible effort gone wrong. BTW I dont think the writer ever set foot in a real school.#0
12070_7#I have always been a great admirer of Nicolas Roeg and  Walkabout  is one of my favorite films. This is a film version of Roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of Roegs cinematic flare. Very unique story is about a famous actress (Theresa Russell) who after a hard nights work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor (Michael Emil) and together in his hotel room they talk. After awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door. Her husband is a famous ex-baseball player (Gary Busey) and he wants to know what is going on. The three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them. Meanwhile, a famous senator (Tony Curtis) is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesnt testify at a hearing. Theresa Russell is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate Marilyn Monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobias and nuances that Monroe is very well known for. One thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well. She talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage. You can make an excellent case that this is Russells best performance and I probably wouldnt argue. The film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions. Busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen. Emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought. The last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side! One of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man (Will Sampson of  Cuckoos Nest ) and they discuss what Cherokee Indians think about at all times. But of course the famous scene in this film is where Russell demonstrates to Emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this. The professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we! Russell and Roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together. Good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film.#1
10497_4#So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs, snakes, lizards, tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles, and mud, not only daily, but with enthusiasm. He was never able to make ME want to do it, but he managed to make his wife come close. I was hoping, though, that there would be a bit of a sequel, where Steve and Terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still cant believe we wont see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and the discovery channel, at least. I cant imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is. Crikey #0
11942_8#In the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop. Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid in her investigation, seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop. Title (Brazil)  Scoop  O Grande Furo  ( Scoop  The Big Scoop )#1
7536_10#The persons comment that said that Pat Robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare what evil and righteous is. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good! He doesnt even know that he fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you dont know God and refuse to know him now, thats okay. He still loves you but when you do finally bow your knee to Him, and you will, it will be too late for you. God sends no one to hell, not even you! You will go there of your own decision and your spewing defines it! May God have mercy on you and give you a Damascus Road experience. The 700 Club and Pat Robertsons ministry is one of the reasons Im still here. On the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God reached through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God He did! You have a right to say what you said but you dont have a right to curse with your words. God have mercy on you.#1
3105_3#I cant believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness. Of course, Brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they dont eat quite as often. Brooks movies have become worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin .#0
11524_7#This is a quirky little movie, and I have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well. Not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about the journey, then I think youll like this one.#1
1103_10#This film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film! The plot is somewhat lacking, but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please. As a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining; and with major stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas how could you go wrong?  Comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued, and is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments. Achieving true comedic dialog is an art.#1
11795_1#This is the worst movie ever made. The acting, the script, the location, everything! I would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie, but even they were bad. You would think that a movie with the word  beach  in its title would have good-looking women in it. Wouldnt you?#0
9690_4#Jean Seberg had not one iota of acting talent. Like all her films, Bonjour tristesse suffers not at all from her looks (though she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom Tom Wolfe gleefully, accurately describes as  boys with breasts  publicists, of course, use the word  gamine ) but suffers grievously from Sebergs dull, monotonous, killing voice. In all her films when had to play anger, Seberg played it with grossly audible, distracting, gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalizations. Oy. In sum Bonjour tristesse is pretty to look at but its shallow, immature soap thin gruel with suds.#0
1505_3#A quite usual trashy Italo-Western, stupid storyline full of clichés and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punch-fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale. Its also remarkable that JOE dAMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi did the cinematography - I love this master of incompetent exploitation-thrash, so it was an  aahhh  for me.#0
1363_1#This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a  motion  picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same  story  with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. Its just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching  Love In the Time of Money , but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people walk out before me.#0
11660_1#Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films. he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie. scary movie 2 was OK too but everything else Keenan has made are real disasters. avoid such titles like dont be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood.. i know, what a title   obviously this film too, just anything that has Keenans name in the credits. it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me on this, maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films.. 1/10.j.d Seaton#0
2956_1#From the What Was She Thinking? file Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice-age. Straight-to-tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high-concept in search of itself. Apparently this was a labor of love for its writer-director, Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); sadly, the end results are anemic, to be charitable. Goldbergs mere presence on-screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script, but here shes drowning and you can see the unfunny results. NO STARS from     #0
11704_3#One of those,  Why was this made?  movies. The romance is very hard to swallow. It is one of those romances, that, suddenly,  click  - they are in love. The movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments - the drive-in restaurant being the most notable. Charles Grodin does a credible job but for most of the movie its just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, do you want to watch Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with her neurosis together for a hour and half?#0
176_7#BEWARE SPOILERS. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it. Okay, so the goofie foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny. This guys boss was good, too. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have had a lot more time on screen together. Theyre chemistry was great. The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, yummy. #1
5394_4#I do get irritated with modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director cant make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it. If its using the original words in an updated setting, thats particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in period styles, eg the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian very effectively. It could work with the 30s setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeares text. Unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show.  Accolades however to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely splendid as the older couple.#0
9666_1#Having seen  Triumph of the Will,  I can only say this movie is ghastly, even measured against the historically low  standards  of the time. Naturally its all totally fabricated and prejudicial. This is what one would expect of 1930s German propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation, itself, is hackneyed and cheap. Its also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary Germans mustve left the theater holding their noses. In a genre renowned for its base appeal, lack of originality and unapologetic wrong-headedness, this film doesnt even qualify as  bad.  It would have to improve significantly to attain that status #0
828_2#Lets see. In the  St. Elsewhere  finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child.  Newhart  ended by telling us that it had all been a dream. And  Roseanne  ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind. Very  creative . Annoying was more like it. Yes, it was just a TV show and wasnt at all reality. Its just that when you get caught up in a great movie or TV show you end up at least wanting to believe that its all  real . At least as far as the reality it portrays on screen. This type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat, frustrating and simply not fun to watch. Now  Newhart  being all a dream? At least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. The idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the Best Series Finale Ever. Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.#0
8219_1#Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when Im picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul.#0
3952_1#Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesnt play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show. I have seen the first movie I dont want to see the same scenes over and over again and I dont know who would. The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it.#0
956_9#The simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film, and also relates to the dogma films. Other german crime films like Derrick, Der Alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects. These cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder. Good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view, even more if you know that part of germany a bit.#1
3412_1#First, IFC runs Town and Country, and now this. The difference between that stinker and this Pink Panther rip-off is that Town and Country was watchable. This isnt. The real  Crime  (besides this being green-lighted) is Shepherds character a mousy wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for a half-million bucks! If you buy that, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona you might be interested in #0

4433_7#The story On the island Texel, photographer Bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and lust for life intrigues Bob, who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. Her life is not so simple as it seems, however. Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to win his trust? Review The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the characters psychology would have been worked out a little more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? This is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view. The story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify that. So you dont get to know the characters on that deeper level. The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and believable way, but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this characters naiveness doesnt quite work for a grown-up woman. Camera-work is nice, and there are some great shots of the nature on the island. I give the movie a 7/10.#1
9578_10#As others have mentioned, all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous. The plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around they want to be pursued, but when no  men  are around, they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love.#1
8506_8#. . .but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy. Id really like to own the movie since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and at the time I saw this movie, I was driving that model bus. It was only (during his murder trial some 15 years later) that I remember vaguely that OJ was one of the stars in it. I only recall that he was the driver and of the bus being shot up and driven wildly. Ive been looking all over for this movie to no avail, since viewing it in the mid-80s. I liked the movie, I dont usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide, and viewing its beginning (although fuzzy) I stayed for the whole thing.#1
9571_9#I gotta be straight-up - I havent seen a film as solid as DOG BITE DOG in quite a while. Im a big fan of the  old-school  late 80s to mid 90s era CATIII films, and I had been hearing that that  style  of films is making a bit of a come-back with films such as this, and Herman Yaus GONG TAU (which as of this writing I have not yet seen), so I was very interested to give some of these newer-wave CATIII films a shot. Did this film live up to my expectations? Absolutely - but not quite in the fashion that I imagined. I could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film, but I dont want to give too much away. I watched DOG BITE DOG knowing nothing about the premise, and I think its the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way. As to comparisons to the older-style CATIII filmsthere are some similarities. DOG BITE DOG has some hyper-violent moments reminiscent of the  good ol days , but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old-school classicks like THE UNTOLD STORY or RED TO KILL. Where many of the older CATIII films main intention was to  shock  - DOG BITE DOG is a far more thought-out and well-rounded production (though thats not to take ANYTHING away from those CATIII films that I hold so dear). This film is far more  emotional  than it is exploitative, and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds, the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides. There really are no clear-cut  good  and  bad  guys, as Mad Dog shows moments of extreme compassion, and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer. Theres also no nudity/sex in this film, which is a typical characteristic of the older CATIII films. Personally, I would compare DOG BITE DOG more to Parks SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE or perhaps the Pang brothers BANGKOK DANGEROUS, as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence. Again - theres pretty much nothing that I didnt like about this film. The acting is dead-on, the cinematography is sharp and well done, and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isnt seen very often. Is this film (and others like it) the  rebirth  of the CATIII film - not exactly - but it IS a very solid film thats absolutely worth checking out9/10#1
3974_8#The Drug Years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini-series or other kinds of TV documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on TV. Its actually not long enough, in a way. All of the major bases in the decades are covered, and theyre all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides. But it almost doesnt cover enough, or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time. For example, the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs (partly the marijuana, later cocaine) is really well presented, but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover. Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary? No, but for some summertime TV viewing for the young (i.e. my age) who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago, as well as for the old who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks, careless times, and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it. There are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased, which is not totally untrue, but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social, political, and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving (for better or obvious worse) for enough of a fascinating view.#1
9578_4#Can A-Pix ever, ever, ever do anything right? This movie was meant to be seen on TV in a letterbox format. Since A-Pix doesnt even believe in pan and scan, we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side. Of course, not that you are missing much. This movie is incredibly bad. Its very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80% of the movie for no reason.#0
7872_10#The first review I saw of Page 3 said  what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say? . Should he say something so decisive. The movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic. I wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead. So watch Page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times.#1
2347_10#I have been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the very beginning. It is wonderfully thought up, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show. With a magnificent cast, wonderful script, and hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is, by-far, one of the most remarkable shows on your television.#1
11926_10#The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. Pam Dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospects and make this work of art a must-see. Academy Award winners Brenda Fricker (Home Alone Lost in New York, A Time to Kill), Ben Johnson (The Last Picture Show, Red Dawn), and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Village) amplify the atmosphere of the movie, drawing in an anxious audience. However, the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O. Sanders (JFK, The Day After Tomorrow). Spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. This one is a diamond in the rough, and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace. Did I mention a cameo by Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill, We Are Marshall) for all you ladies out there?#1
12217_10#I went to see Ashura as 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, that was one cool kick off. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but due to health reasons, hes still in Japanoh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies. As far as cinematography goes, the esthetics are pretty interesting. Its by far, the movie that looks the most like a manga. Its creamed full of special effects and nothing, at all cost will prevent this movie to look realisticits pretty amazing. Lots of colours an  unreal  photography, other than thatits pretty straightforwardbut like I said, the main character is carrying the movie A must see, a tale lead by masterful hands#1
5935_4#The saddest thing about this  tribute  is that almost all the singers (including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have missed the whole point where Cohens intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise, Cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry, his irony, his all-round humanity, laughter and tears in one. A sad show, really, and sadder if you truly love Cohen as I do.#0
4501_7#This group of English pros are a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast could form a series of their own. Its a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. Only the superior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the sexy Robson Greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable  romp . The only quibble is that its hard to accept that the smoldering Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a British sex symbol. You can readily understand why Robson Green would light her fire, with apologies to the  Doors . The guy who almost steals the show with a great  laid back  performance is Owens father David Bradley. Watch him in  The Way We Live Now , in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchens secretary, sometime sex toy, is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes Kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Greens sidekick surgery buddies as Ive said could have their own series. They are that good. The whole thing is a great deal of fun, and I heartily recommend it, and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue.#1
2145_7# Shall We Dance? , a light-hearted flick from Japan, tells of an overworked accountant and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he sees from the train during his daily commute. What he finds in the studio are lessons in dancing and, most of all, himself. Funny, poignant, and utterly charming,  SWD  is an award winning film well worth a look by more mature viewers. (B)#1
880_4#Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at  modern day  Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene the same way defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from Janssen, who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a neer-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dads lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately,  Where Its At  doesnt have much else going for it other than the now-dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, some quick T&A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, ad nauseum.    from     #0
11734_10#This has to be one of my favourite flicks, unlike the weak Elviras Haunted Hillsanyway I love the way the movie is a goth/com Wizard of Oz story But aside from this, the fact that one of the sequences she  ripped off, umI mean was inspired by FlashDance  is pure geniusand if you dont roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her  very 80s  Las Vegas show then you havent got a camp bone in your bodyThis movie is a Cult/Camp Classic#1
1113_10#Sandra Bernhard is quite a character, and certainly one of the funniest women on earth. She began as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s, but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorseses underrated masterpiece,  The King of Comedy . Her film career never quite took off, though. She did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures, such as  Dallas Doll  (1994) or  Dinner Rush  (2000), but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself.  Without You Im Nothing  is undoubtedly her best effort. Its an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show which made her a superstar  and Madonnas best friend for about four years. In ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes, Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performs songs made famous by Burt Bacharach, Prince, or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich got Sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance thats both sexy and uniquely funny. If you are a Bernhard fan, you cant miss out this film; its a tribute as well to her (weird) beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne. And it has influenced filmmakers in their work   Hedwig and the Angry Inch , for instance, would look a lot different if  Without You Im Nothing  didnt exist.#1
3208_4#This movie was a great disappointment for me. I had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut out half the story line, but they altered information. The statement that Lucifer is Hopes Father is untrue. He did corrupt her father, but he himself is not her father. The voices also did not suit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death do not watch this movie. It just did not do the comic justice at all #0
6713_2#But this movie was a bore. The history part was fine but the musical part was not. Not one song I cared about and no soundtrack to be heard. Shouldnt you be humming the songs after a musical, except for a few chirps, nothing else was worth the breath.#0
2536_7#The thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein; and theres a very good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. The plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film. The plot focuses on the good hearted Dr Janos Rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth. His discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in Africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it. However, tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element; which makes him glow in the dark, and also sends him mad The biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and both give excellent performances. Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for Karloff to impress with. Bela Lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what were used to seeing him in, and its a great performance from him also; its nice to see a bit of versatility from Lugosi. The film does get off to a rather slow start; but things soon start to pick up. The second half of the film is the best and thats really when the film gets exciting and Karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). The film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and it does work very well. The film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely. Overall, The Invisible Ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties; but its a very good one and comes recommended.#1
8808_1# ASTONISHING  Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must have been referring to the fact that such a sorry piece of crap was ever released. The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals, and murder innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin peels off throughout the film, we also see severed legs, heads etc that are about as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set. There is an awful lot of talking b ll  ks, a bit of human cuisine and some weird zombie hunter chap who imprisons the sufferers of said skin illness in his closet strapped to a chair, before stabbing them in the head, chopping them into bits Do you enjoy this film? Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of said cult. Do they pocket your wages? Do they let you see other family members? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson films till you think hes the best director since A.Hitchcock? Do tell this sounds like a Panorama special brewing to me. And say hello to the critic of the LA times when you return to your colony, will you? 0/10#0
12175_7#What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a Hawaiian guy bar? All smooth sailing until he takes his  bachelor hat  off. What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance? A new low, right? Well Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low. I got to say this is one of his good leading roles. However I do believe his role in Vanilla Sky was better acted. Eliason A.#1
12296_8#Fragile Carne, just before his great period. Although it is sometimes hesitantly directed, and marred by longueurs, HOTEL DU NORD is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of French films of the late 1930s, as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director. All of his great virtues are here the cramped interiors broken up by gliding, complex, delicious camera movements; a melancholy deployment of light and shade; remarkable, wistful sets by Alexander Trauner, which are so evocative that they, as the title suggests, take on a shaping personality of their own; the quietly mournful music of Maurice Jaubert; a seemingly casual plot about romance, tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time, in this case Louis Jouvet and Arletty. The films principle motif is that of water - the credits float and dissolve, the hotel stands by a waterway - but instead of Renoirs open river of possibility, we have a canal, stagnant and manmade, going nowhere. The film begins as it ends, and the setting never changes, except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return. Characters can only escape through death - their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy, the walls and frames that hold them captive, the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve. Any hope at the end, therefore, is profoundly, if romantically, compromised.#1
1321_10#Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie$(2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khouris book Forbidden Love, and THAT was a best-seller. An onion-peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman, Lie$ is the very best in editorialised reality TV. Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.(10/10)#1
4105_1#Another too bad the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise this would get an easy zero. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact were Peckenpahs name not on the thing I would never have guessed he did it. Actually one of the people in San Francisco I know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that Sam was just plain snockered. It shows in spades. The laughing bit at the early part of the film is the ONLY thing in this entire mess worth a second look. Not even Gig Young is watchable. This is a true test of masochism. Had I been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it I would have jumped up screaming. And now I truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than made up as they went along. Its not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards. Yikes #0
214_4#Considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign, I would have expected something to be worth the fuzzfrom the opening scene on (in which the two brothers  sensually  caress each other, laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwardsnothing to get the attention, not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers, saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing). The too curious viewers will not get any interesting sceneat this point, that could have saved some of the movieso you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be saidbut please watch the movie yourselvesI am an egoist and I would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their liveslike I did (#0
430_1#Wow. This is really not that good.   /    #0
2856_10#This is one of the movies that get better every time you see them. Its packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in Sabus subsequent movies (I didnt see  Unlucky monkey  yet, but the other ones are as great) failure, chance and humanism play great roles. The cutting and Montage is inventive and artistic, without the movie being an  art  picture, but a highly entertaining one. When comparing it to  Run, Lola, Run  you have to keep in mind that  Dangan Ranna  was made some years before and was shown on German TV as early as 1997so its more probable that it served as inspiration for Tom Tykwers movie, and not the other way around. Complementary to the other reviews I have to add that I like the acting and the ending very much. This movie is a lot of fun in many ways, and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.#1
12411_4#There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isnt one of them! Its a shame The Child isnt better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). This is all well and good, except for the fact that its boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; its not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. Theres really not much I can say about the film overall as there isnt much to it. The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly dont recommend it.#0
10285_10#David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `House of Games, a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel, Driven. Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; theres an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability. When a patient, Billy Hahn (Steven Goldstein), confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that theyre going to kill him if he doesnt pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf. This takes her to the `House of Games, a seedy little dive where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna), a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. Instead of the `twenty-five large that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if shell agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the `tell of one of the other players. By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. The dialogue, and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing. As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her. From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a `tell is and how it works, to the lessons of the `short con, to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. And nothing is what it seems. In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself. She changes; and whether or not its for the better is open to speculation. Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does. Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, self-assured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well. The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum (Joey), Lilia Skala (Dr. Littauer), J.T. Walsh (The Businessman), Ricky Jay (George) and William H. Macy (Sergeant Moran). `House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; hes written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. Youll find it under `Perfection. This is one great movie you do not want to miss. I rate this one 10/10.#1
420_7#This film provides the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. He, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Calamity Jane, are the central characters. There are numerous historic anomalies in the film, but it retains the flavor of legend. Pretty good for the 1930s.#1
5352_7#This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know that, Ive saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review. If you dont like Arnold, then you wont like this movie. If the case is the other, then you will very probably like it. Its as simple as that. If youve seen Arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one. Enjoy.#1
3215_2#The movie has one nude scene A man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen. It is quite a long scene. What was the point? I almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasnt funny to have THAT staring at us for what seemed like a full minute. #0
11755_3#this is a great movie. I love the series on tv and so I loved the movie. One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold  that was great. i loved it it was pretty funny too. Its a great movie! Doy #0
3573_7#this film was almost a great imaginative film. A mixture of shakespeare, pop, jazz, and faerie tales. This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. Featuring a strong cast, headed by the perfectly cast Kathleen Turner, this movie had everything going for it. Everything but production values. I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with an over the top production like this, it came off with the same seedy quality as every other made for tv movie. Besides better cinematography, this film was almost perfect. #1
1453_2#Im not sure it was the language or the poor acting, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake. Whether its the English or the fact that Ive already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.#0
11353_9#This movie was excellent. It details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in Russia during the 80s. I give this movie high marks for its no-holds-barred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated (thanks to the  Regime ) community. This is a graphic movie. It presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and its tragic remains. Nothing is  candy-coated  with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This movie is based on Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. Im familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film. Its not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this movie is a must-see.#1
3632_7#As predictable as a Hallmark card, but not without merit, The Rookie makes for a solid outing. Dennis Quaid, the most reasonable jock actor working today, is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris. The film is never dumbed down for the children, as would be expected from a G rated film. As a sports film, The Rookie is one of the best I have seen since Any Given Sunday.#1
11035_8#Four prisoners share a single cell the domineering transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcuss idiot savant buddy, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches, cockroaches, and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping. After a brick falls from the wall of the cell, the men discover the hidden journal written by a Fountain of Youth-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this journal the secret to their escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind it? -AP3-#1
5748_4#I have to say I hated this movie. I dont like to say that because Gerard Butler is in it. About a half an hour of boring conversation, sorry to all who actually care about the plot, I started fast-forwarding to Gerrys scenes. I really dont know the ending, I was that bored with it. If Gerry wasnt in it, I probably either done one of two things fell asleep or turned it off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, as he is with most of his earlier movies. If youre a fan of Gerrys dont worry, hes as adorable and precious as he always is, but if you actually want to watch the movie for the plot, good luck because youll need it, either that or lots of coffee or soda to keep you awake!  4/10and thats just because the casting director had the sense to put Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea of how to spell his name!#0
9248_3#Weve all seen this story a hundred times. You can see each plot turn coming a mile away. The relationship between the mother and daughter is way too sweet and understanding to pass for realistic. Janet Mcteers performance is stock southern hot- ticket mother in vintage clothes. Should have been made for the Lifetime Channel.#0
8346_9#I just watched I. Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world. I love the allusions to Mozart all throughout from the opening with  Einstein  playing  Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star  on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of the Ed Walters. I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, an especially unique situation for the 1950s, the time in which this movie is set. (I myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children, so please dont think I am some staunch womens libber.) Its wonderful how a man who is  only a grease monkey  is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as Catherines fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. There are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you dont watch and listen carefully. I highly recommend this movie. It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that, what a great cast is assembled here. Watch it and enjoy #1
2542_3#not that all Disney films are garbage. Anyway, I saw  Legend of Boggy Creek  first and absolutely loved the film. When I heard it had 2 sequels, I was ecstatic. I finally found a copy of this and watched it one night. I dont see how they can make a G-rated sequel to a horror film. The original is a movie/documentary about the Fauke Monster, and can scare anyone.  Return  is for kids and should not be watched by anyone. I dont remember the plot too well, as its been quite some time since I watched it and I will not watch it again, but Its about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill Bigfoot. Three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them. A big monsoon comes through. The hunters get hurt, are saved by the kids. Then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm. Then all of a sudden, Bigfoot comes and does something really sick. I dont wanna ruin the ending for any of yas, but its not scary. Well.#0
9421_10#Contains  spoilers  - also, my quotes may not be exact. #1
8909_9#This is a pretty well known one so i wont get too deep into it. The basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor. Human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger. Nobody believes the teens (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it seems that the blob cant be stopped. Its really well done for its age and unlike a lot of other 50s flicks the pace is pretty fast. The story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. If you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from 88 as well.#1
6392_10#This independent, B&W, DV feature consistently shocks, amazes and amuses with its ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them. Its all hilarious and ridiculous stuff, yet as absurd as much of the film should be, there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded, keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here. This film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad. That seems to be the heart of the film. For as insane and off the wall as things get, Leon, the 30 yr. old paperboy-protagonist, always tries to keep it together. Hes like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best, so that everyone can have what they want. #1
5919_9#Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you just watch for fun. It is not a comfortable experience, although it does have some laugh-out-loud moments. This is a movie you watch when you need food for thought. If youre the sort of person whos willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices American culture still holds, and if youre not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye, this movie may be for you.#1
11711_10#Ms Patty Dukes story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles. I saw myself acting out just like her. I was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children. I wish I could thank Ms. Patty Duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka#1
9664_1#This Book-based movie is truly awful, and a big disappointment. Weve been waiting for this move over a month. Many film reviewer were hopeful for it. Also in newspapers and TV, it made big sense. When 29th April comes, many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful. Why? First of all story was so monotone. It has been many indefinite scenes, sometimes its hard to realize whats going on. The actresses, out of Hulya Avsar, werent harmonized with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She acts better in comedy films, In this movie, a kind of drama, she couldnt disposed of her previous role. And finally Movie is too short, just 66 minutes.#0
3259_7#This isnt the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable. Its directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne isnt bad in her role as the woman who cant get over her husbands death. She has a sexy maturity. But I cant say much for Ryan ONeal as Philip, because he is, at best, nondescript. He may be adequate in the role, but thats not good enough. #1
9592_4#Ive seen the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I hoped to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The  princess  is not very talkative, as you may have noticed She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who only stared to make his point, then beat the crap out of the opponents. During the entire movie, I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked, why was she fighting, who did she love and trust. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialog. Dont watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds! Its so bad, that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour. Approximately. I give a 4/10.#0
9844_8#There are very few movies that are so funny as this one. I was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater  reserved  for movie buffs like me, so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes At times the story was a bit  slow , but that is perhaps for the best - a bit of rest in-between the rolling amongst the aisles (I nearly fell out of the seat) was most welcome.#1
7517_7#Although The Notorious Bettie Page is well acted and shot, is is, at best, a Cliffs Notes version of Betties biography. The film mainly centers on her work with Irving and Paula Klaw, the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos. It does not detail her life after posing, aside from her religious rebirth. It cites  The Real Bettie Page , by Richard Foster as a source, but it ignores Betties later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital. The narrow focus of the biography can be debated, but the majority of Betties fans and the  civilians  would probably be more interested in her modeling career, which is what they get. The film is well done, if rather shallow. It is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances. It hits the high points of Betties life, but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth. The ending is rather a let down. It feels rather abrupt. Still, the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in Bettie, or even the time period. The soundtrack is great, really pulling the viewer into the 1950s. If nothing else, the film stands as a showcase for Americas burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its Puritan past. Its also a peek at an icon for both men and women.#1
8546_10#This is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made! Although Ive only seen forty minuets of it and I must say this is a good movie. The plot if funny and because theres sex around pretty much every corner of this movie. Its really funny and I dont see how anyone could NOT like this film. I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie. It has one slightly sick scene in it (trust me, its not very pleasant) but apart from that this is a great movie. I rate this movie an 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. PLease if your a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where theres pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie. It WILL please you. 10/10#1
6589_4#Im afraid that I didnt like this movie very much. Apart from a few saving graces, its nothing to write home about.  Being a fan of giallo movies, I was expecting quite a lot from  Nightmare , but unfortunately I was quite disappointed.#0
10108_1#German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible hes unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made. I wont spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is its perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on or should I say his geist.#0
3526_2#(Spoiler included, some would say) This film is not possible to take seriously. At some parts it is so awfully stupid that I just cant help laughing at it all. Try me for the sequence where Stallones character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite. Yeah, what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats? I dunno, but he sure gives reality a run for the money.#0
7592_3#The 1930 were a golden age of Los Angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy. People were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams. Expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom, majority then condemned to live starving, disillusioned and unwanted, searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms.  Feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right. Their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm, far from real passion, feelings just described not felt inside. It is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted, turned into a grey average of soon-to-be-forgotten.#0
4437_1# The Triumph of Love  doesnt triumph over anything. It is a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. Actually its a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed much longer. It pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are not quite as awful. Maybe they were trying to be so over the top, so as to be clownish, but, if so, I didnt see it that way. Mira Sorvino doesnt make an impression one way or the other. She(he)s just there. My guess is, the play of the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is much better. It couldnt be any worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent production of the play. I dont know what she was thinking when she created this bomb.  Maybe it all got lost in the translation.#0
4807_4# Ambushed  is no ordinary action flick. Its much to bad to be ordinary. One man walks toward another with a machine gun blazing. The other man fires one round and fells the man with the greater fire power without so much as a nick from the hail of lead raining down on him. Guess which one is the good guy. Duh. Such is  Ambushed  through and through. Not a good action flick, not a good drama, not a good movie,  Ambushed  fails on all levels with its cast of B-movie veterans mechanically going through the motions almost as though they know theyre making a real loser. Not recommended for anyone. #0
1011_10#I LOVE Jacks jokes like The cliché is or  Over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, kinda spooky . He is just hilarious! Daniels starting to catch up on him to! Good thing Jacks not on the team anymore (in a way) or else it would have been sarcasm mania I just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, Im starting to pick up facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and TealcIt just all theoretically possible and excitingoops! Their I go again  Sorry, Im also starting to pick up traits from Carter, and all of this is driving my parents NUTZ  Well, to conclude, I think its good for another three seasons or so, especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so forth #1
11587_2#This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It offers nothing in the death department. The one-liners are bad and are something that shouldnt be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th one, but still one the worst movies of the series. My rating 2/10#0
3828_3#By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they went ahead and made it anyway. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldnt it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubbish.  This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. Its tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. Theres no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. It takes an eternity to get going, but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, this might be the very worst film that Heston ever made. Im sure its one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious CV.#0
8185_8#This gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated. Its pure delight and fun! Gratuitous servings of blood, insanity and black humor, which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre. A full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot. Only for the connoisseurs.#1
732_7#Well, I have finally caught up with  Rock N Roll High School,  almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summers new documentary  Patti Smith Dream of Life  sometime around 2040!) And no, the film doesnt feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, adorably played by P.J. Soles, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book  Cult Movies,  quite accurately describes Mary Woronovs performance as an  evil Eve Arden. ) A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some truly rousing tunes. Riff is, of course, the 1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a bakers dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total blast. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing to  Teenage Lobotomy  at this blowout may be the pictures funniest moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing  I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,  is quite exhilarating. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kids wet dream. Fun stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder.#1
9712_1#This movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history. Horribly inaccurate, this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built  over the bodies of the white man  as stated by the head Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself, isnt even close to accurate to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What of the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent. Their friends were starved, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists. Those that didnt die of dysantry, starvation, or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times.#0
246_3#This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Vernes  Mysterious Island . The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the directors voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress.  OK now stand up.  As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actors voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Pipers early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? A must watch for aspiring film makers.#0
4097_8#Youth, sexuality, and the French countryside -- one of the more unique films youre ever going to see. If you can see it that is, no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) Its sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting, and occasionally funny. A trifle boring also in the middle, but all in all you cant call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until youve seen this one at least once.#1
12124_1#Any movie that portrays the hard-working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored, cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the Clinton era. Its little wonder that this movie was written by a woman.#0
10751_10#To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible. Every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images, through to the last shot of the clean up at Ground Zero, but every frame is real. The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York. Jules (28) and Gideon (31) Naudet (pronounced  Nau-day ) want to make a documentary on New York City Firefighters, beginning with a  newbie  from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter. Seeking the help of their close friend, actor James Hanlon (36), an actor and firefighter at Station 1, Engine 7, the Naudets sift through the  Probies  at the academy and find one, Tony Benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on. #1

11013_7#There were a lot of films made by Hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public. Seen today, some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda--which they technically are, but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation. This film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre--having a pretty realistic script and good production values. Pat OBrien plays pretty much the same character he played in MANY other films (you know, the tough-talking, hard-driven but  swell guy ). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombardiers in training). While the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews, the film is well-crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That it, perhaps, except for the very end--where the film is a bit over-the-top but also VERY satisfying. About the only serious negative, and this is mostly for nitpickers, is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and  nuts  like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this--all others probably wont notice.#1
7905_10#I feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is. I feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and CANT suspend reality and/or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes aways from their boring or busy lives! Get a GRIP people. ECGTB is a very ENTERTAINING movie. If you take movies seriously, this is NOT for you. If you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in ANY way, this is not for you. But if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, or the  what the hell am I watching  of Moulin Rouge. Or the gross out comedy of  The Sweetest Thing  Then let yourself escape to Cowgirls. It has some really funny parts. Hilarious actually. It also has some really good music;kudos to kd.lang. Also did I mention it has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman..need I say more?#1
10292_3#It has its merits; Morvern Callar is both the merits and the disappointments. Shes so enigmatic, so original. Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one thats making her so distant and un-relatable? Or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary? Personally Id call her dysfunctional. Its really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest. Its little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer. They manage to make Morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you dont care about the characters or the film.#0
5152_1#The worst movie in the history of cinema. I dont know if it was trying to be funny or sad, poignant or droll, but the end result was unwatchable. Everyone from Key Grip, to Robin Williams, and back down to Best Boy should be ashamed to be a part of this film!#0
1062_10#I think this show is definitely the greatest show. Jessica Alba does such a great job in it. Michael Weatherly also does an awesome job, as well as the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing. Its like watching a 1-hour movie. Its definitely worth watching.#1
5858_1#This was allocated to the fans as the  winner takes all  match occurred between two separate  companies  (the World Wrestling Federation and the  Alliance  an amalgamation of former WCW and ECW superstars. Because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tag-team match, the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another; each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match, interfernce is necessary. Each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches, executes a special move, and tags in a partner. The storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of Vince that a member of the Allance would be fradulent and join the WWF. It was obvious, with that statement, that the WWF would prevail. Overall very innovative storyline but poor execution, which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag-team. The remaining matches are just revolting Because Stone Cold was the WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was the Hardcore Champion, and Kurt Angle was a  mole  in the alliance, all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of  the Alliance  were granted work after the matchs outcome, except for Booker T., who recently attacked a wrestler on  Raw  and will inevitably be given work. Shane McMahon will return to television somehow, and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of  the Alliance  to see Stone Cold out of work. The WWF has done much better. A match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better, and what ever became of Casket and Iron Man matches?#0
12322_10#This movie is one of my favourites. It is a genre-mixture with ingredients of the Action-/Horror-/Romantic-/Comedygenre. Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards. This minor flaw is easily ignored. There is so much to discover in this story. The romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. The visuals are beautiful too. The action is great which is no surprise, it is originating from Honkong, birthplace of the worlds best action movies. The humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way. Somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good. Absolutely recommended.#1
8049_7#Overall I would have to say that I liked the movie. Some of the fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise, Sammo copies Bruce Lees fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars.#1
4852_1#I saw this movie once, and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said  Watch it again, its better . So I did. And to my surprise, it was WORSE on the second time! Theres a word limit, so Im going to get the ball rolling here. The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favour, just skip this, and dont give into the hype.#0
6268_9#Carter Wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance! The pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going. The flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them. Although the story isnt strong, the action is fun and draws you to the very end (which I felt couldve had a sequel). Campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu #1
7574_4#But it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting. Nevsky acts like a body builder and he isnt all that attractive, in fact, IMO, he is UGLY. ( his acting skills lack everything! ) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character needed to be developed. There are way too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action, and way too dumb of an ending. It is very violent. I did however love the scenery, this movie takes you all over the world, and that is a bonus. I also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. The actors needed to be more handsomeThe biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be hot enough, but for us ladies that are fans of action, Nevsky just doesnt cut it. Overall, this movie was fine, I didnt love it nor did I hate it, just found it to be another normal action flick.#0
1404_3#Arthur Askeys great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. His juvenile jokes, silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world. A lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him, and he was never completely comfortable in films. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has been tailored to make the most of his talents, but Askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated. Askeys support in the film is not strong, it includes regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a dopey honeymoon couple; Linden Travers going over the top as a mad woman. Also on board are Peter Murray-Hill, who off-screen married Phyllis Calvert, as the nominal leading man, giving a totally bland reading of the part, and leading lady Carol Lynne, who turns in an equally insipid performance. It is left to character actress Kathleen Harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on Dr Morland Grahams brandy.#0
11044_1#Shown in Australia as Hydrosphere, this incredibly bad movie is SO bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end, just to see if it could get any worse and it does! The storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class, the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures, and the acting is wooden. Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame. He obviously needed the money!#0
3771_10#1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time TERMINATOR 2 JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TEDS BOGUS JOURNEY. Out of the two, Ive always liked BILL & TEDS BOGUS JOURNEY a bit better. TERMINATOR 2 JUDGMENT DAY is the better made, but theres just nothing like Bill and Ted. Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, its hard to think of a greater comedic duo than Bill and Ted. They are one of a kind. What makes BOGUS JOURNEY one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original, it is just as fun. It doesnt change the characters like most sequels do. Bill and Ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film. This is because it was written by the original writers. Most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one, but since BOGUS JOURNEY had the same screenwriters, it ended up being just as good as EXCELLENT ADVENTURE if not even better. Just like the first one, BOGUS JOURNEY is absolutely hilarious, well written, fun, and above all, original. Its filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves, and William Sadler. Its an unforgettable journey. 10/10#1
3789_8#Bravo to Czechs, their once-powerful movie industry seems to awaken from post-Communist slumber. Conclusion dont miss this one! Its got a lot to offer.#1
5119_10#I just have to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times Ive seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after hes all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilleys, I was in awe. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a perfect performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If youre not a country music person, which I wasnt, this is 1 soundtrack thatll have you singing right along with every word. If you get a chance, please see this movie-it wont disappoint.#1
2972_7#I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of its release and had it come out today it would be a hit. Dont bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come. Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.#1
8011_1#I really must have caught a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so mortified by the dialoge that (Im not even kidding)half walked out. Shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming-of-age story, the film utilizes David Lynch inspired visuals with Fassbinder inspired acting. The performances in this film are so dull and bored that I figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script. Whats worse is that its colored like an episode of Miami Vice. I dont know who this director thinks he is; maybe he has pretensions of the surreal like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here. I could understand the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago, but when weve got masterpieces such as Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love why bother with this cinematic turd? There is nothing new to be seen here.#0

7105_9#An intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the Santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of Temuco. Waissbluths triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld, which raises so many social questions, more perhaps than the record-breakingly successful Sexo Con Amor, within a slick, smooth firecracker of a film, which place this film firmly alongside Sexo Con Amor, Taxi Para Tres, and El chacotero Sentimental, as cinematic evidence that Chile is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the post-transition period 15 years after the censorship of the Military Regime.#1
3192_1#What reviewers and MST3K left out is the best part (and only memorable scene) of this otherwise dreadful movie There is a very good rape-in-the-shower scene committed by the bad guy (Ben Gazzara look-alike) on Maria (as mentioned, killed later through T.J.s ineptitude). Perhaps rape is too strong a word,  prison mating ritual  may be more appropriate. The background behind this chance, yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding  Ben Gazzara,  introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool. The 30-ish blonde disses him, but our villain must be quite smitten by her, because the courtship is on at that point. His first move is to attempt drowning her, until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off. Kind of like the girl in high school you didnt like, but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway Lets just say, he catches UP with her in the cabana later.#0
3026_1#supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter. Id say 95 % is fabricated. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film, something i cant stand, and to top it off, the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b!ch I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head. its too incoherent, too flashy and way too boring, its a who gives a crap kinda story, and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writers own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brats life.#0
2615_2#I dont know why, but for some sick reason, I think since Ive been on the Disney sequel binge, I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first movie that was a remake of the Disney cartoon classic starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, it seemed like a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these movies dont work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults. This was not really that fun because its adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings, I understand theyre trying to make sure that its appealing to the kids, but its ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film. And 102 Dalmationss story isnt really that good. 2/10#0
2272_7#Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in Kurt Vonneguts dark tale. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during World War II. After the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to dig up his past. As with much of Vonneguts work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims. Nolte is fantastic - self assured and confident as the younger Campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)#1
9040_3#I do agree that though this story by Melville just might be unfilmable, this isnt even a credible try. To move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original storys intent and nature; possibly you might have been able to move it over to England, but it must be a period piece. Even our story narrator--the proprietor--tells it in a flashback, going back even further, somewhere around 1800. Towards the end of the 19th century, a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me an expletive deleted break  Even around 1800, such behavior didnt work very well, in view of the ending. And the movies ending? I dont know what it was, because I didnt watch the entire travesty--I had to stop. This was like setting  Streetcar Named Desire  in Elizabethan England.#0
8761_3#My girlfriend has the habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies no-one has ever heard anything about. Admittedly, at times, it has led to some fun discoveries. Often times, the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half. If you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they dont deserve, then this is the movie for you.#0
2681_7#As you probably already know, Jess Franco is one prolific guy. Hes made hundreds upon hundreds of films, many of which are crap. However, he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the assembly line exploitation.  Succubus  isnt his best work (thats either  The Diabolical Dr. Z  or  Vampyros Lesbos ), but it has many of his trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog. He combines the erotic (alternating between showing full-frontal nudity and leaving somethings left to the imagination) and the surreal seamlessly. This is a very dreamlike film, full of great atmosphere. I particularly liked the constant namedropping. Despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious, its amusing to hear all of Francos influences. Still, there are many users who dont like  Succubus  and I can see where theyre coming from. Its leisurely paced, but I can deal with that. More problematic is the incoherency. The script here was obviously rushed, and within five minutes into the film I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and it never really came together from that point on). Those who want some substance with their style, look elsewhere. Also, if its a horror film, it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful. Still, I was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that I didnt really mind these major flaws all too much. (7/10)#1
5653_10#This was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that I was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that I can see) to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination. I now understand from reading the comments it got CANCELLED thats just so unbelievable. What a bunch of headless overpaid suited turkeys there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that.#1
10402_1#Welltremors I, the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch. however, they proceeded to make tremors II and III. Trust me, those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one, i mean, ass blasters??? Now, only God himself is capable of answering the question  why in Gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie?  Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie, for it lives up to more than that. As i attempted to sit though it, i noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they were from the wild west would make the movie (with the exact same occurrences) any better? honestly, i would never suggest buying this movie, i mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.#0
4910_1#The word  1st  in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims. At least they dont have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise. In a word, dont waste your time with this one. My wife and I wish we didnt. But at least we created our own diversions by commenting in various places in the film like it was Mystery Science Theater.  Meanwhile, in Cleveland . . . .   #0
10665_2#About three minutes into this thing I started fast-forwarding, pausing only during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). In ten minutes I was done, and wishing I could get my money back from the rental store. The people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guys remote control! Thats the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insult to injury, the  twist  at the end was so formulaic, that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies. This movie is just a waste of time - Run away! Run away #0
8917_7#A meteorite falls in the country of a small town, bringing a jelly creature. An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and the youths Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor treats carefully the blister, and asks Steve to investigate the location where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the dwellers, but nobody believe on them, while the blob engulfs many people, getting bigger and bigger. Title (Brazil)  A Bolha  ( The Blob )#1
2395_7#Though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) just as we were getting tired of things like Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. An inside look at the staging of  The Scottish Play  as actors call  Macbeth  when producing it to avoid the curse, this is a crisp, efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe. With a wonderfully evocative score, and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying.#1
11124_1#I generally dont give worry much about violence in films, or a vast amount of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us. There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature, a good setting of characters, a good direction. This film could be voted for as a good film. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting. Well, well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself. But to use big pictures, artsy directions cruelty to living creatures, just to say men can be frightened of women, and men are cruel to women. Thats just not enough. I knew when I saw this film it would achieve good critics for the  philosophical, eastern and artistic  and whatever approach. But to me this film is just totally marred.#0
7207_7#I went into Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while thats something like what this film is; I also cant help but think that its just a poor mans Sleuth. The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot, but certainly its the case with the execution. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemarys Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his latest play bombs, Sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, arrives on his doorstep. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe, killing him, and then passing Deathtrap off as his own work. Despite all of its clever twists and turns; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element, and thats the characters. The film fails to provide a single likable character, and its very hard to care about the story when youre not rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by the acting. Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but nobody else does themselves proud. Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance. Its lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film. The plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others, but theres always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in its own right, and the cinematography fits the film well. Overall, I have to admit that I did enjoy this film; but it could have been much, much better.#1
3040_8#Gregory Pecks brilliant portrayal of Douglas MacArthur from the Battle of Corregidor in the Philippines at the start of the Pacific War largely through to his removal as UN Commander during the Korean War offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities. Certainly the most controversial American General of the Second World War (and possibly ever) MacArthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions. He claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace, yet he obviously glories in war; he consistently denies any political ambitions, yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate; he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter, yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the President of the United States; he shows great respect for other cultures (particularly in the Philippines and Japan) and yet is completely out of touch with his own country. All these things are held in balance throughout this movie, and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man, although one is left with no doubt that MacArthur sincerely and passionately loved his country, and especially the Army he devoted his life to. Pecks performance was, as I said, brilliant - to the point, actually, of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film (which is perhaps appropriate, given who he was portraying!) with the possible exception of Ed Flanders. I though he offered a compelling look at Harry Truman and his attitude to MacArthur sarcastic (repeatedly referring to MacArthur as  His Majesty, ) angry, frustrated and finally completely fed up with this General who simply wont respect his authority as President. Marj Dusay was also intriguing as MacArhurs wife Jean, devoted to her husband (whom she herself referred to as  General,  although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one.) I very much enjoyed this movie, although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about MacArthurs early life. I have always chuckled at MacArthurs reaction to Eisenhower being elected President ( Hell make a fine President - he was the best damn clerk I ever had  - which seems to sum up what MacArthur thought the role of the President should be, especially to his military commanders during wartime.) Well worth watching. 8/10#1
7269_7#Give this movie a break! Its worth at least a  7   That little girl is a good actor and shes cute, too. Jim Belushi is a comic genius. You cant help but feel good at the end! I wish there were more wholesome shows like this, that you can enjoy with your kids #1
11530_8#A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck. Mirage  is obviously inspired by Spielbergs  Duel  and Cravens  The Hills Have Eyes .Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.The films gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking.B.G.Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.Overall,if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10.#1
8770_2#This film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure It had 30 actors After JAANI DUSHMAN(2002) i guess no one had the guts to do something like that Amongst the huge cast Ajay Devgan stands tall, Saif is very good in his part and also its his first film with kareena, Abhishek is likable Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna does his part well rest are passable Rani is good, Esha is okay rest are passable#0
6161_1#This is possibly the worst fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot, characters are so weak that theyve got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose to maintain audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abrahams talents. Youre better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens its got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.#0
2173_10#It is often only after years pass that we can look back and see those stars who are truly stars. As that French film critic, whose name escapes me, said  There is no Garbo. There is no Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks ; and there is, thank heavens! Louise Brooks! This is the third of her European masterpieces. But it is also an exceptional film for being one, if not the, first French talkie, for following a script written by famed René Clair, for reportedly being finished (the direction, that is) by Georg Pabst, and for incorporating the voice of Edith Piaf before she was well known! So much talent working on and in a film, how couldnt it turn out to be a masterpiece?! And thats what this film is. Its a shame Louise Brooks was blackballed by Hollywood when she came back to the States--so much talent cast so arrogantly by the wayside! In the film, in addition to getting to watch Louise Brooks in action, its great to see pictures of Paris ca. 1930 and to hear Piafs young voice. I never get tired of this film #1
4474_10#This film (like Astaires ROYAL WEDDING - which was shown after it on Turner Classic Network last night) is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in Gene Kellys record Like Fred Astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a rooms walls and ceiling, this film had Gene Kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse. The sequence is nicely done. What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to Dean Stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day, and sets the stage for the sequence by having Stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background. Kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white  Pomeranian  navy uniform with blue stripes on it. Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene. He actually talks - a first that he did not repeat for many decades. He also finally puts Tom Cat into his proper place - Tom briefly appears as King Jerrys butler, trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses. Kelly, by the way, ends up with Grayson. Sinatras conscience at not being able to help her see Iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her (but not pulling Kelly into it, oddly enough) and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress (Pamela Britton) from his native Brooklyn. And naturally, without any assistance from Kelly, Sinatra and Britton fall in love. Ah, consistency   Thy name is not  screenwriting  necessarily #1
444_4#(SPOILERS IN THIS) #0
4843_3#Well I too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the Best Picture Oscar so I went to see it today. What a major disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the U.S. military who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are. They mirrored my own thoughts; as the movie played I - a complete civilian - kept thinking to myself,  say WHAT? theres no way that would happen like that..  2) Theres very little that actually happens in terms of plot. A new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed (a death that isnt really clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. THATS IT! 3) This movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed. If you want suspense try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie thats emotionally powerful, try renting Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONALLY in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work, and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over-hyped Apocalypse Now), or an old WWII black and white classic Sink The Bismark, which, especially for an English film, is unbelievably heart-wrenching. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON Hurt Locker.#0
10188_8#The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mothers love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script. The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja. All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to India. When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhars family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his fathers enemies. When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. Here starts the intense struggle which can be called  Nandini vs. Narasimha . The films biggest strength is the performances. Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini. Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance. One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha. He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. He is outstanding. Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from Indias most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief. Anyway, do watch Shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch.#1
2823_7#MGM were unsure of how to market Garbo when she first arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in  Torrent  justified that. She did not speak a word of English so she must have found it difficult to work, also Ricardo Cortez did not make it very easy for her. Highly Recommended.#1
8895_3#Superficically,  Brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package. Gene Kelly and Vincente Minnelli, the team behind  An American in Paris , are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations. Genes leading lady is Cyd Charisse, one of the best dancers of 40s/50s cinema, and unlike the generally superior  Its Always Fair Weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances. Lerner and Loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  My Fair Lady  and Minnellis musical masterpiece  Gigi ; Lerner and Minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  American in Paris.  At one point were assured that  everybodys looking for their own Brigadoon.  Suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us arent looking for this kind of quasi-queasy paradise. The premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing, but could work if the players were perfect. But Kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie, and Charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as Lucille Bremer was miscast in  Yolanda and the Thief.  Van Johnson does his best version of the classic Oscar Levant sidekick to Kelly (even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like Levant in  AIP ), and he provides a lot of amusing moments. But it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of MGM is a tossed-off Van Johnson performance.#0
2459_4#Obviously, I didnt care for Things to Come (aka  The Shape of Things to Come ) as much as most viewers. That means that there is a good chance that youll enjoy it more than I did. At any rate, you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view. Still, there are reasons to give Things to Come at least one viewing. If youre at all a sci-fi buff, this is a historically important film. Given Menzies background, the production and set designs are interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely dated. Its also interesting to see how Wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his  predictions . I particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon, which was strongly reminiscent of George Méliès 1902 A Trip to the Moon (aka Le Voyage dans la lune). Just dont expect too much from Things to Come.#0
8527_8#Allow me to just get to the bottom line here Ive got 3 kids, ages 5 to 10. I consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals. Ive seen most of the childrens videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film gets reversed in The Wizard of Oz, the over-18 sexual joke in El Dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I could probably storyboard Nemo from memory alone.  sigh #1
11055_1#I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities. Figure that out.#0
8470_8#A team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure  the Crown of the Queen of Sheeba. From Egypt, the crown is to be transferred via steamship to San Francisco. But it wont be an easy journey. There are plenty of would-be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown. Fortunately for all involved, Mr. Moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey. However, that doesnt mean someone wont try to get their hands on the treasure. As much as I hate that the Mr. Moto series had to end after this installment, its understandable when you think about it. WWII was just around the corner. And after Pearl Harbor, a movie with a Japanese hero wouldnt have gone over very well. At least the Mr. Moto series ended on a very positive note.#1
8678_4#After watching  The Bodyguard  last night, I felt compelled to write a review of it. Rating 4 out of 10#0
2939_10#Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably THE funniest. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy Ive ever seen and it is a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh  Ive watched this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still have side-splitting fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much - that you will miss half of them! Delirious is hilarious! Although there are a lot of funny comedians out there - after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them will seem like second-class citizens. If you have never seen it - get it, watch it - and you will love it  It will make you holler  -)#1
7800_1#Beyond dirt cheap, this shot-on-video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through. Its got the typical gore that youd expect in a zombie movie, but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while. Whats strange is that this is an amateur German video, and the version I saw is English-dubbed! The dubbers seem to be American fans (penpals of the Germans?!) who cant decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy. One character (a white German, of course) is dubbed by a black guy apparently, who speaks with thick ebonics! Kno wahm sayin, Comrad?#0
8269_1#This esteemed production has its fans. But to paraphrase the classic bad review of Mary Reilly, Moby Dick is like a painting, only slower. One appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie, but not the narrative. Only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work & various sea efforts; and the technology of whaling. And that doesnt call for a two-plus hour movie.#0
7019_7#Seven Pounds, this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the  Im going to make you cry  films. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? But nevertheless its still a good movie. I do have to admit it made me cry, but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson, I absolutely love this girl, ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton, I knew this girl was going to go far. Shes beautiful, charming, funny and talented, cant wait to see how much further her career is going to go. But her and Will Smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that wouldve made this into a great film. 7/10#1
5865_1#I cannot say enough bad things about this train wreck. It is one of the few movies Ive ever been tempted to walk out of. It was a bad premise to begin with, first pregnant male, but then they tried to make it a spoof. What were they spoofing all those real pregnant males??? This was the worst movie I have ever seen. If it had enough votes it would be on the IMDB bottom 100. If it was possible to give it a zero I would, and I would still feel I had given it too much credit.#0
11194_1#The coming attractions to  The Order  make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller, but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage. For heavens sake DONT SEE THIS MOVIE #0
1759_8#Im not quite sure if the term  serious comedy  applies to this movie, Im not even sure if this can be applied. On the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin. Therefore, I considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as  serious comedies . It also includes DVD bonuses which youll really see from top to bottom.#1
8467_7#I liked this movie because it basically did more with less. It could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more (though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop). While it was a shorter movie, it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story. Any more and it would have started to drag.#1
4326_7#I cant say how closely the film follows the novel, never having read the book, but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours its a good bet that most of the base are covered or, at least, we can say with some certainty that this isnt a Readers Digest condensed version. Maybe I should add that Ive just watched the first episode of the 2005 series -- and its better in two ways. There is more zip in the direction, so the pace is a little faster. And the business of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right up front, instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious  curse,  so the plot is easier to follow.#1
5314_10#i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year, and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite appealing. these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the right dialog and junk they made the movie a complete success. i enjoyed this movie more then others but i highly recommend releasing and watching this movie. it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality. capturing the essence of high school, high school record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters. i truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film, it helped me cry my eyes our in laughter.#1
10706_7#This is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching. The story is engaging and it doesnt take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin grabs your attention. The acting is first class and the characters are represented well. Sometimes it feels like the director couldnt decide himself between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chillers portrayal of the law abiding and shy Englishman with porn S.M. magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs! As does the look in Nicole Kidmans eyes when she is offering John his first taste of intimacy in a long time Other times the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant.#1
7297_10#I truly enjoyed this film. The acting was terrific as was the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized for. The only part of this flick I would change was the ending. The death of the creature was far too gruesome for the Sci Fi Channel. There were some interesting religious messages in this film. Jeff Combs obviously played a Messiah figure and the creature (or shark if you prefer) represented the anti-Chirst. There were some particularly frightening scenes that had that end of the world feel. I only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature. I know many people wont get the references to Christianity, but if you watch close youll get it.#1
3519_7#Alan Curtis has a loud, violent sounding argument with his wife, slams out of his apartment, has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar (run by Andrew Tombes, in a nice villainous part for a change), and returns to find his wife dead and the police, led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him. His attempts to prove his alibi - that he was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that he can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person. He ends up with no alibi, although his secretary (who secretly loves him) Ellen Raines believes him. Convicted after a trial, he is awaiting his death sentence. Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of his own. She also finds an ally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Will she clear Curtis in time? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great noir writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if he still has her jewelry. The mentalist may really be able to predict tragedy - or was he plotting the murder of his old partner, now an oil millionaire? Did a leopard kill the young women, or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge? Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor? Here it is Raines and Gomez (with an assist by Tone) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if he did see her, why is nobody else able to recall seeing her? The problem with the story really is Curtiss personality - he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit. In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed. However, in defense of Curtiss collapse, it also happens to other people in various films Gary Cooper, in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility. But Curtis just seems to give up. In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis didnt. But the film survives this weakness. The slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session. Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again. And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film. If it is not as great a film as DOUBLE INDEMNITY or THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE or THE MALTESE FALCON, it holds up pretty well until the moment Curtis and Raines are reunited at the end.#1
10540_10#I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination on display, the visual interpretation of the script, the humor is constantly surprising. The two leads are great and really carry the film. My advice would be to not even watch a trailer, just rent the film and watch without expectations. I rented from blockbuster, so it is readily available in brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and thats always good, unless its just that was stupid. I loved this film, you just dont get to see gems like this every day. This should become a cult favorite. Give it a try, you may just feel the same way about it as i do.#1
1700_4#In film, I feel as though it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on screen. This short from David Lynch tells a story but not much of one. I felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. It is good film-making but there really isnt anything else to it. As Ive said before, I am a huge David Lynch fan but I get frustrated by some of his work because I dont see a need for it at all. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know hes still got a ton of talent and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check this out but dont be surprised when you dont like it very much.#0
2619_8#If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King 3 Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead. Just like Tom Stoppards beguiling film, we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original Timon, the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a hat, and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence issues. By following their story - rather than Simbas - we get to see why all the animals bowed down as Simba was presented from Pride Rock. We find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to oust Scar. And we find out how they dealt with the hyenas once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but he is ably supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg reprising their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters Timons mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device which doesnt always help to progress the story. Having said that, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. With more laughs than any other third-in-a-Disney-series movie, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable.#1
12007_2#Its amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release. I mean.. look at the cast here , the promotion is superb, good enough songs and the trailers are fine. This makes it a house full on the first day, but its only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable. House full the first day , the movie is out the next week.  This film, inspired by Love Actually is what they say, didnt manage to handle the whole cast well. They tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one. The stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience cant connect with any single one of them. Its a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter Nikhil Advani after his big success of Kal Ho Na Ho.#0
5032_10#The movie  Frailty  is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film. It has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not.  Frailty  is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong. A very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you, do not watch it alone.#1
2235_1#I bought this movie and after I watched it I decided that I did not care for it. The acting was BAD. Was the principal a robot? He had no personality and his facial expression didnt change through the whole movie. At times the voices didnt match up. People talking and their lips didnt even move.#0
775_4#John Candy. Need we say more? He is the main reason you should see this film. Most people dont realize how gifted he was as an actor. Witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk. Just a simple(subtle) facial change and off we go. There are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits. The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when John(in a trance) goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend-that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. Im sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude. It is, but it is also very funny mainly because it is John Candy doing this bit. The story in general is pretty lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty(both SCTV alumni with Candy) are not given enough to do in the film. Levy has his moments, especially filming the wedding at the end(think Rod Serling) and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone. Overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid. I give this one 4 out of 10.#0
9431_10#and this IS a very disturbing film. I may be wrong, but this is the last film where I considered Burt Reynolds an actual actor, who transformed the role, and delivered a message. You will enjoy this film. It was filmed in the rural sections of South Georgia, which still exist. Just dont drive past that to Mobile, Alabama; That area still has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.#1
11408_7#Etienne Girardot is just a character actor--the sort of person people almost never would know by name. However, he once again plays the coroner--one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films that played his role more than once. Ive already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air. This film also is great to watch because in addition to Girardot, there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride--including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is quite an impressive cast, and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. Well worth seeing and exciting--though also quite impossible.#1
7477_9#This movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain. This movie was not the best the first time I watched it, but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It takes place in New York, and progresses on through his lifestyle. He discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination. This film was beyond my expectations, and is one of Cruises best films ever!#1
8618_1#Unbelievably awful film. I watched part of this on T.V. recently. My jaw dropped as I watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind-numbing drivel. Not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle. It was so bad it made me want to exhume Rodney Dangerfields body, slap him around and scream,  How could you?  I know many films are done in haste, hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. Its sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe. The bottom of the cesspool, even by Sunday afternoon television standards.#0
9512_8#This is a film that can make you want to see it again. I especially, liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming, but when Laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back again. Eight Stars for this one. Although it was released in 2002, I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.#1
1972_10#I dont understand your objections to this movie. It is a taut, thrilling extension of the character created in  Basic Instinct . The only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic, is the fact that Sharon Stones character is still alive and not in jail at this late date. I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of  2001, A Space Odyssey.  WHO CARES what is real? The blonde really is crazy, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. Whats important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. Get over it #1
9124_10#Bar some of the questionable acting (there musicians at the end of the day), this in the words of Quentin Tarrinno is  The best rock movie ever madeperiod  Prince provides a solid performance, as does Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent script, good direction, great plot, and spectacular performances. Not forgetting the some of the best rock/pop/funk music you will ever hear.#1
10912_3#I didnt really like this movie that much at all. It wasnt really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this, it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in. I mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but thats about it. The only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and Im not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found. All in all it was a couple notches below an average movie! Rental If you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not.#0
5590_8#(No need to recap the plot, since others have done so already.) Anyhow, Ive got to admit that I tuned in initially to see the gorgeous Hedy LaMarr in the buff. But now I have to admit that in the process I also got a lot more than just a peek-a-boo romp in the woods.#1
3112_7#I watched both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing this in the theater. Id been waiting for this since before they started filming. I wasnt disappointed. Bournes last line at the end  Look at this.. Look at what they make you give.  quoting the first assassin he killed, I loved that. The final scene was great. (Except that it was Vosen {Strathairn} that shot at Bourne. Why would he do that? Just out for vengeance? If he was angry enough to murder, why not shoot Pamela Landy after she faxes his top secret file? That didnt make sense.)#1
1278_9# The Last Big Thing  is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best #1
11849_4#A very young Ginger Rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter Lyle Talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from Poverty Row film maker Allied Productions. The movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house, or was it from a lovers apartment? Rogers actually has two identities at the films outset, that of Miss Terry, the dead victims secretary, along with her newspaper byline of Pat Morgan. Mistakenly phoning her story directly to Ted Rand (Talbot) instead of her papers rewrite desk, she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns hes been out scooped. Sorry, but for all those reviewers who found  A Shriek in the Night  to be a satisfying whodunit, I feel that any Charlie Chan film of the same era is a veritable  The Usual Suspects  by comparison. If you need a reason to see the film, it would be Ginger Rogers, but be advised, she doesnt dance.#0
1247_4#Not good! Rent or buy the original! Watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then.maybe. It is like claiming an Elvis actor is as good as the real King.#0
11587_10#I absolutely LOVE this movie and would really like to have it someday. Its just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace, I loved it and would like to see it again! I dont remember too much about it, but that a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family, and I dont remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister packs him some food and he goes. While hes out there, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was always fascinated with legends, particularly Native American legends and I would love to see this released someday to a DVD, PLEASE RELEASE IT, whoevers concerned!#1
9274_8#Another fantastic film from a country, where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes, has no problems in creating passionate subject matter. Panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing, non-professional cast. While still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country, he does so without the need of a heavy storyline. It is a positive take on a country, in particular its people, that the Iranian population desperately need. The greatest pity is it wont be released domestically. The insular, paranoid Iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up amid revolution and watching the academics, artists and educated disappear over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there. The realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event. The fact he shot it on 35mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence in only using non-professional actors also really works in this film. Fine performances all round. After watching many films showing the problems Iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government. This film does the opposite. It shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isnt too far away. Some call Panahi a feminist film maker but I think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in Iran. Young, independent women.#1
6373_2#Oh this was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is OK, but I think she acts bitchy through the movie, not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night, but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap. Faye Dunaway acts like she is remaking Mommy Dearest and the ending is completely silly. I really cant recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was intrigued a bit by the references to his work(Ravens, House of Usher-like family curse,and being buried alive)-still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film.#0
10518_9#Wrapped in gorgeous English country backgrounds, Emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways. Seeming shorter and more flowing than most Jane Austin adaptations, Emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment.#1
765_9#I guess when  Beat Street  made a national appearance,  Flashdance  came at the same time. The problem with  Flashdance  is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why  Beat Street  was better. The only movie that could rival  Beat Street  seems to be  Footloose , because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings. By the way, during the dance scene called Tango, Tango, I guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making a cameo appearance.#1
9923_2#As I write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture. Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including King Kong, The Wicker Man and practically every film that ever starred Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as Dough for the Do-Do proves. An entirely pointless colorized version of Bob Clampetts surreal masterpiece Porky in Wackyland, Dough for the Do-Do sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over Clampetts original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with Clampetts source material, although in truth no director could hope to come close to Clampetts inspired insanity. Inevitably, then, Dough for the Do-Do is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached. For cartoon fans like myself, its equivalent to a colorization of Casablanca.#0
8795_2#I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I did see was Quentin Tarantinos seeming insane obsession for it There were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality. Overall however, I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous. The hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks I found clumsy and dizzying, even sickening. Overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the U.S. military against various malcontents. I suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources.#0
9413_9#In my mind the best of the Ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time. The theme of workers v. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesnt stop  White Suit  from being a show stopping classic.  The Man in the White Suit  is 81 minutes of sheer brilliance, with a great plot, great cast, sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism. Absolutely top notch.#1
8686_8#The second official episode of the  Columbo  series ( Murder by the Book,  filmed later, hit the airwaves first). Robert Culp, who would match wits with Peter Falks detective in several future installments, is terrific as the short-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a clients wife when she refuses to cave-in to his blackmail schemes. The two stars are well-matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series.#1
12383_2#While some performances were good-Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau, and the two Italian girlfriends come to mind-the story was lame and derivative, the emphasis on the girlfriends racial background was handled clumsily at best, and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes, not as real people. I found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny. I can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in SF said this was a good movie, and wonder WHO posted the glowing review here on IMDb. Very disappointed in this movie, and mad I actually went to a theatre to see it, based on the faulty connection to Garden State, which is a far funnier, more inventive, and touching movie than this one. I must especially mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and by-the-numbers that I nearly left, and some in the audience actually DID. THAT was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard, which I saw coming 10 minutes before it happened. I really dont like being misled to spend my money so uselessly.#0
10907_1#I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, this dud seemed to last forever. Its one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of PG-13 while not being kid appropriate. The jokes arent just low-brow or f  t jokes, theyre crude, lewd, and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency. Many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the PG-13 ratingtoo badit might have made a bigger splash as an R-rated film if the funny was left in. (Overstatement? Probably.) I do not recommend this movie. It is a full-on waste of timeand Im a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot. At 45 minutes in, the movie felt like it should be winding downand boy were we ready for it to. The ending is quaint but doesnt salvage the rest of this quagmire/tourist trap of a rental. 1/2 star (glad I saw it as a freebiewould have been sickened to pay hard-earned greenbacks for this tripe)#0
8393_8#The Marriage of Maria Braun (MMB) is about a German girl (Maria) getting married to a German soldier (Herman Braun) just at the ending of the war. After being married for half a day and a night, Herman is send to the front again. To make ends meet, Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier. She got word that Herman died at the front, and things develop between her and the American soldier. Herman walks in on them, in bed, and after a confrontation between him and the American, Maria killed the American. Herman admits to the murder, ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him. The country is in shambles; one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette. There are food shortages. It is in short, a time of survival of the fittest.  There are different opinions about the end. After Karl died of a hart attack, Herman finally shows up. (Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison, to  become human again .) After the testament is delivered (made out to her and Herman in half), Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette, and blow her and Herman up. For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident. At the same time, she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true. She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore. She felt as if she had outlived herself.#1
11881_1#This movie is nothing like  Office Space  except in the premise. Office Space was hilarious. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, as I laughed not once during the entire film. Mr. Cornbluths self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to see this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone elses house so you can leave if necessary.#0
8620_8#I just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were blown away. I wont bother repeating what others have said. What the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The huge battle is exhausting. Afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didnt keep us from being completely involved and entertained. Seek this out. Its fun, its different and it takes you to places you wouldnt expect and thats very refreshing.#1
129_9#With stunning cinematography and a thread of Kafkaesque absurdity, this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene. The movie plays much like a dream, and I think that may be why people either hate it or love it. Characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless. But these are failings of the movie but conscious choices. The film works isnt trying to work as history, but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies.  I would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie, but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that I was completely swept away. This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever, and there is a wild imagination in its style. I can completely understand why people would hate it, but I give it 9/10.#1
810_10#This is probably the best of all of the Star Wars movies.  On the home movie version, I think Lucas himself wanted a different ending. In addition to the celebration on Endor, he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the Sith. The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the Death Stars destruction, balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies.#1
3484_4#I remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was horrible. Well, I didnt think it was that bad. It was amusing and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor concerning families around holiday time. Also, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriendss parents didnt even say anything about it. And the parts where doo-dah is hitting on his  supposed daughter.  FINAL VERDICT I thought its worth checking out if you catch it on cable.#0
11737_8#OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a good way though.It was stupid on purpose, and was one of the better  stupid  movies Ive seen. The jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine. Highly recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies.#1
7025_1#I wish I could give this movie a zero, or even lower, because sadly thats what it deserves. I honestly never walk out of a movie, but this one was so dreadfully awful that I couldnt stand another minute of it. Please,please, please- for the sake of mankind- skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into, this isnt it. I am a gay woman, who watched this film with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema. I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like Christian rock - it doesnt matter how atrocious it is, people will still flock to it, and champion it, no matter how poor the quality is. Please dont rent this  Instead, lets encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by renting  But Im a Cheerleader  or  Fire  or  Heavenly Creatures , instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community (i.e. Queer as Folk).#0
10534_1#Perhaps its because I am so in love with the William Holden - Kim Novak version, or because Im not a Gen-Xer, but this was absolutely the worst remake I have ever seen. Without the originals soundtrack, it just seemed like another typical TV movieyes, about as bland as Kraft cheese.#0
6754_8#Director Otto Preminger reunites with his Laura stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to rumble film noir Where The Sidewalk Ends. This film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, and clever dialogue and an eye-pleasing look with great camera movements and dark and gritty film noir lighting. Dana Andrews stars as Detective Mark Dixon, part mobster and part cop, who has a reputation of being too physically tough with criminals. After one case sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers, he gets far more involved than he wanted.  Dana Andrews is terrific in his role - tough and edgy, Andrews Dixon is ready to knock any and all off their heels if they get on his bad side. Hes the perfect film noir anti-hero - hes not very nice all the time, but we still root for him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role, as much as it is, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. There might not be too much to Tierneys role, but she certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role, knocking every member of the audience out with her kind smile, gentle manner, and twinkle in her eye. The supporting cast isnt too bad either - Karl Malden being the most memorable, stepping in and giving a good supporting performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Sidewalk Ends is no Laura, but it is a great film noir filled with great characters, story, and picture.#1
3616_2#If you merely look at the cover of this movie, its cool. DONT. The movie itself put me to sleep. It was slow paced, had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense. The acting was bottom feeder material and the plot, while it wouldve been cool for a different movie, was poorly shown here. They even kill the only likeable character in the whole film! I give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end. Other than that, you might want to save yourself from this movie trash.#0
6009_10#Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a college radical leftist. Mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot, and he flees all the way to the desert. He does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flies it himself.  The best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography, and special visual effects. The incredible, slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion, were a stroke of genius. Although not as ground-breaking a film as Easy Rider was, Zabriski Point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture. I recommend it, for those who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval, of the youth rebellion during the early 70s.#1
7844_10#I really love this show, its like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more. It gets you thinking about what is going to happen in the next episode, and the struggle of trying to maintain their friendship throughout the years. After each episode ends it leaves a sweet bitter taste in your mouth knowing that One - The show was good, you cant wait for the next episode and it really gets you thinking about what actually happens to the friends throughout the twenty years. And two - the fact that the show has been put  on hiatus  and we will not see the show finish in its entirety. Fox obviously do not know what they have done, they claim that they are losing viewers in the 18 - 49 category they clearly do not know what people want to see if they got rid of a good show such as  Reunion . I have one query though that I would like to raise. If they were to bring the show back and it went on for another season how would it work since each episode is done in the period of a year and the story is based on what happens in the span of twenty years? Your answers are most welcome. Bring back Reunion! Bring back Reunion #1
6214_4#What?!?? Why are people saying this is  mind blowing?  Just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world has ended! Not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed. 1 was right the whole time, if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened. People giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what? to make it rain? I admit the movie had its parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But a lot of it was clichés one after another. And did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like  Lord of The Rings?  Characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world; its pointless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies Ive ever seen, and thank god! How is robots turning against humans creative in any way! Its been done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go see a movie thats worth watching like Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglorious Basterds, those were good movies #0
10311_9#Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. In that case, it wasnt too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldnt be ignored. Im reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. The results were not very promising, so its nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example. Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection. It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained. This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie (which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy), its nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. Dont miss this one.#1
12317_10#A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story, it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology. The film has a simple premise a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt. Of course, it happens to be haunted as well. Think Evil Dead 2, if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix. This film is for real, despite being overlooked by many. Its absolutely among the best Ive ever seen. Its ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres, and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere, is nothing short of fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.#1
2331_10#At first I was weirded out that a TV shows main character could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought Id give it a shot. Guess what? I love  Pushing Daisies  and look forward to Wednesday nights just to watch it, then for the next week I watch it a few more times on my DVR. The colorful characters, witty banter, fast-paced dialogue, and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end. Ned and Chuck Charles relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact. Even Detective Emerson Cods character has continued to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She cracks me up! The narrators voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that I am watching a movie instead of a TV show. I have recommended my family and friends to turn on  Pushing Daisies  and they are hooked too  The show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen  P.D. , I highly recommend watching it #1
12206_2#I dont see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of  A Season in Hell , recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps, and return without engaging the enemy. The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless. It marches dully through its phantasmal ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. To speak is a sign of weakness.#0
8995_9#I couldnt find anyone to watch DiG! with me because no one I knew was a fan of either of the bands. Naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either The Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown Massacre, but this is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and/or pop culture in general. The way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take, and watching the public eat up and spit out the Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from Anton himself, since hes clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark to the bands ability to just remain. Definitely see this movie, even if you know nothing of either band. Its more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting. Its rare to follow a group so closely for so long.#1
923_9#I never saw it on TV but rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found that it was available. I had high expectations, and was not disappointed. Its funny, and the animation is excellent. That level of quality I would only have expected from feature films, so Im surprised at some of the bad comments on it. Maybe the DVD release had improved animation? One bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. Im an adult, and I really appreciate that it is for adults. It isnt only kids who like cute animated characters. It is nowhere near  raunchy  as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents wouldnt want their young children to see it. Im very disappointed that it was cancelled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or perhaps a movie.#1
5281_1#The humor in Whos Your Daddy is such poor taste that I actually closed my eyes in certain scenes. Close ups of semen are not funny! Nobody thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so gross and to hide their nervousness, they laugh. Watching Whos Your Daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling.#0
4488_1#I felt asleep, watching it  (and I had tickets for the midnight- premiere) Any questions? The most disturbing scene, as far as I can remember, was the techno-dance-i-dont-know-what-that-was-scene. By the way what an ending!?#0
5319_8#Forget that this is a  B  movie. Forget that it is in many ways outdated. Instead give writer-director Ida Lupino much deserved credit for addressing a subject which at the time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. To my knowledge, this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has upon its victims. Ms Lupino, obviously working on a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit through the streets and alleys leading to the rape, and the police lineup following it. And, she created a bittersweet ending which left me wondering if Ann really could ever have a normal life again.#1
7243_10#A brilliant Russian émigré devises the Stanislavsky system for winning at contract bridge - which makes him and his beautiful wife the GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America. The film takes advantage of the fad for contract bridge which had swept across the country since its development in the 1920s. It expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and makes no attempt to explain anything to the uninformed.#1
8407_7#this is, above all else, the typical Crown International Pictures drive-in (read  passion pit ) programmer. The 1975 Sammy Johns hit record  Chevy Van  is heard repeatedly on the soundtrack (this movie has even been reissued with the title CHEVY VAN), despite the films title vehicle being a Dodge. Danny DeVito makes only six minutes of on-screen appearance, but countless VHS reissues falsely credit him as the star of the flick. The movie is a comparatively sexist morality tale -- will Bobby find sexual satisfaction through the one-night-stand his customised van facilitates, or must he wait until Tina, the girl of his dreams, gives him the time of day? Still, it is representative of the prevailing carnal dream of male American high schoolers of the time, and on that basis alone THE VAN has, almost in spite of itself, become an artifact of the period that must be referenced in any honest retrospective of the periods popular American cinema#1
4487_1#As a fan of Science-fiction movies, I have been aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999. From the little bit I would allow people to tell me about it, I assumed it was highly original and sophisticated. I am also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland. I could never quite figure out how I missed The Matrix when it was released. With the imminent release of The Matrix Reloaded, it was time to buy the DVD and watch it. Just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see The Matrix franchise films Science fiction, martial arts, or soap opera? A bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them, nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each.#0
4189_8#Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie. He is a professional pickpocket. Hes been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark. Instead, it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953. The script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year.#1
3245_4#David Mamets film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking-mans movie, a movie that makes you question everybody and everything. I saw it for the first time recently and couldnt understand what was supposed to be so great about it. Ultimately, the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled. And if you, like me, predicted ahead of time that Margaret was going to be conned, you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying.#0
3411_9#This is easily a 9. Michel Serrault, known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career, does a stunning, even worryingly stunning job of impersonating Dr Petiot, a legendary French serial killer. The whole story (a real story which happened in 20th century France) is so powerful, so sinister - it makes for a very strong film that one remembers for a long, long time.#1
2866_1#No words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the BTK killer. Rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film. From start to finish, there was not one single highlight. The entire thing was horrendously put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-funny, for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together. This review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low-budget film, but this is not the case. Just thinking about the movie I have just seen makes my blood start to boil. How this film was ever granted rights for production i will NEVER know. I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it is truly a stand-out in regards to how pathetic, and disturbingly awful it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film-going, this is the WORST. MOVIE. EVER. I wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand, had I known what I was in for. ZERO out of TEN.#0
10808_10#I enjoyed every moment of this movie, even though I knew they could never really be together. With the life expectancy of a Bomber pilot being only six weeks, It made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940s who must have lived this story.#1
6715_10#I used to love watching  Sabrina, the Teenage Witch  Friday nights on ABCs TGIF. I think this was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I used to get together every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode. Overall I really miss this show. I hope one day ABC brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.#1
1806_4#Antonionis movies have aged not well. What always surprised me about them is that, besides an unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic  psychology  of the characters and situations. Remember, for instance, the conversations between Mastroianni and the  wicked capitalistic  that wants sing up him in  La notte , or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in  La aventura , or Ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film.  Sorry, today, half a century after the  revolution  of  La Aventura  we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except  Le amiche  and perhaps  Il grido ) are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces.#0
8105_8#SYNOPSIS The future as seen from 1939 England. As war loomed over Europe, the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past. It is up to the brave new world of science to overcome mans past mistakes. This is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark.#1
9510_8#In the winter of 1931, supposedly 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan Jr.) wonders what his mobster father Tom Hanks (Michael  Mike  Sullivan) does for a living. Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to  work  one evening, and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters. This leads - in a VERY roundabout way - to  Godfather -type Paul Newman (as John Rooney) hiring independent hit-man Jude Law (as Harlen Maguire) to track down Hoechlin and Hanks, who are off to cool their heels in Chicago. Hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is puzzling when you consider the characters line of work.

8565_7#If you like animal movies, this movie will please. My wife likes animals and animal movies, she especially like the parrot in this film. It is geared towards kids, but I laughed at most of the humor. The French fashion character made me laugh, and adds balance to the script. It is a Disney film, with its sappy, happily, family apeal, but I like leaving the theater with a positive fealing.#1
1266_1#If there is a hell, it contains a screening room in which GRAND CANYON is playing over and over again on an eternal loop. One would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help make up for the presences of Mary McDonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity) But, no. Apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from McDonnell. The entire affair is pretentious, overblown, insulting (if you are deaf or know anyone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is filled with obnoxious, self-involved people, but never gives us a reason to like/understand/sympathize with or even tolerate them. With rare exception, they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without. Theres no plot to speak of, no character development (these people wont EVER develop), no break-out performance and the most arch writing youll ever encounter in a film. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? Its title. This is one large HOLE of a movie.#0
10087_4#This is probably the first entry in the  Lance OLeary/Nurse Keat  detective series; in subsequent OLeary films, he was played by much younger actors than Guy Kibbee. A creepy film; worth seeing #0
5864_7#I did not like the pretentious and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite Vietnam War film is The Deer Hunter. The Deer Hunter focused on one part of the war, and then focused on the lives before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter. The story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the Deerhunter did. The Vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the Deerhunter. This is why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10. I also like the supporting cast. Everyone in the town is part of the movie. The town obviously cant handle Vietnam vets very well. Like many small towns, it is all about being quiet, humble, and minding ones business. Harris character, however, cant be any of these things. It is interesting how wars effect people. Some people rebound quickly, while others never really recover.#1
2831_7#I stumbled onto this movie when I was eBaying Caesars Palace stuff, as Im enamoured with its rich Vegas history as the last of the original luxury resorts still standing in good condition (unless you count Ballys, the original MGM Grand). In that respect, this movie delivers full-force. Youre given a grand tour of the Caesars property,which in spite of all the renovations and additions theyve done over the 40 years its been open, looks alarmingly similar. As a film overall, the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the horrendous editing. And when I say horrendous, Im not using that word lightly. Theres a lot of spliced-in, second-long snippets of Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where the Robert Drivas character is having a conversation with his father about how much hes grown up, and without any explanation, he (Drivas) goes (in those infamous snippets) from being himself, to a baby, to a little boy, and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father. (That doesnt give away any plot details; if anything, one can be prepared for it and maybe they wont be as flabbergasted as I was by the editing.) The film has aged well otherwise, and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that most guys could relate to in some form or fashion.#1
515_10#I remember the first time I saw this movie -- I was in the office working over the weekend & the TV was on for background noise. But I gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie Id never seen or heard of, until I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (the British title -- Stairway to Heaven in the US) is delightful, compelling, whimsical, & moving, all in one superbly-written, well-acted, perfectly-directed package. Its a classic that really does rank right up there with Casablanca, Its a Wonderful Life, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, & Chariots of Fire. WHY has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence? Fortunately, SOME knowledgeable critics HAVE put it on their  Top 100 of all time  lists. There IS hope -- 1940s Fantasia wasnt a hit til the 60s, & the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office, but made a hit by TV. Buy it -- rent it -- watch it -- demand it! You WONT be disappointed #1
6069_8#.Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream. I love watching him interact w/ Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or whomever--he clearly was having a ball and I think he made it easier on his guests as well--so long as they Knew ahead of time it wasnt a disciplined, 19 take kind of production. Relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there. Check this out if you are a fan or curious. He was a riot.#1
6126_1#For that matter one of the worst FILMS ever made. Plot goes as follows. Slog through jungle looking areas for 10 minutes or so. Have Bo go somewhere and strip. Slog through the jungle some more. Give Bo another excuse to strip. Back to the jungle. Oh look! Theres a Tarzan looking guy! Strip, Bo - strip. Kill the safari people. Tarzan looking guy has a fight scene. Saves Bo. Bo strips. Run credits. Run credits, run.#0
399_9#This movie is very cool. If youre a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy films, you should love this. This film is the Asian Lord of the rings A high fantasy story, based in actual Chinese mythology. (I realize many critics have called this film plot-less, I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, this one should be right up your alley. This film is still very difficult to find in the U.S., even though it was purchased for U.S. distribution along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Well worth the search  This DVD is also worthy of owning.#1
551_1#Ive been going through the AFIs list of the top 100 comedies, and I must say that this is truly one of the worst. Not just of the 90 movies on the list Ive seen, but of any movie Ive ever seen. Drunks are funny sometimes, Dudley isnt. Liza almost made it worthwhile, but alas just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny? I would highly recommend almost ANY other movie on the AFIs top 100 comedies for more laughs than this. If you want to see a funnier  drunk , try The Thin Man. Funnier movie in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if youre as drunk as Arthur).#0
11144_2#This flick reminded me of those lame  erotic thrillers  I used to stay up late and watch on Cinemax when I was 13. Id label this flick softer-core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder. There is, however, a ton of nudity- the opening scene is in a strip club, we see Kane Hodders keester (or at least a stunt butt) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the Munsters for a costume. 13 year old boys rejoice. Youd think itd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but, well they did. Want quality low-end werewolf-ism, go rent Dog soldiers want a ton of T&A this is your flick.#0
9046_1#Now for the truth, its very very weak storyline - for a Walt Disney film its total rubbish. When the robinson appear, the films all over the place, I was shocked how poor it was. It like  alice in wonderland  gone wrong!. It feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it - and they dont. After that, I sat there wishing for the end. My younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you dont care about the ending, you just want the film to finish. Its a film to forget, and forget quickly. If youve got some spare time, dont waste it on this.#0
2150_10#If you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales (the  Pretty Woman  variety love story), here is a beautiful film in which a Japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic, dispassionate life when he falls in lovewith dancing. Wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is at once deeply funny and poignantly moving.#1
5731_1#I watched the Unrated version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that I was never getting my time back. I persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would look realistic eventually, the special FX would actually look special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I am a complete gore hound. I number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world. This however was not made in the eighties, if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad. It wasnt so it hasnt got that defence. The dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines I was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture. I dont like Hostel, never have, I thought it was over rated, over hyped and I felt nothing for the protagonists, however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage. The back of the cover for Live Feed promised a twist you would never see coming, Im still waiting for the twist that was promised.#0
8077_1#I saw this movie a long time ago luckily it was for free. I have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I dont remember a whole bunch of it, but I do remember I was incredibly bored, the plot made no sense and when I came out of the theater the only thing I could say was at least now I know what the worst movie I ever saw was. I just was incredibly bothered by one thing if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive, why cant they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? How stupid do they think we are?#0
166_1#Okay first of all, I didnt sit down to watch the premier of a  Star Trek  Series to see a cowboy flying around in space. this is how a normal Enterprise episode works Any ways, just saying if Enterprise is on DONT WATCH IT #0
9556_10#When our local TV station first launched, it filled a lot of its schedule with old British programming.  Lock Up Your Daughters!  was duly aired, and I -- swayed by the opening few seconds of the film -- popped in a blank tape. Best thing I ever did. I showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece  a lost treasure,  as much for the cast as for the story. To this day I can crack up just thinking about the dialog. Should this gem ever find its way to a DVD release, Ill be at the front of the line.#1
9677_9#This movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids. The movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level. I watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny, entertaining,and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years. I watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining. This movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life. This movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.#1
7978_1#This film really disappointed me. The acting is atrocious. Unbelievable. And its about actors. The story is incredibly obvious A group of independent actors stage a Passion Play and, in turn, they start to live out the lives of the characters they play. Ive been watching a lot of movies lately, thanks to Netflix, and this is the first one I havent watched all the way through in a long time. I felt I didnt need to see the end; we all know the end of this story. Feel free to write me off as bored, jaded or just not interested. Feel free to watch this movie and see the Passion, in all its beauty, sadness and inspiration, delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade. Feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel. But dont say I didnt warn you.#0
502_10#Ok, so, this is coming a few weeks late, but it is here. Mostly, this is because of statements of various negative natures. Starting with the technology. When Star Trek TOS ran, special effect technology was extreamely low tec, and more than that, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups. In the 35 years seince TOS premiered, the crew of Star Trek have become experts at economy. Enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that weve seen in a while. This is what Voyager COULD have been. No series can evolve without a few inconsistancies, but be thankful that Star Trek has so few. So, quit gripping and enjoy.#1
160_2#I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of  Buffalo Bill,   Wild Bill Hickok,  and  Calamity Jane,  all of whom are in this story! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded great.  In a nutshell, his western shot blanks. Head up the pass and watch another oater because most of em were far better than this one.#0
1120_1#I saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go. This movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next. So if any of this is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far far far far far away from this one. My mind is still scarred.#0
3753_1#Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. Its pretty much crap, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as  terrible, just terrible.   Why the producers couldnt just wait to shoot something decent who knows. Im guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.#0
5248_3# Die Sieger  was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in Germany. I watched it last night and I must admit, that I am deeply disappointed. If that is supposed to be  the last best hope  for entertaining and challenging German action cinema, well then there is not much left. I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better, even with action films.#0

9901_2#This really should have been a one star, but there was so many, clichés, predictable twists, seen it all before slasher flick parallels that I actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laughalthough this was never the directors intention Im sure. Somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through, possibly for the hilarious voice of MR T, (not relay Mr T, but youll know what I mean if you bother to watch this), if you do watch it, make sure you dont pay to see it. This may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it, but Im sure youll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all#0
11178_7#MINOR SPOILER Underrated little Stephen King shocker. Its not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination--even if the limp performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, thered still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with. The old Micmac burial ground, Rachels terminally ill sister, and the Jacob-Marley-an Victor Pascow never really come together into anything coherent, and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed. But few horror movies really are perfect, and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock. `Pet Sematary may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of Zelda. Its politically incorrect, its tasteless, its gratuitous--and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way `safer horror movies never can. Add to that one of Fred Gwynnes best performances and Mary Lamberts witty direction, and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie--even with the hokey ending. Highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10.#1
2275_7#American playwright Howard W. Campbell, Jr. (played with a musty obsolescence by Nick Nolte) lives happily in Germany with his actress wife, Helga Noth (Sheryl Lee) before the beginning of World War II. At the peak of his life, Howard is drafted by an American agent (John Goodman) to become a spy on behalf of the Allies; forewarned of the risks the job holds, Howard has everything to lose, but finds the offer irresistible. Following the death of his wife and the end of the war, Campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in New York City, which muddies his neuroses even further. The central question (indeed, a question that has frustrated many critics) of the movie and Kurt Vonneguts source novel is,  is Campbell a hero or a traitor?  Director Keith Gordon and screenwriter Robert B. Weide offer us clues, but no answer, and this ambiguitythis NOT knowingis what keeps  Mother Night  fresh and interesting throughout. At the beginning of the film, Nolte portrays Campbell as intelligent and confident; by the end, hes either scared and uncertain, or scared and COMPLETELY certain of his contribution/debt to humanity for the role he played in the war. Gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the films first half, which complement his portrait of the Nazi bourgeoisie and captures Vonneguts dramatic side. On the flip side, when Campbell is confined to his lonely New York apartment (which he affectionately calls  purgatory ) only to be discovered by a group of Nazis, the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author, and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds. The moral (even spiritual) paradox  Mother Night  presents doesnt lend itself to simple resolution, and to a degree, should be left ambiguousthe black-and-white scenes of Campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in Israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toas Campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about; the war changes him, coming back to America changes him, and meeting up with the Nazis in New York compels him to prolong the facade of his  act  even further, to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall, spewing anti-Semitic bile. Perhaps thats the best reaction we could hope for.#1
6593_1#Even if it were remotely funny, this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful. Stopping just short of digging up the boys corpses and re-enacting Weekend At Bernies  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the frickin Ernest films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over Stan and Ollies legacy. Gailard Sartain does a fair Ollie impersonation but Bronson Pinchot wouldnt reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike contest; even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable. The less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better. Makes Utopia look like a dignified swan song.#0
987_4#You know all those letters to  Father Christmas  and  Jesus  that are sent every year? Well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. As bizarre settings go, its a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is  Dead Letter Office . Having said that, this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one. If it was Royal Mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. I havent been in this flat for two years and were still getting letters for a Mr Wang, some female priest of the Church of Latter Day Ive-Never-Heard-Of-You and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company. Despite that,  Dead Letter Office  is certainly something a little different. It might not be to everyones taste but I liked it. Yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, its nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity (no chance of that in an Australian film). There aint any major laughs, theres no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one-dimensional. But its the story that counts here and while its not earth-shattering in its magnificence, its a pleasant enough way of passing the time. Its the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldnt really miss it if it wasnt there.#0
9355_7#Time and time again, it seems that the comedic actors of Hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers first it was Robin Williams {One Hour Photo (2002)}, then it was Jim Carrey {Eternal Sunshine (2004) being one example}, then Will Ferrell {Stranger than Fiction (2006)} and now Adam Sandler. Yes, thats absolutely right the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless, goofball comedies {Im not complaining; Ive always been a fan} has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud. Of course, some readers may be wondering whatever happened to Punch-Drunk Love (2002), but I can only assure you that its a film Im currently taking measures to see as soon as possible, since Ive heard its terrific. My first film from director Mike Binder, Reign Over Me, is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship. Though it does occasionally stray into all-too-familiar territory, the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving, with both Sandler and Don Cheadle giving memorable performances. Initially, it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the September 11 attacks as a storytelling device. Afterall, wouldnt it be just as devastating if Charlies family had died in an ordinary, everyday car accident? However, if you consider that the directors intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy, then Reign Over Me does a very good job. Its easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks; this is the first 9/11-orientated film Ive seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who werent even involved, whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved. Adam Sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role, one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task. Snapping instantly between cheerfulness, anger and depression, Charlie Fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise, a hollow soul who, thanks to the companionship of an old friend, can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark, bleak tunnel.#1
10233_7#I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectationsuntil now! BURNING PARADISE doesnt contain the flat humor most HK movies have, nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some  intelligent  space (the only truely intelligent martial arts film I have seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved it is no true HK movie for me). There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one(which is one of the coolest I have ever seen, yet so short) to the last main scenes! But mind, theres also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, decapitated, etc). The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical (notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall!). Yep, its not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film, its Ringo Lam! And Im sure as hell going to check out more from this director! Ace.#1
9378_9#Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The Hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself. And small town America does not seem all that safer than the Big City. Like its predecessor mentioned above, this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable, but all lead to the cathartic self discovery.#1
6900_1#I just sat in the theater bored as hell, i wanted to leave halfway through the movie. The plot is simple 4 Samoan guys wreck weddings. So They have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding. Yawn. Avoid.#0
6362_7#Granted I had seen some  Speed Racer , but I never really watched it and I had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the Phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five. This one though I watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it. It actually ended, the bad guys done in unlike nearly every American cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one Transformers that ended with Galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids never making it home, with GI Joe with Cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth. This one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. As it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one Android 16 used against Cell in Dragonball Z, then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out. Then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. He would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called Bobo in America. The villains not only consisted of Dr. Hell, but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head. Interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion.#1
5756_3#This should be a great film Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers. Mike Nichols directing. Uh uh. Its dull dull dull! Pointless and predictable! Slow and unfocused! Its a cookie cutter boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has affair, girl leaves boy story. Now theres an original concept! After squirming through two hours (was it only two? It felt like six.)I wasnt sure whether it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. It was done in 1986. Im sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget. I hope the damage to the reputations of Streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade. Its not that its such a bad picture. Its just that its such an un-good one.#0
12413_3#Im not going to say that this movie is horrible, because I have seen worse, but its not even halfway decent.  As a whole, this movie is confusing. Characters are ill-developed, Georgias acting is wooden and stiff, Sadies character is yanked from one bad situation to another, with no back story or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain.#0
9681_9#Add Paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal characters. This movie is a love story - bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and beloved Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after Maries parents sell him to a pawn shop. Before the heart warming ending we learn all the misadventures of Paulie. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are marvelous. Beautiful photography throughout. Great little movie, word of mouth will make it a cult favorite.#1
229_1#Caught this on IFC yesterday, and cant believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these  ladies  were anything but? Kate tells Jed she could get fired because shes supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for him! Then they suddenly decide theyre in love? And shes SO devastated over his death, she doesnt go to his funeral, much less, tell his family the  good news   By the way, how did an American get to be the headmistress of a very proper British school? Janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning! And the less said about Molly, the better! As for the guilt Janine and Molly feel over Jed, please! Its the punks own damn fault he got turned into roadkill! Wheres the guilt over poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If only I could do the same to the bozos behind this  movie  #0

1565_7#Ive just seen The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it quite good. This was George Sanderss first appearance as the Saint, where he replaces Louis Hayward. Rating 3 stars out of 5.#1
909_8#I liked this movies. Its a another Yash raj film which you know will look good on screen, all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice Another rule of Yash rajs film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent. Think back to all of those films.. MPK Suman didnt have mom, HMAPK Salman didnt have parents, AND FINAL rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nath crying Overall a very good looking film. No big plots or twists but a very gentle film, very much like Bollywood classic.#1

4961_2#And thats about all that is. This thing is slow. The actors have ability, they just dont seem motivated to put forth the effort. The plot isnt that great and is hampered further by the aforementioned slowness of it all. The accents, when there are any, are British. Uh, lots of these folks are supposed to be Danes. OK, OK, accents arent that important. But language is. I dont think they used words like  yeah  and  OK  in Beowulfs day. And that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him? Did he ever reload that thing? Did he ever sight it in? Or was Beowulf just that bad an aim? Well, his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in generating the monsters. Those were rather off too. Bad special effects. Bright spot? Just one that I can think of. Marina Sirtis has held up well over the years.#0
3368_1#For movie fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jacksons  The Haunting of Hill House ) and have never seen the 1963 Robert Wise production with Julie Harris, this remake will seem pretty darn bad. For readers of the book, the from 1963 follows the it much closer.#0
11614_3#The Lady in Cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60s. The writing, not the acting, is at center stage. Did I say - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are female or gay. Broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day (camp- wise). Most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors. The action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers. Amazing to note they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. The musical score, wait . . . was there a score? Well, you get the point. Watch it with friends who want a good laugh. its full of them.#0
7386_7#OK, so the Oscars seem to get hyped just a little more each year. And I was rooting for  Gosford Park  to win (come on, Robert Altman had deserved an Oscar for years!). That said, I guess that it was high time for an African-American to win Best Actress. Contrary to the previous reviewer, Halle Berrys role in  Monsters Ball  was far more original than Nicole Kidmans in  Moulin Rouge ; I never would have thought to nominate the latter for anything, especially in a year that saw  Mulholland Dr. . So, although I wouldnt have given  A Beautiful Mind  Best Picture,  The 74th Annual Academy Awards  still pleased me (I have to admit, I enjoy the Oscars more than my own birthday). And the day after, as my parents and I were hiking around the dwellings in Bandalier, New Mexico - it was spring break - I was thinking to myself that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, that most people watching were asking  Jim who?!  I wonder whether or not Woody Allen will ever attend the Oscars again.#1
185_9#I finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of  Show People . I cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters, plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words. Seeing the cameo, out-of-character appearances of so many M-G-M silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself. I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees Marion Davies but it is something to the effect of  I dont think I like her!  Pop the corn, pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history. Enjoy #1
10780_10#Far by my most second favourite cartoon Spielberg did, after Animaniacs. Even if the ratings were low, so what, I still enjoyed it and loved it, was so funny and I adored the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just fantastic, the whole cast were brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. Id love to see this cartoon again, was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant. Also I can remember the hilarious moment where Brain cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental, that was just fantastic, I love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back, i loved them#1
9632_8#The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual. 8/10#1
6951_10#I was never a big fan of television until I watched 24 for the first time. I got into the series very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode. It was an episode of Series 3 that was on my parents DVR (digital video recorder) box while I was house sitting for the weekend. It took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of Jack Bauer. And boy was I hooked  I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money Ive ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. Thats 72 forty minute episodes  I will say that finding out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting an entire week. I can only imagine the anticipation of watching Season 6 week to week  I find it mildly torturous and cruel but Im going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of America  The DVR is set and you can bet Ill be chomping at the bit #1
9745_7#As someone else commented, this is a feel-good movie. Its got glorious scenery and the wonder-filled voice of Luciano! Ive seen this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon. Id forgotten how much I miss Pavarottis singing of Nessun Dorma and I need to get out the CD! Its a great movie to just while away the afternoon engrossed in fun and reverie. Eddie Albert is grand as the agent and a bit over the top, but all agents are just that anyway. The Italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view. If you need acting of Olivier proportion, this movie isnt for you. If you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music, watch this film. Just enjoy!#1
7635_1#I totally agree with the review by a reviewer of Variety that the film is never quite as funny, lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant. Narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic. If the film is supposed to be character-driven the poor lighting doesnt enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty in following the spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched the film at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. Unfortunately Bunny Chow wont be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history. Not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. It has clearly limited appeal among South African audiences.#0
5467_9#In my opinion this has to be one of Barbara Stanwycks best performances. She was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue. And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie, with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy. Her only link to anything is her good friend, Chico, played wonderfully by Theresa Harris. Though Chico is African American (and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie), and Lily is not, they have a special bond. And it is not sexual. Just 2 women stuck, or shoved, into a situation beyond their control. After Lilys father dies, and she does not know what she will do, she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants. Yes, its immoral, but thats the entire point of this movie. Then  they  had to go and ruin the last few minutes. So, up until the last few minutes of the movie, its a superb film and worth watching. The  lesson  of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then, and Im sure will be a 100 years from now. Women, its awful what Lily does in order to get what she wants, but it works. Men, take note.#1
10529_10#By no means my favourite Austen novel, and Paltrow is by no means my favourite actress, but I found the film almost totally delightful. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays Miss Bates are all absolutely terrific. The period detail is not alienating; the feel of the movie is just right, in fact. But the real find is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley. There could not be more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr K in the novel, but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film. Northams good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment, either! Highly recommended. AnaR#1

9505_10#This is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film  Ripsteins locations are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinarily García Márquez, no doubt about it. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife. You must see it #1
4141_10#This movie is not only the funniest film ever created, its the greatest. My hats off to Mr. and Mrs. Zodsworth and the rest of the wacky, wacky cast. Good morning Satan, Want a donut? See it post haste! GO SEE IT NOW!#1
8891_10#I can agree with other comments that there wasnt an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasnt a documentary! It was meant to entertain and I think it did a very good job at it. Despite it wasnt a re-enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade. I found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch.#1
10388_4#From reading all of the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but I didnt think it was THAT bad. Ive seen much worse, actually. To sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story. Dont go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on TV you can give it a shot. 4/10.#0

9660_4#When this movie was first shown on television I had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about World War I as experienced by American soldiers. Unfortunately this is not it. Okay, so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown. But it is still disappointing. But what really turned me off to this flick was the typical anti-war anti-military angle that movie makers seem to think is important. True, war is hell. But most American soldiers, even though they grumble and gripe, tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather gung-ho about it. My Grandfather served in World War I. And even though he died four years before I was born I have been told how proud he was of his service.#0
8695_9#A long time ago, I watched this movie from the middle on cable. I then had a crush on Mary Moronov. I saw her again in Eating Raoul. I was convinced that shes the hottest woman on screen. Thiss the only movie I own on original tape.#1
10332_8#Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) stands trial for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses give evidence - Father Warecki (Henry Travers), Wilhelms brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Wilhelms former lover Marja (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense. The film ends after the court sums up. Throughout the film, Knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest. This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.#1
10173_1#No wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie. Its just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch. Bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a Disneyland attraction. Students fist-fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue. The Watts riots with a cast ofugh10?? Dermot Mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a Mary Hartman look-alike with the most annoying smile since Mr. Sardonicus. Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift. Drunken virgin Rick Schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service. Silly, giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of Shindig, sing horribly off key, and actually make it big in the music business. And who wrote this compelling dialog?  Im going to Burkley and wear flowers in my hair . I think I found someone to buy Sticks woody! . These people are animals    These people are my family  as the Shirelles sing  Mama Said . Oh brother, What a mess. This is like a Reefer Madness of the 60s except its not even funny.#0
2646_10#I think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie, at least thats my opinion. I am not sure its a movie about drug abuse; rather its a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, its not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that, he definitely failed, as most people think its one of the many drug related movies. I, however, think something else is the case. As in many movies portraying different cultures, audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture, i.e. something theyve grown up with and are quite familiar with. This movie is to show what those  genius  people very often think and what problems they face. The reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds ) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis. They start a fairly hard job and excel in no time. They feel like- I went to work, did nothing, still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects, what should I do now with my free time. And whats even more boring? When you can start predicting behavior not because youre psychologist, but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past. So, for them, from one side its a non challenging job, which is also fairly boring sometimes, and from another they start to figure out peoples behavior. Its a recipe for big big boredom. And the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state. They guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic (math describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, is actually absolutely right.#1
11624_8#Red Eye, a movie that id had wanted to see for awhileCillian Murphy plays Jack Ripner (jack the ripper) a managerial pose to Assassins, and his literally killer plan to knock off a highly profiled man and his family. a must see for thriller fans no sexual, but there is a slight hint (the bathroom scene) (jack)  Thanks for the quicky  and the (female attendant)  Ohhhits gonna be ONE of those flights  (second female attendant)  Hey! this isnt a motel  you get the idea#1
11572_1#Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein Company did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming himself, and quit producing. There is no way you can watch this and enjoy. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature. I am so sorry I rented this movie. I will never watch anything with the name Spurlock on it. It is completely garbage. Filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal. The film states that the American Consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products, making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy.#0
6590_9#Intelligent, wry, and thrilling,  The Invisible Man  stood out in 2000 among Sci-Fis usual lineup, balancing out  Farscape  s fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty, cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. The show sat between  Law and Order  and  Doctor Who  on the believability meter, but there was no denying the fact that  I-Man  s characters went beyond caricature. Even characters that verged on predictability like the Keeper, the Official, and Eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly, made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. The shows low points are still entertaining, and Ive never seen such taut pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be commended, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I come across a marathon of  Hercules The Legendary Journeys  on Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sigh, mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that  Invisible Man  and its ilk represented.#1
11594_4#Like Freddys Revenge, this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesnt go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. This has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor, so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy.   Ive not alot to say about this. Its moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four, but not worth watching a movie over. Uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series.#0
1378_9#I saw this little Belgian gem two days after seeing American Teen. Make no mistake about it, adolescence is a roller coaster ride, be it American or European. Naissance des Pieuvres (or as it is being called in the U.S. Water Lillies)is a tale of a young 15 year old girl (played by Pauline Acquart,who at times resembles a young Scarlett Johansson)acts the cool, withdrawn girl who wants to be on the school swim team, just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). Its more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriane. Figuring among all of this is Maries rather plump, unattractive friend, Anne, who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age. Along the way,we are shown the usual array of teen pastimes (broken hearts,shop lifting,alcohol and/or drug use,casual sex,etc.). This is a quiet little film that takes time to work its way into your system (Michael Bay fans,take notethe pacing here is s-l-o-w,so steer clear),but if you have no problem with this, Water Lillies is a charmer. No rating here,but would pull down a hard  R , due to language,nudity,adult situations.#1
2396_1#Just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit, I was a bit surprised it was even on. There were so many goofs, mess-ups, and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch. The acting was OK, but please, you can really feel the  Straight to Video  feeling. The cast/crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it. Trust me, you wouldnt even tell the difference.#0
10873_4#Many people thought that this is a good movie but I dont agree with them. At the beginning of the movie, a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship, then hey killed some people on the earth, but for no reason. Also, it is in a dark forest, I cant see anything on the screen, I can only hardly hear the sound. In conclusion, I dont think this is a good movie.#0
2189_2#This movie tells the tender tale of a demented scientist who, after his fiance is decapitated, goes around ogling strippers so that he can find a suitable body to attach her noggin to. Everyone in this movie exudes more slime than a snail, particularly our protagonist.#0
9447_8#Engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), obnoxious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and nice guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minute are great--theres the incredible dueling banjos sequence, interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobbyand the trip becomes a nightmare. A powerful film--NOT for children. Try to see an uncut version--the TV version is butchered. Also letter-boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images.#1
4869_10#Not for people without swift mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If You dont have any of these You can not understand it. And if you dont understand, you cant enjoy it. ) For example if you think Picasso is a name of a car produced by Citroen, probably if you see a Picassos painting you just will walk by it, deciding that its a trash-work of some street painter. ) So do not judge, before trying to understand it ) In the end i think its a MUST for every one with open minds. Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be put in frames. Because there are things in this world, that any frame just wont fit.#1
6002_7#This film had my heart pounding. The acting was great, the erotic music and the beautiful women add up to make this one a winner. The lead actress decides to join an escort service when she realizes that her husband has no time for her. She steps into a whole new world her first client being another woman. This is a film you definitely DONT want to pass up.#1
7492_7#Though not a horror film in the traditional sense, this creepy little film delivers the goods. It seems a vampire is loose in a small German town draining its victims of their blood. Police Inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok. The only one who believes him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray) the inspectors girlfriend and lab assistant to Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory. The townspeople suspect the weirdo Herman Gleib, played with his usual frenzy by Dwight Frye who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role. The film contains quite a bit of humor which helps relieve some of the intensity involved with all the murders being committed. One funny part has Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Ruth Bertins aunt, thinking weird Herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team. This budget movie brings in elements from  The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari  with Dr. Niemann using the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist carry out his orders, from  Frankenstein  by using the human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and  Dracula  since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker. Thses elements are mixed well by director Frank R. Strayer with a little comedy thrown in for good measure. The concoction works. The restored version I viewed used tinting to increase the spooky atmosphere. So try to see the this version if possible.#1
3276_8#49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller/horror, 1988) Sick in bed with a fever 11-year old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to keep her company. Her health progressively worsens as a series of mysterious black outs grip her. In each of these episodes she dreams of a house in a desolate field, with only a sickly-invalid boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) inhabiting it. When a dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic  paperhouse , the life of Marc is put in jeopardy. Her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health. Rose would follow this film with  Candyman  (1992), a true thinking persons horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite.#1
2528_10#So many consider The Black Cat as the best Karloff/Lugosi collaboration. I disagree. The Invisible Ray is their best. A great storyline, fantastic special effects, and classic Karloff over-acting. I love it #1
3029_8#The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what Greene wrote; for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the murdered-child obsession that takes over some of the plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to the ludicrous. Its a dreadful shame that the films not available on DVD.#1
7950_9#First of all, I loved Bruce Broughtons music score, very lyrical, and this alone added to the films charm. The best aspect of the movie were the three animals, superlatively voiced by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. Whereas Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character(the voice of reason), and Field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling Chance off. The humans werent as engaging, and sometimes the film dragged, but that is my only complaint. This is one beautiful-looking film, with beautiful close up shots of Canada, I believe. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously dull moment, and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script. All in all, a charming and perhaps underrated film, with a 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox.#1
5808_4#Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a mercurial, hot-tempered, high-powered Hollywood couple they filmed this (nearly) scene-for-scene remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action-thriller about a fugitive twosome. It almost worked the first time because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen--even stone silent and weary, you could sense his clock ticking, his cagey magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueens league, but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor--if so, this is not a showcase for his attributes. Basinger does well and certainly looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob-magnet role. A sub-plot involving another couple taken hostage by Baldwins ex-partner was unbearable in the 72 film and plays even worse here. As for the action scenes, theyre pretty old hat, which causes one to wonder why even remake the original?    from     #0
6431_1#This movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a TV movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays Senator McCarthy. Its just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry. The marxist-leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist nut jobs, Ronald Reagan took over where McCarthy left off and they couldnt stop him, thus the end of the Soviet Union and its cohorts. It will also help if you read about what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm#0

2796_2#for the most part, On Demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies, and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen, and already have an opinion on. It was either this, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies), which I havent seen, and I was actually in a movie watching mood, which doesnt happen often anymore because Ive already watched all the movies i own a million times, and thats a lot of movies, and I dont have much interest in new movies, and boy, this movie made me regret it. Im not going to put in any spoilers, Im just going to tell you that only a FEW of the very FEW actors in this movie ,are half way decent. I think the main girl, the dead one who kills everyone, is very annoying looking, but convincing; Id take her for psycho bitch anyday, so she fits her roll well, though it is lame. The blood isnt that great, only a few of the kills, or may I say  woundings  are alright, but you dont see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing. Towards the end of the movie I was begging my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a band member, the recording parts werent very interesting either, though what happened would truly happen when going about recording. Im done, if you want to watch this, suit yourself.#0
752_1#Is it possible to give a movie NO STARS? I suppose not. However many stars IMDb displays this just think zero and youll get my drift. Director and photographer Timothy Hines didnt have much of a budget compared to Spielbergs Herculean effort with the same material (rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made), but that need not be an insurmountable handicap. Ive seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring ( Soldier and Saints  is a recent example). With hard work, integrity and, above all, talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of Wells novella -- and at fraction of what was spent by Dreamworks on its  War of the Worlds . Unfortunately, Hines failed in all these departments. Even if he had had Spielbergs budget and Tom Cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal hes foisted on us. Next we have acting, or more precisely too much acting. Whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out. Evidently Hines thinks hes getting a bargain -- More fleeing in terror over there! You, quaking behind that tree, lets have a real conniption fit this take. You call that writhing in agony? Nonsense, my grandmother can writhe better -- Nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink. They arent even good amateurs. But this neednt prove fatal. Many a good movie has been made with rancid acting. Thats what directors are for. And editors. Which brings up another point Who the hell let Tim Hines edit this cheese factory? If Americas butchers were as adept at meat cutting as Hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef. In spite of the near three-hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie -- not sequences, but single frames, creating a herky-jerky effect thats nauseating to watch. Maybe Hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890s. If he was I can say he doesnt know how to do it.#0
3289_10#I do miss the company Vestron, they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s. This is very apparent with the astonishing Paperhouse, a film that touches me deeply each and every time I watch it. While there are many films I adore, there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me films like Paperhouse, Static, Resurrection, and Donnie Darko. When I see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins, all I have to do is watch Paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed.#1
9858_7#I wouldnt go so far as to not recommend this movie, since the only problems I have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems. That doesnt make it bad, just not something Id go far. And of course, visually it wont disappoint, but thats almost a given with Pixar flicks. Of all of their stuff, Id put this at the bottombut that isnt in itself bad.#1
11136_10# Midnight Cowboy  is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America. Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success when initially released. But be warned, its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. The characters are memorable, well-developed, and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending, something which was basically mandatory by the 80s. Still, this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film. Its a time when well-made, innovative, and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this was over by the time  Star Wars  was released. The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects,  Midnight Cowboy  has aged quite well. Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released. The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece. The characters backgrounds are never fully explained, but the performances make them completely developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Plus, being a fan of vintage exploitation films, I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street.  Midnight Cowboy  is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made.

145_10#Sequel to  The Kingdom  is bloodier and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldnt sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoothis has it all! If you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you. Sadly, there probably wont be a  Kingdom 3 --Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after this was filmed. But you never know #1
4625_2#How could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10? How could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher? Who is voting here? I can only assume it is primarily kids -- very young kids. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid; the acting is hard to even think of as acting; the characters are characterless; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this one rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast, I suggest you read a book instead.#0
9362_1#The plot sounded like it had promise. To be honest I did not watch the entire movie. After about an hour into the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant. It was because the movie was badly written, acting lacked emotion and I did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. When he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying  If you cant run with the big dogs dont leave the porch  kept running through my bored mind. Save yourself the time and skip this movie. I can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as I did wondering why anyone waste money, time, energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to American cinema.#0
5294_8# Pecker  proves that Waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age. A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget of Waters films has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that  trailer-park  touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a quite life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the always watchable Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worst. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. It is not among his best films, but there are some big belly laughs here ( Memama  has the best lines in the film!). It is consistently clever and funny, and has that very  queer  sensibility that I have come to love in Warters movies.#1
9410_7#I enjoyed this film. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. It was amusing at times, but really, it wasnt very funny at all. If Id been expecting it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, I found it to be enjoyable and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man whos less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. Hes absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; me, I compare it to The Fountainhead.#1
5176_1#When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was expecting out of the norm, cut out your heart violence. I know that good movies dont always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this god awful movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I am expecting horror, not Dawsons Creek with incestuous undertones. My expectations were extremely low for this film, yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger. There were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. I regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the Hamiltons!#0

5216_8#Erroll works for The Department of Public Safety and his job is to check up on sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex offenders. I dont blame him but his boss is ready for him to retire so along comes Allison. Erroll is now training her to do his job and its like job shadowing. Allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she doesnt realize how much danger she really is and its all Errolls fault. He starts to go to far with his obsession of finding a missing girl when his job isnt to be a police officer. Its a fairly decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works outside his  scope of practice.  Erroll did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of Allison. It has some good mystery to it too and just when I had it figured out, there was more to it.#1
7647_7#Ok, so it borrows a little from  Its a Wonderful Life , but that was 44 years prior to this film, so why not a new attempt. Belushi is having a rotten 35th birthday. He didnt get his Wheaties, his coffee, and has lost his job. The capper is when his self described  big blue piece of sh    car breaks down at the end of the day. He heads into an empty bar to call for a tow. While waiting, hes recognized by the bartender (Caine) as the kid who lost the towns championship baseball game 20 years earlier. This gets him to thinking how life wouldve been if he had won the game. He finds out when, unbeknownst to him, Caine serves up a motion potion in a glass that gives him a mansion, the prom queen (Russo) as his wife, and makes him president of the sporting goods company hes been canned from. Caine later reveals himself as the one whos responsible for this change, but Belushi is not entirely on board. He never fully adjusts, and in a plot development that doesnt kill the movie but is still odd, he tries to court his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, who is now married to someone else. The good move is that they dont spend too much time on it, as basically they rip of  Ghost , with Belushi constantly telling Hamilton things only she could know. It also brings in a hokey dramatic element, as two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows, new wife Russo, and his unbalanced lover Cox. But the keys to the film are the somewhat lengthy beginning, and cheery end. Also good work from the big and recognizable cast, as Belushi is very likable, VERY attractive ladies chosen, and Caine is perfectly easy going as the title guy. Strange that this was Belushis second film of 1990 dealing with him getting an alternative lifestyle of riches, which was found in  Taking Care of Business . Though similar, both films are on the same level of laughs provided. So check this out for a fun exploration of  what if?  #1

3131_2#The Fallen Ones starts with archaeologist Matt Fletcher (Casper Van Dien) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant, now theres something you dont see everyday. Matt is working for property developer Morton (Robert Wagner) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist Angela (Kristen Miller) for reasons Im unsure of. Anyway they both try to figure out what theyve got on theyre hands when some of the team go missing, Morton calls in security guy Ammon (Navid Negahban) to handle the situation. Meanwhile ancient text translator the Rabbi Eli Schmidtt (Tom Bosley) translates some ancient text (as he would) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the Fallen One, or something like that. Its up to Matt to save the day & the whole planet The Fallen Ones is a bad film, theres no two ways about it as far as Im concerned. Not recommended on any level or in any way, one to avoid.#0
263_4#After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. The movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the lack of acting ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to David Morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, dont plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night.#0
1137_8#Its very very funny. You know, just like a comedy is supposed to be. It also looks very very good, like a Hollywood Spectacular should. So, what more do you want? Howz about a very VERY good Sally Fields. She is so much better here than in anything else Ive ever seen her in, and she looks so damn good. This movie is all you need to understand why shes a Star. Those eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, everyones eyes are so good. I used to pretend to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend. Wed do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner. They dont do that at all in Soap Dish. Great. The Eyes Have It! (sorry)  Soap Dish is better than I thought itd be, better that I wanted it to be. Im sick of Movies that tell me Im supposed to care about shallow, self centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. TV Soap Actors. Soap Dish seems happy just to have me laugh at em. Thank You.#1
4176_2#Perhaps I missed the meeting when the meaning of  B-movie  was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. You want a good synopsis of this movie? Take Aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that was good about it, and thats pretty much it. Watching this afterbirth of a film, the only amusement I got was from the feeble attempts at set-making. Since when does taping PCI computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship? The money required to do this film could have been put to much more better use.#0
8957_3#Incredible. Does it get any dumber than this? Not a chance. The stupidity in this movie would shame even Ed Wood, De Palma, and Woo. If the first part in the series had mediocre dialog and the second one had bad dialog, then this one has cretinous dialog. Amazing. But this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog, too. In spite of the acting and the dialog, I liked the first two films, but  Cube Zero  will surely kill the franchise. The utterly moronic plot so obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated left-winger. Back to the movie apart from being so far-fetched that it isnt even funny any more, the film has many obvious illogicalities. For example, for some reason the two men who supervise the cube have done it for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism that the project entails, yet the first one than the other suddenly turn against the system! Anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or how about that cretinous character, the one-eyed evil bureaucrat who talks as if hes in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, as soon as this creature appears the movie loses ALL seriousness and hence any chance of being exciting it really does become a comedy.#0
2922_4#Take young, pretty people, put them in an exotic locale, stick in a few bad guys, have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes, create the flimsiest of plots, then work out a happy ending for everybody (other than the three or four who get murdered, of course) Thats the classic (and successful) format of the Harlequin Romance. Its not very good but then its not very bad either, like most of the little yellow pocket books. And the location stuff in Budapest is especially interesting, even if they didnt use the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or show the citys famous thermal baths.#0
1736_10#Look, this is quite possibly one of the best movies America has to offer the rest of the world. To hate this movie is to hate freedom itself. I remember that the early 80s were a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. Out of that confusion came a hero, Stroker Ace. Ned Beattys performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness. His triumph is an inspiration to all. The on-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws obvious comparisons to Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!#1
6403_3#.as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. Barely even reaching feature length,  Can I Do It.Till I Need Glasses  is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you cant believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the punchline (example the Santa Claus gag); others are so long that you cant believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT punchline (example the students awards gag). And nearly all are directed without any artistry. Dont get me wrong about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy! But none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than   out of 4.#0
5617_8#After his classic film noir homage Chinatown Roman Polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which, like Repulsion and Rosemarys Baby, deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment living. The Tenant is more polished and less pretentious than Repulsion, but it lacks the suspense and the character that make Rosemarys Baby so engrossing and entertaining. The Tenant is good, with no major flaws, and Polanski was really on top form as a director, but its not among his most gripping works.#1
3325_1#Hated it. If you believe that everyone in the South is dumb, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, a religious nut, or a child molester, then this film may be for you. Everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant. In one scene, two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he had molested a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life. Very nice. A teenage girl walks the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers to help her -- despite an obvious limp and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathairns character is not only thoroughly disgusting and slimy, but he is shown to be a religious believer who (typical for Hollywood) reflects the vile nature of Christians. A scene in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro) -- Bible verses being spouted by the bad guy. I am from the Great Northwest, but found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know who are from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.#0

3545_4#The film  52 Pick Up  simply does not work. See it if you are at all interested in Elmore Leonard or John Frankenheimer, or anyone in the terrific cast, especially John Glover whos admittedly brilliant. But the book--a slow-burning, noir thriller with lots of pulp--should have translated into an Oscar-contending film instead of this dud that couldnt figure out whether it should faithfully portray the hard-boiled, gritty crime story of the book, or opt for a 1980s Schwarzenegger shoot-em-up spree. Shifting the scene from the original locale in the book, Detroit (an area where Leonard has resided for years and knows very well), to Los Angeles makes for a substantial problem that Leonard tries to fix in his script, but ultimately cant. It was, for example, a clever device making Mitchells wife a City Councilwoman (she had no job in the book), if you think about it thats the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sex-crazed city like 1980s Los Angeles for adultery, or any type of potential sex scandal. Even then, its more plausible in a more conservative Eastern state like Michigan to believe that a) its tiny porno  industry  is a sleazy, money-grubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a not-so-stupid upper-middle-class fellow going through a mid-life crisis, and b) adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with, if their upstanding careers and old-fashioned wives couldnt handle the shock. As consultant Ron Jeremy will tell you, 1980s Los Angeles was a colorful, stylish porno Mecca, more like the movie  Boogie Nights  than Leonards dark, shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses, grimy apartments, and drug deals in depressed urban squalor. Then again, Los Angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully--there are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there. Unfortunately, Roy Scheiders Harry Mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy, handsome Uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat. In the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing. He also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for, but never appeared to come to grips with. Elmore Leonards stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and law-abiding citizen. Here, Harry Mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer, Alan Raimy, turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom, makes for such a central image. Glovers blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence, but Scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky  good guy,  in charge of the situation as if he were more a Rambo with an M-16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him.  52 Pick Up  ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever, considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film. Trapping Raimy inside Mitchells Jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by Mitchell, plays to an audience wanting the  sweet revenge  conclusion of a Chuck Norris movie, not the intelligent balanced world of Leonards book, where Mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way. I left the theater shaking my head and depressed. What a waste of talent.#0
1081_4#There is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie. Is it the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh that were supposed to be pulling for? Well, lets see -- we learn hes a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities. He treats his coworkers like cattle, gets them involved in his own personal crisis (in the process, getting one of them killed), jeopardizes the safety of his kids, threatens his ex-wifes new boyfriend, tries to strong-arm the police and school administrators -- and all this for what? Because he was THINKING WITH HIS LITTLE HEAD! I was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swampit would have made for a far more satisfying ending.#0
1745_7#How truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; I rejoiced in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. Its the document of a longlost craft. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic . It refreshes the mind. Its not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. This serial is unjustly bashed.#1

4790_10#Upon The Straight Story release in 1999, it was praised for being David Lynchs first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal. Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere 66 mower, at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct. Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynchs trademark motifs coming through. So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynchs complex narratives or trademark dialogue, the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended #1

489_7#Walking home after the film, I was humming the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were dancing to. Ive heard that before - where? Ah, from Kubricks  Eyes Wide Shut  (track 2), got it just as I arrived at the door. Its  Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2  composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack from Towers. What a treat! The film score by Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz. Its not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score. Reminds me of favorite scores by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (beginning notes of track 6 have traces of  Nuovo cinema Paradiso ), Georges Delerue, and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings, celeste, piano, and harp.  I highly recommend the soundtrack if you dont feel like going to the movies. Alexandre Desplats lyrical film score of  The Luzhin Defence  is complete.#1

Im really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda, and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its Bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses.#0

He loved it - and the discussion.)#1
2068_8#1958. The sleepy small Southern town of Clarksburg. Evil Sheriff Roy Childress (the almighty Vic Morrow in peak nasty form) cracks down super hard on speeders by forcing said offenders off a cliff to their untimely deaths on an especially dangerous stretch of road. Childress meets his match when cool young hot rod driver Michael McCord (a splendidly smooth and brooding portrayal by Martin Sheen) shows up in town in his souped-up automobile with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother (Sheens real-life sibling Joe Estevez in a brief cameo). Director Richard T. Heffron, working from a taut and intriguing script by Richard Compton (the same guy who directed the 70s drive-in movie gems  Welcome Home, Soldier Boys  and  Macon County Line ), relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, neatly creates a flavorsome 50s period setting, and ably milks plenty of suspense out the tense game of wit and wills between Childress and McCord. The uniformly fine cast helps a lot Sheen radiates a brash James Deanesque rebellious vibe in the lead, Morrow makes the most out of his meaty bad guy part, plus there are excellent supporting performances by Michelle Phillips as sweet diner waitress Maggie, Stuart Margolin as a folksy deputy, Nick Nolte as amiable gas station attendant Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as Buzzs endearingly gawky younger brother Lyle, Janit Baldwin as sassy local tart Sissy, Britt Leach as stingy cab driver Johnny, and Frederic Downs as the stern Judge J.A. Hooker. The climactic vehicular confrontation between Childress and McCord is a real pulse-pounding white-knuckle thrilling doozy. Terry K. Meades sharp cinematography, the well-drawn characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with busting speeders after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and run incident), the groovy, syncopated score by Luchi De Jesus, and the beautiful mountainside scenery all further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made-for-TV winner.#1

7171_10#Holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people. One of them I will name, the other two are mysteries and will remain so. Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV. He is unlucky in life. Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IVs `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Those particular exploits cursed the familys men to many an ill-fated turn. It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV. He has been accused, falsely, of stealing a pair of baseball shoes, freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction, by a famous baseball player. He is given the option of jail, or he can go to a character building camp. `Ive never been to camp before, says Stanley. With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake. Holes is an intelligent, insightful and witty family movie. It entertains, and not in any cheap way. It is not a comedy, though it has its laughs. It dares to be compelling, where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional. As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy. I give it a 10.#1
8108_3#After reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the movie didnt give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed. This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.Either that or he is simply bad. Most importantly where is the lightness?! From the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie. I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here. Instead the music manages to give everything that movie feel, in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy. There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesnt convert well into a movie, such is Kunderas style. This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film. A film which is as long as it is uncompelling. For those who havent read the book yet I recommend just reading that. For those who have, I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear warnings.#0
5482_10#This is an astounding film. As well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust Chavez, we are given the background picture which describes a class-divided society. Many of the rich, it appears, have a choice with the peoples democratic choice, and are willing to use the military for regime change. Be careful what you say in front of your servants is a revealing comment. The head of the countrys biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president, with US backing, and these young Irish film makers have it all on camera. A great film to educate young people about democracy. We see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated, and force used, in the interests of big business, against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people. Riveting stuff.#1
3495_1#I watched an episode. Yes I sat through the entire miserable experience, and I have to say, this brand of comedy is one of the worst you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin, of Family Guy fame. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a(admittedly slim and minus the glasses) woman, except that he now lacks the something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he doesnt know hes an idiot. Sarah has none of the genuine character, none of the acting ability to pull her character off. Maybe its the trite, formulaic jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character can take it by herself. Maybe its the lack of believable foils. Her insensitive, bigoted persona may appeal to insensitive, bigoted people unlike the mass appeal that Stephen Colberts insensitive, bigoted character has. Like Bill OReilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. She lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire, let alone for the entire world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman lacks, its noticeable. And when you dont believe it and identify with it, its not funny anymore.#0
7724_1#Seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, I figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasnt quite meant to be. I watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by Lungren, and all of the other thrown-in Oriental actors, and I found the movie so awful that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out its welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie EVER. A BAD BAD MOVIE #0
6732_10#This was the best documentary Ive ever seen  I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well. Great Job Stacy! I was kicking back at work last week, bored O &^%less and this movie came on. Growing up in Orange County in the 80s I surfed up and down the local beaches and so did my dad when he was a teenager. I grew up at the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I body surfed, boogeyboarded then moved up from there. This movie just captivated me. It was way before my time but it was awesome to see what these guys went through..TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collectors item.#1
606_10#I have seen a lot of Saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music, dance, drama and great cinema in his movies. Ibéria shows an even better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that called my attention is the fact that, in this movie, dancers and musicians, dance and music, are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation, examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing. The interest of Saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works. Thats why I recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.#1
6926_10#The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father. The world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman Wyat Earp.  Winchester 73 is a fine example of the western genre, and acts as the objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes.#1
4296_1#I was going to say this was the worst gay-themed film Ive ever seen, but I can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre Ive ever seen. You know youre in trouble when a movie starts with a  personal note  from the Director, asking for the audiences  understanding  for the  many challenges  facing a first-time Director. The audio track is so bad in many scenes its almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this from a DVD version. Bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, poor script, generally bad acting all add up to make this  film  unwatchable. I did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts, and immediately gave away the DVD I foolishly purchased. Im sure there are many challenges facing a first-time Director. But, dont try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product. I see from IMDb details that this was not only the first Directing attempt of Richard Natale, but also the only. Thats the one positive thing I can say about this alleged  movie .#0
12123_1#Recently, I had opportunity to view a working print in Kansas City (Olathe, KS.) of this title. It is difficult for me, being a lover of the art as I am, to report the following, but, the truth sometimes hurts, and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe (Im using the slang definition here - worthless statements or writing) for an hour and a half, I feel obligated to share (WARN) any interested parties. Lets begin at the beginning, a good place to start as always. The first 15 minutes are not really that bad, a couple of laughs, and decent development, but then it is downhill from there. This is the story of a woman, in her mid thirties, that (as the writer would like for you to believe) is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled. The first major difficulty occurs when if you dont know that fact going into the movie, you wont know it when she suddenly risks it all for, in my opinion, a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman. There is little development (drastically insufficient development) to justify her actions for the affair she has, and when it occurs, one feels, as I did, that she is just of low moral character. The word  slut  comes to mind, hopefully, theyll let that pass the review and post the comment. This, in my opinion, is the first fatal flaw of the film. If youre married or have ever been in love, irregardless of whether you are male or female, its going to turn you off. Quite frankly, I feel that it would have made a much better  blue movie  - thats the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving. The second fatal flaw is the casting, Diane Lane just didnt work for me here, and Viggo Mortensen is not the right man for the job, believe me. The only saving grace to the entire film is Anna Paquin, the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places, conveying a subtle yet very blunt (I apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate) portrayal of an emerging teen. Bravo, well done. Im not going to give the ending away, but I was disappointed, being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing but an ending like that. Well, if that teased you enough to see this picture, dont say I didnt warn you, but you better look fast - if this celluloid is released, I doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames. Id say wait for the video, but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value. Hmmm, Dustin Hoffman produced this, you think hed learn after Ishtar. This film once carried the working title  Blouse Man  and should have been left on the rack. If youve never in your life wanted to walk out on a film, give this one 35-40 minutes, the only thing worth staying for is Anna Paquin, if you can stomach the fact that youll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home, which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if youre off to the movies to see this one. Thats my two cents, for what it is worth.#0
9633_7#In many ways DIRTY WORK is a predictable L&H short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone`s chimney . Guess what happens next ? That`s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues . Having said that this is still a good short mainly down to Stan . Also watch out for a scene featuring a fish . Many jokes/plots from L&H feature fish and this is another one#1
11916_3#Yuck. I thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written. The acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times. Why would a  demonico  kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for the heck of it? And is it really necessary to show Liliths motorcycle whenever shes out somewhere. We get it! You spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket. It doesnt mean you have to show it all the time! The  Faiths  lair looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica set with some last minute changes. There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance. Everyone is a throwaway character. Forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movies Ive seen the SciFi channel come out with. Stay away unless youre into bad movies.#0
909_1#dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film. the way it is shot, lit, acted etc. just doesnt make sense. its all so bad it is difficult to watch. loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom. there seems to be no normal person in the entire film and the existence of the outside world is, well, it just doesnt exist. and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden? this film is beyond stupidity. zero.#0
8387_1#This was the worst movie Ive ever seen in theaters. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People getting hit in the head is not funny. People getting kicked is not funny. After the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore. It just got tired fast. There wasnt anything positive about this movie. I dont like my entertainment to be dumbed down.#0
10903_10#This man is nothing short of amazing. You truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events, and cry along with his family in the end. He was so passionate about his cause, not just for himself, but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain. I watch this video every time I am having a bad or  down  day, and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life, just like Jonny did, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is not knowing about Jonny sooner, as I visited England 2 times during his life, and would have been able to say Id met him. It is comforting to know Jonny is sitting on his cloud, pain free! Rest in peace, Dear Jonny. You deserve it #1

6217_1#I seriously cant believe Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, two people I LOVE, signed on to produce this crap. Tim Burton is a brilliant director, but to be honest Ive been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations. He did produce the brilliant  Nightmare Before Christmas , which is one Ive watched multiple times, and directed movies like  Beetlejuice  and  Sleepy Hollow , which are awesome films. Bekmambetov directed 3 films that I LOVE Night Watch, Day Watch, and Wanted. Ive only seen those three of his, but they prove hes an awesome director. While its true that this movie is very pretty looking, pretty is as pretty does, and 9 does squat. Im sure Burton fans will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie without a doubt, in fact with his and Bekmambetovs names being thrown around the promos, people will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie. I know I may be making a big deal out of nothing, but watching this movie made me realize how much I hate movies with unlikeable characters, nonexistent plot and just pure style over content. And this movie is one of those movies.#0

6692_9#I saw  Mystery Men  on my birthday in 1999 while I was away on vacation. When I came back home, I went to see it again. Keep in mind, I was twelve, but at that time it was the coolest movie ever. I even collected the ultra-rare action figures (I have them all except for the Bowler, which is the hardest to find. They made Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, The Blue Raja, The Spleen and Captain Amazing, in case your wondering. There IS a William H. Macy action figure in existence!). Ive watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine, due mostly to fond childhood memories. Its not a perfect movie, but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following. Unfortunately, the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have. A sequel was originally planned (the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from  The Flaming Carrot  comics. The Flaming Carrot was planned for the sequel I believe) but this did not do well at the box office. It could have been a hard sell, a superhero comedy with the guy from  Theres Something About Mary.  It also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as  The Sixth Sense --which ended up being the biggest hit for the month of August--as well as  The Thomas Crown Affair.  Two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend, oddly enough-- Dick  and  The Iron Giant.  Critics gave MM passable reviews, but it was quickly forgotten. Sadly enough, on Comedy Centrals Roast of Jerry Stiller, comedian Jeffrey Ross commented to Ben Stiller that,  I saw Mystery Men and I fired MY agent.  Ben is then seen to mouth the words,  I should have to.  Dont listen to him. Give  Mystery Men  a chance.#1
3687_1#Its not just that this is a bad movie; its not only that four of the  best  Mexican movie makers are in this film; and its not only that the script is terrible. Its just thatthis movie sucksbig time. This people are wasting money in terrible scripts. Its supposed to make a criticism about Mexican society but were fed up with this kind of films. Is bad language supposed to be funny? I dont get it. Mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movies are going to continue playing (and being written and produced). Please, dont think this kind of movies are well received in Mexico We hate them and they dont reflect us.#0
8881_8#First one has to take into account the time period this film was made in. 1995. Rappers were in it, and that added to the flair of it. I dont think Cube and Busta coulda beat those Nazis though.#1
7684_7#Reading all of the comments Are very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasnt gotten any credit in this sight yet. So if you dont mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist I would also like to tell him  job well done . I know this Sight is for the GOOD TIMES cast but, wouldnt you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all. I would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his work displayed in my home.#1
6310_3#I watched this movie last night and was a bit disappointed. A lot of the  time facts  were off. At the beginning of the movie, the grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9-11 hit. This movie was supposed to be taking place in 1994. Also, one of the grandsons friends was wearing an Eagles Donovan McNabb jersey. He hadnt even been drafted as of yet. The story line was good but the facts and actuality of the time frame was so far off base that it made the movie seem cheesy. My boyfriend is an avid reader of WWII books and memorabilia. I rented this movie hoping that it would be good. The acting was so-so. The dog was cute. But the way that this movie was carried out made me glad that I only paid 4 dollars to rent it as opposed to the 50 it would have taken me to watch it in a theater. I hope that who ever reads this understands that I mean no discontent to those who fought the war but the facts and time frame should have been a little more closely monitored.#0
6284_4#I liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem I quickly found is that one pretty much knows whats going to happen within the first 20-30 minutes ( the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody). Admittedly the scenes beyond the mirror were chilling when they first appeared and the blondes murder is also effectively creepy, but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script, piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite dull.#0
7691_9#This show was a landmark in American comedy as it was the first sitcom to star an all Afro-American cast. Sadly though it was never broad-casted on British TV. Best Episode Sex and the Evans family- Series 1 episode 6. The Fosters episode of it was called Sex in the Black Community. The other episode I saw, Black Jesus was a title of one episode of  The Fosters  #1
1954_3#First, lets get it out of the way. . . yeah, this film steals a LOT from Darkness Falls (2003). The plot for Darkness Falls goes something like this The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge. In The Tooth Fairy (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (who, yeah, hides her face) unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone. A little too similar to be coincidence. Final Verdict 3/10 -AP3-#0
6098_1#Scotty (Grant Cramer, who would go on to star in the great B-movie  Killer Klowns from outer space ) agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn how to dialog the ladies in this bad 80s comedy. Not bad as in 80s lingo, which meant good. Bad as in bad. With no likable characters, including, but not limited to, a kid whos the freakiest looking guy since  Friday the 13th part 2   a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her, and the token fat slob, because after all what would an 80s sex comedy be without a fat slob?? Well this one has two. This movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of 80s sex comedies. And then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel. Where I saw it Comcast Moviepass#0
11325_10#When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV,I have to say that out of all the shows that I have seen,this one tops it all off. I had to see this show,and that is what I really did. When I got the first volume of this show,it was the best. I really liked the animation,and all the fight scenes were awesome. I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber,and Archer and of course I also like Illya. And of course,all the episodes on the volumes were interesting,and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie(famous for Transformers,and others) playing the voice of Berserker. He does have a cool character. And I even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume. So if you to see something good,then see this show,its the best.#1
1235_10#This movie was good for its time. If you like Eddie Murpy this is a must have to add to your collection. Eddie was young and funny with his 80s haircut. Charlotte Lewis, Eddies costar is hot. This was one of her first movies and she was not bad. The graphics were good for the 80s. A lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through IMDb. Other must have from Eddie is  Coming to America  and  48 hours . Another actor  Victor Wong  has a small part in this movie. Check out some of his older movies like  Big trouble in little china . If you liked the action movies from the 80s this is your movie.#1
3176_9#I happened to catch this film at a screening in Brooklyn - its difficult to describe the plot; it has a lot of wacky characters, but lets just say Id have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the hardest, I wouldnt know where to begin. Even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted. Theres a lot here to like, funny back-stories, mishaps and misunderstandings which set up the final act and dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart; its a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout. Definitely worth seeing #1
6627_7#A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow  if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out. 7 out of 10#1
9622_3#When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980s and like everyone else who has grown up in that era, have seen every 80s teen and summer camp movie out there. So I couldnt wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre. What a disappointment  The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with hardly any plot and no substance. And the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didnt come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive. The only good things about this film were the wardrobe, music, and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80s, and the same goes for the music. And the acting was top-notch throughout almost all of Hollywoods best comedians were present. Too bad they didnt have better material to work with.#0
1426_1#One question Why? First off, the premise is not funny or engaging at all. They use taped interviews, and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts. First off, the interviews arent funny or entertaining to begin with, and even if they were, I am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally, without being turned into cartoons. How does that add any hilarity to it? I turned on CBSs Monday night sitcom line-up, (which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful Monday workdays) and found this on. Of course, the sitcom line-up would be reruns anyway, being summer, but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining. I tried to give  CC  a chance. I really did. When it started, I figured, well, maybe it will be funny. Nope. And then it kept going. It was a long half hour. And I can almost see if there was a purpose, if the interviews were shown in their entirety, and had points to them. But no, it was just one-line clips, cut and pasted together really quick. It was like a horrible dreadful version of Cartoon Networks  Robot Chicken.  I wasnt a fan of CBS now-cancelled sitcom  The Class.  WHile that was on, it was one half-hour of the line-up I would struggle through. But if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of  Creatures .lets just say Id take the  Class.  Considering its been a couple hours since it aired, and I come on here to see I am the first to commentI guess thats a good sign that nobody watched it, and that it wont last much longer. Cartoon roadkill.#0
8598_1#Just kidding! This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was so bad though, that it was hilarious. My friend and I purposly rented it because it looked so bad. Cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs. The plot stunk, some of the voices were dubbed, the quality was horrendous. But I sure had a blast watching it!#0
11632_7#Greetings again from the darkness. What a relief  a thriller that actually is thrilling! New  IT  girl Rachel McAdams ( Wedding Crashers  and  The Notebook ) dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director Wes Craven ( Scream  movies and  A Nightmare on Elm Street ). Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. As with many thrillers, the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plot device leads us to believe little Rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through, but we cant help but cringe a bit. The most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests, an annoying airline passenger, Cillians injury and the FX at the hotel. The strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads. Sadly the fine screen veteran Brian Cox is under-utilized, but overall this is an above-average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale.#1
10513_7#If you have any clue about Jane Austen s production, you ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen s characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she s very good in her leading role. Also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious.#1
5713_10#I have lately got into the habit of purchasing any interesting DVD that the Criterion company releases. I figure that even if I dislike the movie, Criterion usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film. I read up on them, and I buy the ones which are the most interesting to me. P.S. - Some information for anyone who has the same faith in Criterion that I do and is planning to buy it. Amongst the Criterion discs I now own, Le Million contains the fewest features. All it has is a photo gallery (not all that useful; one might flip through it once) and a rare television interview with Rene Clair, the director. This piece is of some interest. He was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film, and when talkies were first appearing, he said that they represented the death of film. I think most film-savvy people understand what these directors meant when they said that, but it is interesting to hear him explain it. Also, if you have read the description of this movie on Amazon.com, please note that they were wrong in one important respect not every line in the film is sung. In fact, it contains no more songs than a regular musical. It is actually a lot more like a Chaplin or Buster Keaton or Marx Brothers film. My criticisms of the disc are not that important. Heck, Criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints. The fact is, their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only 20 (now 21!) people have voted for on imdb, and only about a hundred people, if that, will ever see the film. Heck, if you look at the Criterion web site, Le Million is nowhere to be found. I have no clue why not. Its something they should really be proud of (of course, their web site is surprisingly horrible). They did a fine job on this film. Bravo! They deserve all the money I can stand to give them!#1
3699_3# One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role, to be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie, and that wasnt even during the final comedy-scene (which one would also expect to be the funniest). This is one you can watch when it comes to TV, dont spend any other money renting it.#0

12466_7#If Jean Renoirs first film  Whirlpool of Fate  first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards. Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great  Grand Illusion  and  Rules of the Game.  This is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the films interiors, and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well, particularly from Werner Krauss Muffat. But the glamorous and sultry Ms. Hessling, who at first appears as if she might give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampishness, never goes beyond a one note, selfish harlot portrayal. Perhaps this is in part a problem with the script, which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions; not having read the novel Im not really clear on whether the choices were well-made or not. Far from his greatest achievement, and for me probably just shy overall of  Whirlpool of Fate , this is still well worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally.#1
5726_1#An obvious b-grade effort to cash in on the Hostel/Saw buzz, my expectations for this film were low (really low!) and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level. The acting is so bad its not even funny, the plot-line is non-existent and the only scare was realizing that I had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it! Im surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. The 34th is possibly the directors mother? - although Im sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2! DVD extras include an hour long  making of  feature. Which raises the question,  Why?  (although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.#0
2268_10#I havent yet read Kurt Vonneguts Mother Night (though Ive read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). After seeing Keith Gordons film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. Its the kind of material that Im sure if it wasnt made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-Holocaust/WW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. Its about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about. Its not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of  whoa  as in any spy story. But its the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. I have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment its hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post WW2/holocaust storytelling.#1
10062_1#Nintendo  YOU %$@ERS  How could you do this to me? I cant believe itthis movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along.oh Godwhere do I even begin? The plot SUCKED. The voice acting SUCKED. The animation SUCKED. The ending REALLY SUCKED. If you liked this movie, YOU SUCK TOO. And to Futuramafan1987, who said this was the greatest movie ever, you are a TOOL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. This isnt a movie for anyone but crack-addled ten-year olds with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. Im still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie.and then there was Pikachus Adventuredont even get me started on that horrible mess of a film. It is, in all truth, one of the most boring experiences of my entire life. Dont go watch this at any costs. Bottom Line Go out, find every copy of this movie that you can, and burn it. Burn them all, and then proceed to rent a GOOD movie, like Aliensor Bowling For Columbineor even Back to the Future!#0
8088_7#I remember watching this late at night on black and white TV, long before a live-action version was so much as a twinkle in Peter Jacksons eye and being very impressed. Finally getting my hands this week on a VHS copy that was being thrown away (and isnt that just par for the course..?) I had the chance to revisit this film, and found that it still stands up quite well, although its not quite the success that memory had painted. The big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project, with a bizarre tacked-on voice-over ending attempting to resolve matters. A pity; it would have been interesting, not to mention less frustrating, to see what Bakshi planned to make of Shelob and Minas Tirith, never mind the Dead#1
7153_8#My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, having read it to several of her classes. It never sounded all that interesting to me, though, and I bought the DVD figuring this would be a movie that wouldnt really be up my alley. #1
9036_10#My wife did not realize what a gem this movie was when she picked it up. It is a story that shows real world success through hard work and determination. That is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that I dis-like them), but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it.#1
2565_9#I really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between American servicemen and Japanese women in post-war Japan--as well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them. Brando goes from having contempt for the Japanese (which is natural considering WW2) to falling in love with a Japanese woman and wanting to marry her. His performance is okay (I am not a major fan of his acting style) and the movie is marvelous throughout. Red Buttons received an Oscar for his touching performance of another GI who falls in love in Japan (though the Japanese women who plays opposite him also did a remarkable job). This movie manages to say SOMETHING and be entertaining at the same time. A mostly underrated gem.#1
9968_4#As an ex-teacher(!) I must confess to cringing through many scenes - though I continued to watch to the end. I wonder why?! (Boredom, perhaps?) -) #0
3424_1#You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not,  How did it get made,  because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do so. And  dcreasy2001  (aka Mark Blankfield?) Its just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequels lone cheerleader as an IMDb user comment. I was praying for you to veer over into satire, but alas, you were really making an effort at spin. Why not 10 stars?#0
7217_1#I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns, so my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me half way through. The saddles, costumes, accents--everything was off. The part that made me so mad is where the guy didnt shoot the  collector  with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guys soul. His only excuse was  he only had 2 arrows left.  We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else saidtoo many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. I mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, whats the point of that? And why were there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, this may be your movie. However, if you want a real Western, you will hate this movie.#0
4793_4#Its been close to ten years since Ive seen either of the last two sequels to  Phantasm  - surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good. That being acknowledged to this day, Im still a huge fan of the first two installments so I thought Id go back and re-experience the final chapters. Part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesnt make much sense Again, kicking off right where the previous movie left us, Reggie saves Mike from the Tall Man who vows to come back for him later, but things arent safe for long when they come across Jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere. Apparently his soul is held prisoner by the Tall Man so Mike is then dragged into the sinister double-pronged Netherworld and Reg has to find him Along the way, he meets up with a ten year-old kid and a nun-chuck wielding black chick named Rocky who assist him throughout his journey. So, its a  Phantasm  movie with very little gore, nudity, and quadruple-barrel shot guns. Need I say more?#0

2754_10#I really love this movie, saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great directing/camera-work/music. It is a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this one. Top 5 work. Really  Today, its 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above. it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines. Anyway, i saw  le huitieme jour  again yesterday. This is with no doubt in my movie top 3. together with  Cinema Paradiso  which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also really good. I am really curious about  jaco von dormaels  new movie. I hope it will complete my movie top 3. If you see this movie, rent it. Or even better. buy it. Because you will want to see it again.#1
1112_1#I enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit. The script and dialogue is laughable. The acting was awful, where did they get them from? Music was OK i have to say. Luckily i didnt buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of. I was geared up at the beginning when the stranger (martin sheen) started to tell his story. I have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex where Hopalong shot Texs finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league. But thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter. I had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better, never did.#0
7673_1#I dont know where to begin. Tara Reid needs to be stopped before shes put in another movie. Stephen Dorff looks like he got his characters motivation from Val Kilmer in  Top Gun . Slater sleepwalks through this dreck. The direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy-metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on them), and hey, theres no discernible plot either. It amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said,  hey guys, this just doesnt make any sense, lets start over . Hopefully Slaters career can rebound from this disaster. Hands down the worst film Ive ever seen.#0
10506_1#When teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow. The package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the Sirens were cast. Roberts swears blind in voice over, I didnt want to make a film that was like Baywatch as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground. There is also a simpering, self-indulgent documentary about the making of Darkhunters during which Roberts says that a reviewer has claimed that Forest is  The best British film in years . I dont know who he is trying to convince. At one point in the commentary track Roberts says jokingly  I can see people sitting at home saying  this isnt amazing, its sh$t  he isnt wrong.#0
8403_10#i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way! i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched, it. this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format. Ratings john     1/2 Sam      #1
1485_10#This movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts, I love the final, when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life, but its completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right, is jut for two, so what are the other persons doing there? The movie embrace you to a new life, to experiences, to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams. Also shows you the life itself, hard like it is. But gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. Hope this comment works for you. The movie it did worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way ;) Take care.#1
1578_8#Rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity. Reichdeutch women find that their Jewish Husbands have been locked up pending deportation. One an aristocrat disowned by her family, Lena Fischer, finds herself among the mob as does General Gudarians sister. But rank and privilege merit no special consideration.  I did deem it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the Ostfront.#1
7562_1#I havent seen the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far Wicker Man is the worst movie Ive seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it. Do not go see this flick. Or even rent it on DVD.#0
7348_3#I was really disappointed with this film. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I watched Polyester and really sort of hated it. The only thing I liked about that movie was DIVINE. She/He had a hell of a lot of talent. I was truly surprised. As a whole, I wouldnt recommend this film#0
3749_9#I laughed a lot while watching this. Its an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization. The dialog is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully. Theres Max, who has apparently led a horrible life. And theres Edward, who isnt sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edwards insane boss. Tom has a short role but a memorable one. Highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I am a fan of all of Jasons cartoons and cant wait to see what he comes out with next.#1
10626_1#this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any REAL evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example Bart Sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldnt there be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 went through the van Allan radiation belts they spent 30 Mins there not the 90 Mins claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray. seriously do some research learn what really happened dont let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened#0
4397_3#One of my sisters friends lent me this game, and it is too damn hard! It carries the appearance of a kids game, but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions, and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, to improve your score  You also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY UP TO STAGE THREE  Maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this, but otherwise keep away! AND IT IS DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS - THEY WILL PULL THEIR HAIR OUT WITHIN THE HOUR!#0
12262_3#Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal Crocodile (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and Lake Placid. Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater-crocodile supposedly is 90 years old, over 30 ft long (!) and it kills for fun! During the film, he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though its a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvelous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. Theres a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You wont believe some of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake theyre not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielbergs great white shark. The visual effects in Blood Surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I wont say too much about the acting since its secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again. But funny for a whole other reason than James Hickox intended.#0
3027_1#If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Tony Scotts poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of Domino Harveys life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting. Keira Knightley does get totally naked in this one though. That is the one and only upside to this film. If you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and youll catch a whole lot of nipple. I strongly suggest that no one see this movie EVER!</3#0
3848_4#The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers. With the horrible notoriety after the trial, the two women team up and leave N.Y. for California in order to open and song and dance studio for Shirley Temple-like girls. The ending is of the macabre and who can forget Winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look?#0
9053_2#Simply, I found the TV show  Mash  trite, preachy, oh ever so  politically correct , repetitious, pretentious and biggest sin of all, and that is,? that it is (was) incredibly dull. You have Alan Alda as the main lead,  (star) , who is so in love with himself and his cleverness, that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson, and Wayne Rogers, whom Ill happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found dull, also to no fault of her own wasnt a wonder to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on. Seeing one show a year showed that to me. Jamie Farr was just low brow  comedy  and is not even worth really mentioning here at all. The reason I did not give it a (one) rating, which anyone reading this by now would be wondering, is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call, but a relative one. Television, except for relatively few exceptions, is such crud. That relatively speaking, Mash had some production quality, (by television standards) of that era and today, and therefore it is deserved of a two. Rob Ritter#0
5925_7#Because of all the negative reviews of this film I almost didnt watch it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie. The acting wasnt great - apart from the wonderful Alice Krige - but some of the dialogue ( Just consider yourself lunch. ) was quite amusing. On the whole an above average Stephen King effort - 7/10.#1
8174_9#I love this movie. As a kid, this was one of the first movies I saw that made me flinch. Sure, it is mild now, but back in the day, it was awesome. Dentists are one thing so many people fear, so why not do a movie about a killer dentist? Its cheesy, its fun, sometimes its scary, but it is awesome. And I have always had a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone perfectly, no one could have done it better. And for a low budget horror film, the effects and such are quite good. And I also love the theme music, it goes well with the film. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also in this one playing a nosy cop, and does a fine job. There is a fair amount of blood, and some really cool torture/death scenes. Check this one out!#1
12009_3#I had a video of the thing. And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep. Its slow-moving, and the idea of a mid-Atlantic platform, which may have been revolutionary at the time, is now just a great big yawnaroony. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable, and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting. When the water started to spill big-time it even, on one occasion, woke me up. But give the man his due. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He doesnt wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals. He holds it in his fingers, while showing us the old pearly-browns. There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background,and looks very artistically done. But it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke.#0
11332_1#As big as a Texas prairie and equally as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills, and Dennis Hopper cant float this overbloated boat. Taylor actually LOOKS bad--wrong wardrobe, wrong hair, and wrong makeup--a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career. Hopper gives the only believable performance, and Dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually dont remember him for--a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what a, say, Redford could have done with the male lead. There is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes, just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other. Except for Hopper, there is no character development, only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery. To its credit, the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and it does have SIZE, making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests. Those with the DVD version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk. You wont be missing anything of interest.#0
6286_8#gone in 60 sec. where do i began, it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars. people say its not a good movie i disagree sure it has some cheesy parts but what action movie doesnt. i gave it an 8 out of 10 cause of the action and the comic relief if you like the Rock or Face Off than this movie is right up your alley cage dose a good job along with one of the most under rated actors in my mind Del-Roy Lindo. i think sometimes people look to far into movies some times you need to sit back enjoy the movie and after words ask yourself did they achieve what they where showing. meaning if they where going for action was it action pact. if they where trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and trying to win every award out their well did they? i think they made the action movie they set out to make, give it a chance and you wont be sorry.#1
4622_8#I originally came across Linda Fefermans Seven Minutes in Heaven when I was 14 and worked at a video store and I loved it. I recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure. The movie stars Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before she would go on to win an Oscar for Beautiful Mind, as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays her best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely a milder, cuter and softer version of the Pretty in Pinks and Some Kind of Wonderfuls of the 1980s, which is exactly why it is so good. Its honest, not forced like those films, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids. #1
10494_1#On Steve Irwins show, hes hillarious. He doesnt even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasnt even what I would call a movie-I mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him hes just saying Oh, this is one nasty bloke  and looking straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too much! And then when the guy falls off the car wouldnt you expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst acting Id ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve she just says Steve. She didnt sound scared or anything, it was just Steve. I mean I hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin but his movie was just too stupid.#0
1586_7#Rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions, which could have kept away many film goers looking for a Pianist similar plot. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary Aryan German rather from a Jewish standpoint. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims. The pace of the film is introspective, poignantly slow, meditative. Besides, the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been deftly crafted. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative flaws are well discerned. Another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters. Nevertheless, this film is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in German films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past,trend that includes such excellent films as Nowhere in Africa, and recently, the controversial Downfall. I would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images.#1
8031_1#The American Humane Association, which is the source of the familiar disclaimer  No animals were harmed  (the registered trademark of the AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me. I suppose one could say that at least the horse didnt die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making, but I cant help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this sure wouldnt have been the path he would have taken #0
10956_9#For those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity, you are in fact the mindless one. While the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems, racial barriers, clichés,stereotypes etc. You just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it. So dont take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that.#1
6056_9#Super Speedway makes a great demo of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in Grand Prix (if only that would appear on DVD!). I enjoy watching it again and again. The only minus, and why I didnt give it a 10, is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up. The soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. You wont hear swooshes as you go under bridges.#1
12228_8#I must admit Im a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to provoke. I think its a great horror/sci fi film. Colonel Steve West (Alex Rebar) returns to Earth after an historical space flight to Saturn. While in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease. He wakes up in a hospital bed, he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting! Escaping the hospitals supervision, he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town. Unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing hunger that can only be satisfied by eating other people. He must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive! Stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror! Its up to his old friend Dr Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning) to find him and try and help him. He has to work alone as his boss General Perry (Myron Healey) wants it kept ultra quiet. Nelson cant even tell his wife Judy (Ann Sweeny). However, Sheriff Blake (Micheal Alldredge) becomes suspicious as General Perry turns up just as some of the local townspeople start turning up half eaten. I dont really understand why this film gets such negative reviews, what do people expect? Anyway, I really like this film. The star of the film are unquestionably Rick Bakers Special Make-up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent, and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible CGI makes them even better. Writer and Director William Sachs isnt afraid to use them either, we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well, even now. Photography, music and direction are a little bit dull, but professional enough. The script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster, shots of him looking longingly into Ted Nelsons house, or when he sees his own reflection in some water and reacts violently. The ending, set in a large factory of some sort, is pretty downbeat so dont expect any happy ending. Which surprised me. Also, the script doesnt really do anything with the premise, he just walks around melting and killing, with his friend trying to stop him, maybe a bit too simple. Personally I think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion, her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too, it looks and sounds totally ridiculous! You need to see it to believe it! I like this film a lot and recommend it to 70s and 80s horror/sci fi fans. A bit of a favourite of mine.#1
2094_10#Sure, 65 years have passed since Thalbergs last production was filmed. But fellow IMDB members, come on, this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30s! It is a 10. Large scale and touching, what more could a movie lover want #1
7576_2#This was a quite brutal movie. There were huge implausibilities, and a silly script, bad acting, etc. The only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed.#0
11831_7#Despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of most uninspiring Disney films Ive seen, and I dont slam Disney films very often. Spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured, either by the cavalry or by Indians, both of which try to  break  him. Spirit ends up forming a bond with the Indian, and that, in a nutshell, is the story. With exception to the beautiful animation of the horses, neither I or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film. Its ironic that its titled  Spirit , as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of. An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this film is rated G, you will still probably have to end up explaining what  breaking a horse  means to your five year old. I did. #1
3535_1#Okay. Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Are you tripping of your head on Ecstasy pipes? There were so many of you. Did you do it for a dare? Is this some kind of cult? Or did Guy Richie himself sign up 788 times under different names? Please believe me. Its horrible.#0
1710_7#This movie is an exact copy of a TV series on Indian television channel doordarshan Which was aired at least 15 years ago. The series was known as  gubbarre  meaning balloons. Each episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and  convincing  Abhay Doel does a good job but he doesnt fit the role of a  normal  and  third class  guys(as he calls himself in the movie). In fact Shayan Munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the Abhays role but Shayan just doesnt have the talent to pull it off. But personally I feel this is a pathetic copy. No credit should be given to the director/scriptwriter. The story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of PRemchand munshi. I am not sure if this is premchand munshis story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshis and other great Hindi writers stories.#1
3517_1#I dont know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment on, I was irritated. Of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do the criminals act dumb, although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? Why doesnt the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot Stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. Id give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I just can give this movie 1 point#0
9735_1#I tried as hard as I could to sit all the way through this irritating mess, but I just couldnt do it. Brad Dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse.  Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be only a little worse than this. Get the idea?#0
11437_1#Sam (Thomas Cavanagh) and Gray (Heather Graham) are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things -- ballroom dancing, 1940s movie musicals and, much to their surprise, an attractive woman named Charlie (Bridget Moynahan). Historically heterosexual, Gray is confused by her new feelings. The acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast. Heather Graham gave the only good performance in the movie. She was funny and had a few charming scenes but its too bad that all of her co-stars were complete duds. Bridget Moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level. Also, it seemed like she was reading her lines. Thomas Cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion. The chemistry between Thomas and Heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony. I can usually rely on Molly Shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying. Sissy Spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them. Finally, Alan Cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasnt very good. Overall, Gray Matters is a lame film and it isnt worth watching. Rating 3/10#0
3265_2#I have no idea as to which audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-ills. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire 1970s,  Norman  plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention an elongated cameo by Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this tale of an estranged married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay--and living with a mincing, prancing white homosexual--has enough limp-wristed jokes to shame any early episode of  Threes Company . Bailey keeps her dignity, and Foxxs sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles, but the rest of the performers are humiliated.   from     #0
5484_10#This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. May Hugo Chavez open patriotic Americans eyes to the truth and beauty of the true American vision.#1
11398_4#I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she did very well acting her role. Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host, and model, it was not surprising. I was left wondering why she was killed, and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it. In a nutshell, I found it interesting, but not a satisfying plot and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyones ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating.#0
11580_10#As a another reviewer states Hannas War is an outstanding film about an outstanding person, Hanna  Anniko  Senesh, who would become the Jewish Joan Of Arc. Unfortunately I diverge in opinion not agreeing that Miss Detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces. Maruschka Detmers performance is brave, poignant, heartfelt or understood, and totally believable. In other words for me  In the zone.  from the opening credits. If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give Hannas War with Maruschka Detmers a try. My hat is off also to Ellen Burstyn as Hannas mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film. In that it is a team effort perhaps of two actress but not an All About Eve situation.#1
6300_8#I loved this film. I thought it would be easy to watch, and easy to forget. I ran out after watching this to buy the DVD, obv not easily forgotten! #1
10736_1#The movie starts quite with an intriguing scene, three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar. All of them are making up a bit outrageous stories. As the movie unfolds, it turns out that the most outrageous story is true. However, beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed. This revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly, not much is left to be seen. The rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken Russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies. Sure, these are fascinating and a bit shocking images, but admiring them goes on way too long, sacrificing any possible plot or character development. I found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie-making, where instead of trying to make an interesting story, movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories (case in point - meat traders story) to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends. On a surface it has artsy appearance, but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent.#0
4104_9#It helps if you understand Czech and can see this in the original language and understand the Czechs obsession with The Professionals, but if not, Jedna ruka netlaska is yet another great Czech film. It is funny, dark and extremely enjoyable. The highest compliment I can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing. I highly recommend this and most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved in. Enjoy it, its a film made for just that reason - anyway, its as close as the Czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending#1
8077_7#A movie made for contemporary audience. The masses get to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course sensuous scenes as well. This is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family. It isnt for eyes of children. I had to fast forward quite a number of scenes. If you dont care about the message, and all you want is an escape from worldly reality, this movie is an entertainer alright.#1
11087_4#Second-tier American leading man Guy Madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this Spaghetti Western  which, having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine (though featuring a nice enough score). The plot offers some mild interest the title, incidentally, refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun-runners on a ranch  the property of the family of their pursuer, cavalry agent Madison. The latters younger siblings are determined that the injured party, now in their charge, lead them to the gang boss responsible; ultimately, the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise  and both, ironically, become involved with one of Madisons sisters (another is raped during the raid). Euro-Cult starlet Rosalba Neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess, and Madisons ex-flame.#0
6413_7#Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook, and all the rest of the actors and actresses in  Men of Honour  have combined to make this a fine movie. Mark Isham wrote the filmscore, so you know the music is truly fine, too. Will Hollywood EVER realize that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their over-dramatic approach to story-telling? I doubt it. Too bad #1
3046_10#All good movies  inspire  some direct to video copycat flick. I was afraid that  Gladiator  wasnt really that good a film, because I hadnt seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything Roman on the new releases shelf for months. Then I spotted Full Moons latest offering, Demonicus. Im a fan of Full Moons Puppetmaster series, and Blood Dolls, but had never seen one of their non-killer puppet films. Anyway All trashing aside, I actually enjoyed this film. Not as much as a killer puppet film, perhaps, but Full Moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was there was no Full Moon Videozone at the end #1
5349_4#This straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moraniss career. As is the Disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in; this is a lazy retread with Moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer, which did nothing but make me pine for the days of The Incredible Shrinking Man, when this kind of thing was done properly. Shockingly, this is directed by top cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time.#0
9146_9#This electrifying musical has more than a whiff of egotism from its star, the musical genius that is Prince. The film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic. #1
11835_1#Oh if only I could give this rubbish less than one star! There were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it! one was where a line or two from the song Dont Worry, Be Happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where Roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin. That is it there was nothing more amusing than that, at least not for me anyway! Doctornappy2 is not right in saying Fans of the completely terrible  Shrek  might enjoy, but  Wallace & Gromit  fans will probably turn away in disgust. As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit. You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching, this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get! The continuity mistakes were too big in number. Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not. I wont point out all of the others, but here are a few more to see When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it. At one point the ruby falls down Roddys back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards. In the next scene Roddy has caught it again. This is impossible. Seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of Roddys shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in Roddys hand. There was a third one I wanted to point out but for now I have forgotten it. Too many, for want of a better word, jokes were repeated in one way or another, there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters, the characters were hollow, shallow and empty, and the whole film left you wanting.wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else! Paint drying or grass growing are two superb options #0
653_10# La Maman et la putain  is the beautifulest film of all time. And whats most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with, which is directly inspired by Prousts  A la Recherche du temps perdu . If, like Baudelaire says, an artiste tells  reality at the light of his dream , it is his nightmare that Eustache tells us in  La Maman et la putain .#1
6436_2#I am a kind person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was without a doubt the worst movie that Ive seen in a long time. There was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i.e. what Jesus may really have wanted us to know, were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine (Arquette). Total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience. The acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired. And, if I saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera, I may have started screaming louder than Patricia.#0
4376_9#Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. Its her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but its his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, youll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but its unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you do have to listen carefully if youre not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. Its their skill as actors that attracts you, they dont rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something special.#1
1968_8#So, every year there is at least one movie, that hasnt got any chance of being a box office success, because from the moment of production, even before one simple shot is filmed, everybodys picking on this movie There is a long list of these kind of movies, and in the end, some are really bad (Battlefield Earth (2000)), some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable (Catwoman (2004), Elektra (2005)) and then there are a few, which actually are really great for what they are, but no one admits! I mean, my gosh, just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on, not everybody has to join them. So yeaaah, maybe those movies arent perfect, but cmon, how many movies are? Not every movie is supposed to be a new The Lord of the Rings! Not everybody will enjoy these movies, but I bet there are more than who admit they do. Hudson Hawk (1991), who is just hysterical funny, Color of Night (1994), which may not be Oscar-worthy, but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists, Swept Away (2002), which I thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance, Gigli (2003), which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former  Bennifer -Couple, and this year its  Basic Instinct 2   Well, when I heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies I was very sceptically, and although I really love Sharon Stone I stayed sceptically until Ive finally seen this movie. And really, I was very positively surprised! I cant understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here. It never simply copies the original, it has a quite clever story, has tension, action, humor and the absolutely stunning Sharon Stone reprising the role of her life! With 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s, but its more than her being beautiful, its brilliantly acted, with all her looks, her famous smile, the way she speaks and moves from the very first frame shes in you cant take your eyes off of her. Its simply a pleasure to watch her as Catherine Tramell, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too! So I really cant see whats wrong with this movie it has a dark, thrilling, sexy and gritty look, strong performances, and you never felt bored! Maybe the story isnt Oscar-caliber, but it never even tries to be! Its an entertainment-movie, and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion! So give it a try #1
12215_10#I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/ actors style of directly addressing me/the audience very engaging. What I found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities, and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.#1
11235_4#One of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams, rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins. One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s. This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside, causing the material to wash downhill, where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment. The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries. The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas. Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields, where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult. Thus, the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner. First, we might ask why Warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor Technicolor, a very rare treatment in 1938. A story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time. The answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors, with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations. Then, we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero, to be paired with Olivia de Havilland. Among other things, this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it. Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes, in his small role, seemed unusually subdued. Unfortunately, I fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film. The portion I saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems. It needed to be more like  The Good Earth , released just the year before. Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man, such as Errol Flynn. Finally, there is the matter of the inane title. Surely, Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title.  Gold or Grain  is short and to the point. Incidentally, I understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills, waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining.#0
5864_1#I am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made. If you cant make a 13 year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever. Unfortunately Joan Rivers chose differently. The movie is full of predictable gags (some of these are racist) and very unfunny jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant (as I write this, I cannot believe this was actually a movie scene). The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is  I knew I should have been on top.  ha ha ha ha ah ugh ..#0
11375_9#This movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion. From the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator, youll be entranced. Its an absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great. Not overly done either. I recommend it for anyone interested in Russian history, too. How the police work with the political party being what it was It is truly fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. Its been a while since I saw this movie the first time. It doesnt diminish its impact. Not overly dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough to the imagination, well, youll see.#1
5694_4#Ill be honest- the reason I rented this movie was because I am a huge fan of Kyle Chandlers (most notably from Early Edition). Since he usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him as in a different role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also drew me in; a wanna-be hitman (Tony Greco- a.k.a. Mr. Chandler) must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life- or, rather, the death- of a witness who will testify against someone in  the family . The movies was nothing like I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, youd know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically- it was filthy, and made little sense. Yes, it was a mob movie, and yes the guns do go BOOM. But theres more to a movie than that. This film acted as if it didnt have the time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it. The acting really made up for it- James Belushi was pretty amusing as  The Rose . Sheryl Lee made Angel seem as believable as she could get. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to  the family . If only the script did justice to the actors.#0
3178_8#The film  Cross Eyed  by Adam Jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most. These truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them. The simple yet attractive settings costumes keep you guessing about what you will see next. You cant help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie. I cant wait for his sophomore effort. It is only a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Bravo #1
2854_3#Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now hes  fixed.  Lane is his girl whos been messing around with his Number One (Goldblum), whos supposed to have something going with Lanes sister (Barkin). 3 out of 10 stars.#0
604_1#I was so disgusted by this film, I felt obligated to warn off others. This film has no story, plot or hint of purpose. The film starts after the standard  lets be scary  movie intro, which by now every film watcher has become accustomed. So we can ignore the beginning completely. We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static. (Unless you have seen white noise - EEK) Acting is a DISGRACE and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came. Having said that, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able. Their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster. Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up  eccentric  writer, who probably considers himself to be an artist, has resulted in a film which will test your patience. It was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said,  We have been watching this for 45 mins  did I realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasnt the audience. Rather than suggest what the film is missing, let me tell you what it has Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise), Victims, bad-monster-guy-thing, about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours, days, weeks, months and credits. Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes, but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film #0
2005_3#Not that I was really surprised.movies are never as good as the books that they originated from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books, even though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they strayed from the books storyline too much, and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was. Ending was different too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery. The acting was unremarkable at best. Perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldnt have to stay so much in Lifetimes  made for TV movie  box, it would be a better flick. If you saw this movie I highly encourage you to track down the book and read it. I doubt youll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.#0
7771_9#The absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty Dane Douglas Sirk (born Detlef Sierck), Written on the Wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame. From its justly famous opening sequence, with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a Texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback, the movie compresses into its 99 minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later, little-screen knockoffs as Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest over their years-long runs. The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme Americans, in our dollar-based society, find irresistible. Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled, troubled heirs to the Hadly oil fortune; boyhood chum Rock Hudson and new bride Lauren Bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron. (Its been rumored that the story was based on Libby Holmanns marriage into Reynolds tobacco money.) As always, the misfits get all the scenery to chew -- and the best lines to spit out (Malone, in her Oscar-nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for Hudson, gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them). Hudson, while good, cant compete with all this over-the-top emoting; Bacall starts out strong but grows recessive, a mere plot convenience. No matter; with a succession of set-pieces shot in extravagant hues, Sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late-50s America. Nobody ever did it better.#1
6938_4#In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction on his invitation is rather weird. Is was supposed to be funny. I only like movies who really are funny. I suppose I will never watch this movie again.#0
5571_10#After viewing  Whipped  at a distributors screening at the AFM the other night, I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed. The audience was laughing all the way through. Unfortunately, every territory was already sold, so I did not have the opportunity to purchase the film, but I truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas. I agree with the comment that  Whipped  should not be pitched as a male  Sex and the City,  mainly because unlike  Sex and the City,   Whipped  is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously.  Whipped  pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldnt dare. Also, the film that I screened at the AFM had more of a plot and story than  Swingers,   Clerks,  and  Sex and the City  combined.  Whipped  never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non-stop comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid, which only made the film more impressive considering the budget.#1
7335_1#This is possibly the worst version of the play I have seen - several times on stage apart from the movie. My personal favourite pairing was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic performer, can act.#0
415_7#The master of movie spectacle Cecil B. De Mille goes West. Using three legends of the old west as its protagonists (they probably never met),Gary Cooper is portraying Wild Bill Hickock,James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur does make a nice Calamity Jane. The story serves only for De Mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on, like the big Indian attack.Scenes like that are extremely well done.If you dont mind the somewhat over-the-top performances of the cast this is an very entertaining western.Look out for a very young Anthony Quinn essaying the role of an Indian brave who participated at the battle of Little Big Horn.This part got him at least noticed in Hollywood.#1
5286_1#I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK just so I could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the U.S. I really should have saved my money. What is with Anne running after Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliots character is that she was quiet and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? Her speech wasnt normal, nor was her walking normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole  romance  completely unbelievable. In the final scene they even have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress Amanda Root wore during the letter scene. The same clothes do not make it the same movie. In my opinion they didnt watch the 1995 version, which even though it had its flaws, it did stay pretty close to the book. The book, I dont even think they read it. This is kind of like a Cliffs Notes movie of Persuasion. Hit on all the high points without explaining anything.#0
3399_3#Birthday Girl doesnt know what it wants to be - is it a comedy,, is it a dramait just doesnt know. What could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no-mans land. The premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out. This is a real shame if you look at the cast - its very solid all the way through but they dont get the chance to shine. Very disappointing.#0
6970_8#This is one of those Films/pilot that if you knew BattleStar Galactica it helps, but isnt necessary. What makes this even more believable of a story than BSG is that this isnt something so far away in the future. This has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically. The leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced & quite talented actors. Eric Stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re-united w/his daughter however real or not she is & hell do it no matter the cost. Paula Malcomson of  Deadwood  fame is terrific as his wife as well. You are not sure completely of his motives whether its love or money or both, but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in the making of Zoe played by the relative unknown Alessandra Torresani & her performance. Esai Morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again & just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections. I didnt think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone I am thrilled to see how we got to the BSG stage story. Its great to see Adama as a child already being affected & influenced by the different sorts of Robots starting to permeate life at this stage. I just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the Humanoid typed robots. This is an almost perfect pilot & I hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling. Even the Visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you havent gotten into BSG, @ least try this & Ill bet you become a fan & will want to see how the BSG story came to be.#1
577_8#This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The Footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. It also received an Oscar for best photography, and deservedly so. I have many movies in my film collection and several more Ive seen besides them, and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one. Its unique and an overall great movie. The cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters. We follow their destinies with devotion, and get very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think much of this film for what it represent, and how it present it. I warmly recommend it#1
6178_3#Frank Tashlins The Home Front is one of the more lifeless Private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military. Rather than have Snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster, The Home Front instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too. Snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy. Its a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead Tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily, extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief. The result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact.#0
3034_7#An underrated addition to the Graham Greene cinematic canon - its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues. Director Shumlin, theatrical director, frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a 40s thriller!), the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous (and possibly paedophiliac), brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the Spanish Civil War into jolting dangerous reality, has one horrific murder, an astonishing insights into class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of Greenes God, and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history.#1
5921_7#I was the Production Accountant on this movie, and I also got to do some voice-over work on it, so Im not entirely unbiased, but if it were awful, I would say so. I thought it was a fun film, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, by any means, but there were plenty of laughs along the way. The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine, so watching this movie could be good for your health. So many of the actors in this picture hadnt yet reached their peak at the time we made this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, is one who has since gone on to much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the  Thirty-Something  TV drama series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still haunting peoples dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedic actor, and a truly nice, sincere person. We all had fun working on this show, and I think that fun comes through.#1
8218_1#I never finished this movie for a reason, it was dreadful and thats just the acting. I wasnt even sure what the film was about tbh it didnt make a lot of sense and the violence was awful. I mean ususally i like some nude in a film (lol) but it was just sick because of what was happening. ALL the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities. This is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please. i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone or even consider it. (N)#0
4652_9#I think this movie is well done and realistic. I you are used to watching Hollywood  action  movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what lifts it above the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the  making of  extra Im convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie i will recommend for others to watch. High quality realistic story and movie.#1
8537_4#This movie got off to an interesting start. Down the road however, the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals. The male lead was very good , even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax. In comparison, this is  Boomerang  meets  Extremities .#0
5198_7#What can be said about Mr. Moore? Hes the godfather of rap, hes the king of the Z-level blaxploitation flicks, and here, he is back as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This movie is one whacked-out roller-coaster ride of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence, and a whole lot of other stuff youd never find in most modern movies (or any movies, really, haha!). The stand-up routine he gives early on is not to be missed! At any rate, D2 is definitely an entertaining way to waste an hour or so. Dolemite  He think hes bad and aint got no class! Im gon rock this shotgun up his  beep  a  !  #1
20_1#This movie was terrible. at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so i watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. i feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago.. Ive watched it at least 20 times. i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies.#0
3606_9#I really enjoyed Girl Fight. It something I could watch over and over again. The acting was Fantastic and i thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film. Very convincing might I say. The movie is showing how women should stand up for what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time. Dealing with a ignorant dad didnt really help her much. Even though he loved her he was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in the role. The love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also. I felt the passion the y had for one another. Then again drama sets in and then its like she is choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream. I thought it ended just right. It was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for them.For all you people who likes a movie based on a sport with a good plot i d suggest that you check this one out#1
7449_10#This show is awesome! and Ive seen it about 6 times. Granted it may be lacking in educational content as some people like those sort of movies, but I think its great, very funny and excellently written!#1
8337_3#Millie is a sap. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him cheating on her and divorces himbut lets him keep the kid she claims to love. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easywith no supportwhat a sap! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow, does she have a hard time picking men. Overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like  Madam X  but much, much less focused. So often Millies motivations and actions seem to make little sense. And, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs. Unusual but not particularly good.#0
9545_7#I dont know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of   Tetsuo   or not . Why   Tetsuo   ? Because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious   Tetsuo   rip - off . The concept is similar , editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because , aside from making the movie more dynamic , it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors . 7 out of 10 .#1
11947_4#An interesting change from the first one. there was more mystery to this movie then the first. Even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer. There are some good parts through the movie, the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up. All up the movie is enjoyable. The story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film, Norman Bates is out of an asylum and back to the Bates motel, but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother, things start going wrong. Perkins plays an aged Norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent, he swang that spade awfully hard.#0
5121_10#I am a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger performed at higher than average rates, I think the sets were representative of the location and the era, I liked the sound track and the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and Gilleys had low ceilings--perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a  smoke-filled bar  hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The Camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dancing, the low-level of light that actually was in the bar! What a feat! Sure there was auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low-light shots. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was outstanding! He got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film. Thanks, Ray--Great work #1
3409_1#Rumor has it that when the NASA Technical Advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you are a politician or work/crew the shuttle, you are not going to get in the shuttle. Furthermore, Space (Cadet) Camp is in Alabama, not Florida. This is the most useless film of all time, and it was a well deserved flop.#0
6976_4#Robert Altmans downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughtons book  McCabe  was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. Aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here dont merit much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and Altmans pacing is deliberately slow. Theres hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. Its a self-defeating picture, and yet, in an Altman-quirky way, it wears defeat proudly.    from     #0
11434_7#A lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80s music. This epitomizes the 80s desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work. Personally I liked Greensleeves and the other harsher characters. They had some of the more amusing lines.#1
9174_9#There have been many film and TV productions of Jane Eyre each with aspects to recommend them, but I suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now. Its just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others do). Timothy Dalton is utterly in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the mark; his performance is astonishingly nimble and many-colored, while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character. Zelah Clarkes Jane is more cerebral than otherworldly, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (who, appropriately, towers over her!) The nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing (once youve absorbed the shock of Daltons charisma). There are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the BBCs standards of that time. But, its the performances that are the real pleasure. Dont miss this one!#1
4982_4#Where to begin? Anachronism? High tech cross bow with a scope in about 500AD? Arrows with explosive charges in 500AD? A monster Grendel that looks like a robocop and obviously never interacts with any of the weapons fired or swung against him? The heart torn out of his victims chest without any sense of contact? Possibly the blond who would fit in on a recent fashion show with her make-up and streaked hair? The ancient Danish court represented in Classical Greek style? The queen played by Marina Sirtis more savaged by her makeup artist than by madness? The effects are way too weak to carry this story. There are some stories that dont mind or even benefit from cheap effects, but this Grendel isnt one of them.  This Beowulf has little to recommend it as traditional myth or as modern fantasy. I give it a 4 higher than it deserves, but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently. In the meantime, Sci-Fis movie-making seems to be following the NASA policy that its better to build lots of probes that fail than a few that succeed.#0

1094_9#This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct prigs. There is neither here, unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid. If youve ever thought of or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process, no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel, you are not alone!#1
351_10#Its a colorful slasher movie. Thats about it. --MB#1
2171_1#This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Woods impassioned defense of cross-dressing in  Glen or Glenda?  Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.#0

11357_10# Citizen X  is the superbly told true story of the hunt for one of historys worst serial killers. What makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place; the Soviet Union in the 1980s.  More important, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy. This was a made-for-cable movie by HBO Films and they have become a great resource for films that would otherwise never be made.#1
85_10#I saW this film while at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dream-like quality. The bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner, a little boy, is away at school. A cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are, and begins to warily stalk his  prey.  The boy begins his walk home from school, and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend. The fish becomes agitated by the cats presence, and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly walks over to the fish, gently picks him up with his paws, and returns him to his bowl. The boy returns happily to his fish, none the wiser. If you can find it, watch it -- you wont be disappointed! And if you  do  find it, let me know so I can get a copy, too #1
4804_2#I do not watch much television and came across this show. Reality show? I sure hope this is not for real. If I was a man and had such a nag and was married to someone so snotty, It would be grounds for divorce. I think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love. That is one thing that is wrong with our world now, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love another. It is self sacrificing and not something that should be on merritt. That does not give one a very good feeling, to watch what should be in private counseling. If his personality on the show is for real, then he deserves someone much better that would show real true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this show a reality or made up for ratings???? I really would like to know. Sincerely, GB#0
1725_8#Playing out as a sort of pre runner to The Great Escape some 13 years later, this smashing little British film plays it straight with no thrills and dare do well overkill. First part of the movie is the set up and subsequent escape of our protagonists, whilst the second part concentrates on their survival whilst on the run as they try to reach Sweden. The film relies on pure characters with simple, effective, and yes, believable dialogue to carry it thru, and it achieves its aims handsomely. No little amount of suspense keeps the film ticking along, and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the time frame it adheres to, so a big thumbs to the film that may well be the first of its type ?. 7/10#1
1328_10#Without  mental anachronism , this film which I would like to find in DVD offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the  disenchantment of the world . That, there is thirty years, a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding. It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included/understood, analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of  primitive thought . Because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior, that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance. If somebody knows where I then to get a numerical copy or VHS to me or DVD thank you in advance.#1
6387_3#When I first picked this film up I was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. Im a fan of animation and love it when its successfully merged with live action footage. However, the animation in this film was about all I enjoyed. Although it must be said that the actors performances were excellent. The visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece. However this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery, both visual and in the script, that you were practically hammered over the head with. Most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot. It seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece. The voice overs from Felisberto - especially the one at the end - very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing (and even that wasnt properly addressed). Im afraid the whole piece came across as, at best, a reasonable first attempt, by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all.#0
9556_4#This movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects. It is very weak on plot. Most of the computer talk was just mumbo-jumbo. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology. This movie had none of that. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame. It is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers. The ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point? Movie was boring. Lame sequel.#0
10804_10#Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning. First Pachelbels Canon brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowes name hooked me completely. I was entranced by this film, Crowes performance (again), the subject matter (and yes, what a debt we owe), how various matters were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons, too), the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, Crowes recitation of High Flight. I wont spoil the film for anyone, but, separated from my wife by 4,000-odd miles, as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot, I admit to crying heartily a couple of times. Buy it, rent it, download it, beg, borrow or steal it - but watch it. PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colours)on the ground? Looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 Brownings in a dorsal turret.#1
891_2#Having loved Paris, Je Taime, I highly anticipated this film and I admit I went in with high expectations, but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons. Maybe if I had gone into it without having Paris looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response, but as a self-titled re-take of Paris, Je Taime I was sorely disappointed.#0
2170_9#I think that that creator(s) of this films concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received. It isnt an Oscar caliber film of course, but, at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it back in 1984 (in the theatre).  Thats just my opinion anyway. o)#1
327_3#Even if youre a huge Sandler fan, please dont bother with this extremely disappointing comedy! I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover). Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. Im not sure what point this was in Sandlers career, but Im guessing it was even before his SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of his home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol timesbut we (the audience) are left to dry. This is hardly a  movie   Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is  no-budget  movie (thats right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie). So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, its like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience. And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line  Take my wife, please  and the audience is on the floor? Im not even going to TRY to make any logic here. Sure, Sandlers current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in  Billy Madison,  the midget in  Happy Gilmores  Happy Place) but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if youre curious about Adams early days in film--you still wont be interested. Youre better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in  Mixed Nuts.  Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane ( Titanic ) has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the  Rocky  movies) has a significant role.  My score 3 (out of 10)#0
10366_1#These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that. Then, reaching 70th minute I was convincing myself that its only a few more minutes, and I lasted to the very end which Im kinda proud of as I consider watching this movie as a great test for humans patience and crap tolerance. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try and if youre strong willed enough, you may even last to the end The movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all. All happenings in the movie, you can be sure you saw somewhere before, and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel.#0
8608_9#This was a great movie with a good cast, all of them hitting on all cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is at her best, well, it just doesnt get any better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always underrated, was even better. He should be a star.  One of the other commentators said the movie had a  political agenda . That is a baffling thing to say. There was no politics at all in this movie.#1
11434_2#This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. You should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here, there are SPOILERS. Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin (Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh). Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister; living together in everyone elses eyes as man and wife. No sex but just about everything else. Early on, the movie starts with its theme the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions. Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch. Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him, she does it and gets to the nitty-gritty questions too. When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date. Charlie (Bridget Moynahan) is the girl of THEIR dreams, like all the right things etc Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal! That Charlie accepts! In one week Charlie, Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas. In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns (apparently Charlie has an off-the-rack figure). Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a $10,000 frock for her. While Charlie is zipping her in this down-payment-on-a-house gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte (I swear it was like a feed bag). What should happen but woops  latte all over the gown. It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdales bridal salon with out a $10,000 mocha colored gown. Back to reality  Caesars palace Las Vegas. They have the high roller room (Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money?) Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drink-a-thon were, you guessed it - they kiss. Gray remembers everything; Charlie remembers nada. They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line  If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds  Gray gets the hiccups. Gray excuses herself, for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again hiccups. Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets, literally. And of course one is you guessed it again! Gay. The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver (Alan Cummings) named Gordy. He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned. They become great friends. This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss. He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment. When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office. Gray works at an ad agency. This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone. It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency. Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a not-so-private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office. This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar. Sorry no men says the bouncer. So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag. Bad drag. He was in a sleeveless black satin-like blouse, a string of pearls, and a grandmas church hat. No lesbian would ever confuse this man in a dress as a drag queen much less a woman. The bar was also the straight mans fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of Victorias Secret models. Everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firms client. Gray happens to be on the womans account and finally does more then kiss. For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with Gray, but that is for the sequel.#0
11910_1#What is interesting is that the acting; was not bad, just not enough. It was rather lame., special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure. Standing alone they werent horribly bad, but put together was a tragic move. The show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along, but it failed totally. Much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects.Dont believe it, they were kinda cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. Though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton. An experienced actress would have brought something to the part, like Appleby never did. Scfi puts out some really good original movies, its just too bad that this failed so drastically.#0
10952_10#Sarah Silverman is a dangerous Bitch! Shes beautiful, sexy, funny and talent, dark and demonic. I read the other comment on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just dont get it. Nothing that appears on T.V. is an accident. Too much money, time and work is put into the production of a T.V. show for there to be mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid. This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile. I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre. Its a lot like Pee-Wees Playhouse for maladjusted, slacker twenty-something glue sniffing, Future Pornstars of America from the Valley. The cast is awesome. The scenarios and action is well-paced. I hope this show succeeds since Comedy Central didnt let David spade keep his show. Who plays Sarahs sister? She not in the cast listing on the shows home page. I would love to see her stand-up. Does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or DVDs that may be floating around out there?#1
7487_1#Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. The couple having sex in the park. They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie & Steve do a bit of slap stick. The whole movie winds up being like thisa joke is set up and given away. Why isnt Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. You will also notice every close up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, thats if you want to laugh.#0
10431_1#I loved the first season. The quality went down a little bit in the second season, which however had a great middle (Pegasus!). Third season was fairly novel and original and was OK. Fourth season started going downhill fast, because they never even began giving us any explanations, when by now we were really starting to need them. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of Angel-Kara leading the fleet to a devastated Earth-1? What kind of a past did the last five Cylons have, and how did they survive, or were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. 1 out of 10.#0

10548_7#Director Vincenzo Natali first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film  Elevated , wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building. His follow-up feature project  Cube , released later that year, had a very similar premise, this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps. Both were admirable attempts to take the sci-fi genre a step further, by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation, choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element, how the characters act, react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions. After his exploration into the mainstream with 2002s  Cypher , Natali has come back to his bizarre character-film trend to bring us  Nothing , his latest, and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of  What If?  In all fairness,  Nothing  is an impressive piece of work in many ways. The concept is interesting, the direction is inventive, the script works on a human level and, most of all, it shows a progression in Natalis creative mentality. For fans of his work, this will be a delight, and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time. Its just a shame that the directors fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great, fun film it could have been.#1
1631_1#Please humour me if you will, for a minute while I read you the back of the ALLEY CAT VHS box. It says that Which kinds of begs the question, is this an exploitation film, or a serious drama? Neither, is my response to that.. it isnt sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of Troma-style cinema, and it certainly doesnt make the grade as an exploration of one womans fight against the system.. purely because it is so appallingly made. So who on earth would want to see it? Lunatics, I guess.. or IMDb reviewers who stay up till 3pm and watch any old rubbish on the box while trying to get to sleep. Sadly on this occasional I failed, and the horrors will stay with me for quite some time. Dont make the same mistake I did. Have a hot milk, or something.. 1/10#0
9550_7#Despite of the success in comedy or drama, the Turkish directors are failure in horror-thriller.  Okul-D@bbe  are good examples for the awful horror Turkish films. As a result  Gen  does not add any difference to horror movies, but it does not disappoint thriller fans. In this respect it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)#1
10027_1#The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is hilarious. Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I cannot see anything positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write. The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan. I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero.#0
5468_7#I handt seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of  Baby Face  with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, shes been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and hes killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city ( New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in great style! This is pre-code Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect. This reminded me of  Original Sin  with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like Baby FAce any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will love it. Highly recommended! See it #1
850_8#THE MATADOR (2005)     _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a mid-life crisis while on assignment in Mexico where he befriends a square yet likable American businessman (Kinnear at his most affable) and discovers there is more to life than death. Newbie filmmaker Richard Shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath-of-fresh-air into the buddy comedy formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing Brosnan to get his ya-yas out with devilish glee. A sleeper gem indie hit.#1
2567_3#Annoying, static comedy with a painfully miscast Peter Sellers as a smarmy, self-centered Casanova who always has his way with the ladies. A major blemish on Sellers filmography, and, even worse, a film that seems to have been made solely to satisfy the ego of its star. ( )#0
3325_7#OK, I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie. I cant recall ever watching one. I also dont recall watching a Jimmy Fallon movie. Alright, I did watch taxi, but I said penance and was forgiven for that mistake. But, this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she is the cutest thing. I dont know what it is about her, but I just smile the whole time I am watch her. She just captivates me that way. I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates. How sad is that? This wasnt the greatest baseball movie - it wasnt supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for. It had a predictable ending, but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile.#1
9965_10#Perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing, albeit, completely corny, to adults. Not a bad film for a low-budget job. Children will be amazed with Santas workshop and the  magic  that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small, or homes that have no chimneys at all! #1
9160_8#In all the comments praising or damning Daltons performance, I thought he was excellent. He does not play Rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy, but as a roguish, powerful man. I liked this version, although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting, and the scenes with Jane and St. John never quite gelled. I give this an 8.#1
10556_10#I wasnt sure what to expect but am I glad I went to see this. A smart, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I wasnt quite sure how a director can create  nothing , but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals at C.O.R.E. to create another low budget set that looks real (as real as nothing can be). Well worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. Youll be glad you did.#1
7585_3#I love watching early colour films - you mean those 40s clothes werent all grey?  Just because all the actors are English (apart from Cummings), the Americans feel they have to use the words  Brit ,  stiff ,  lip  and  upper . Oh, give it a rest! The three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks (Did he make love to you? Yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).#0
6561_4#The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into  horizon blue  and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right.#0
6880_7#You know what they say about the 70s..if you can remember them you werent there. One of the few things I do remember about the 70s was the very first hippie and hip social satire as seen from a totally undergroundor counter-culture perspective..The Groove Tube. If the humor seems faded or witless now to some viewers it can only be because a lot has happened in the last 30 years and the comedy isnt fresh anymore..but hey! When this movie came out it was a first..and some of these skits were being done for the very first timeat a time when Nixon was in office, the Vietnam war was raging, the sexual revolution was in full swing..and J.Edgar Hoover was still in charge of the FBI. This is a film made before Watergate broke and as such it was one of the first to take a big swipe at the establishment..to make fun of it and the hippies at the same time. And frankly, some skits are still dead funny. If you liked Cheech and Chongs  Up In Smoke ..you will LOVE this film. Take it for what it is..a memento of the timesand a sassy little film that will help all of us who did forget the 70s to remember them anew.#1
8433_9#The acting in this movie was superb, but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa made it heart wrenching. It was good that the writer isolated Boesman and Lena from others run from their homes, so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats; the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart. Worth seeing when you put the movie in its proper context.#1
6399_1#One Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid. Theyve both sold themselves out in this one, worse than Pryors character. Two Horrible, overly sentimental script that could have been used in a Harold Lloyd movie its so cliched. Three Choice of a black actor as the toy; the racial subtext of this is unbearable, as its never addressed. Theres no message here, Pryors part could have been played by any comedic actor. Four That kidI wish I could go back in time and prevent him from ever actingthat would mean movies like this one and Kid Co. might not have been madeand my childhood would have been free of their mind-warping power. So if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick, go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, see Pryors old standup act and Gleason in something better, like the Honeymooners.#0
1923_4#Ironic that Dr. Seuss fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed, and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The general gist of Ron Howards adaptation is that the Grinchs bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones animated version. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether its the dialogue, the pacing, or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot, the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly. There are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs theres an element or two here thats missing. Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. If you must see the feature-length version, rent it on video with Jones animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better. I give this film three cans of Who-Hash out of five.#0
4385_9#What can one say about a film that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic, and occasionally most weirdly -I wont say sympathetic..I will say charismatic villains in the history of the Cinema, and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heyday? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender, and sensual.#1
10249_7#This is the first out of the Guinea Pig series, and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection. Overall I think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it, but I suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one.#1
2547_1#I havent seen it in over twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the kidnapper. There are better movies from the seventies like this to check out.#0
8932_9#The film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. It doesnt present a series of pretty pictures. Instead it is a visually interesting film. It forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots. This sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at. The film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the less than fully engaged viewer get whats going on. Instead the film touches on and moves through a number of different genres. The trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness. I suspect 99% of North American viewers will just not get it. If you try to pin down the narrative of this film, or the philosophical message, or the symbolist structure, etc. you will waste your time. There are none of these. The film only feints towards these genres and others at times. The only unifying force in the film is Claire Deniss own sense of what fits together. There are so few feature length films that come close to satisfying Kants description of what art is, namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself instead of simply subsuming experiences under concepts. Film usually takes the easy way out and opts for the simpler pleasure of understanding whats happening. Most film is not art. Most film doesnt come close to art. When a film does, as this one does, and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewers, its something of a miracle. My on negative comment is that at times I find the film too simplistically buying in to the various narrative threads that run through it. The Tahiti father-son narrative, even though its not exactly conventional, ends up making things a little to clear and simple. It dominates too much.#1
9131_3#I can hardly believe I watched this again last night after more than 25 years As I said, a shame and a real waste of all that talent, including that of Peter Sellers (who played both Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (whod been in a Chris Lee Fu film in his time), Helen Mirren (the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half-hour of the film!). I begin to wonder if anyone will EVER make a  proper  Fu Manchu film, or if fans will have to settle for Karloffs being almost the ONLY one?#0
11128_10#First I would like to say how great this. It is astounding and sometimes shocking. And to say the least Im 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring film, but this is anything but boring. It is like a trip through humanity. Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico RATSO Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent. Ratso becomes Joes manager but soon both men cant find Joe a job which results in stealing food. As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is. They cant get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratsos dream spot, Florida. The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life.#1
3720_2#Is this film a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it isnt a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor, but on quite a few occasions the poor acting, poor directing, and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake. The killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this film though, unless you are studying how NOT to act, direct or script a film!#0
5163_7#An unusual take on time travel instead of traveling to Earths past, the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet. They beam down to this planet, whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours (thats cutting it close!). In some kind of futuristic library, they meet Mr. Atoz (A to Z, get it? ha-ha) and his duplicates. It turns out, instead of escaping their planets destruction via space travel, the usual way, the inhabitants have all escaped into their planets various past time eras. Mr. Atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection (check out the discs we see here, another Trek prognostication of CDs and DVDs!). When Mr. Atoz prepares the machine (the Atavachron-what-sis), gallant Kirk hears a womans scream and runs into the planets version of Earths 17th century, where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery. Theres an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time, using phrasing of the time ( youre a bully fine coo.. Witch! Witch! Theyll burn ye! ). Spock & McCoy follow Kirk, but end up in an ice age, 5000 years earlier. Kirk manages to get back to the library first. The real story here is Spocks reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors, the warlike Vulcans of 5000 years ago. This doesnt really make sense, except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change (even so, Spock & McCoy werent prepared by Atoz - oh, well; it also seems to me Spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from millions of light years away, instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical Vulcan). In any case, Spock really shows his nasty side here - forget  Day of the Dove  and remember  This Side of Paradise  - McCoy quickly finds out that his Vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged. Spock also gets it on with Zarabeth, a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment (a couple of Trek novels were written about Spocks son, the result of this union). All these scenes are eye-openers, a reminder of just how much Spock conceals or holds in. Its also ironic that, only a few episodes earlier ( Requiem for Methuselah ), McCoy was pointing out to Spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens. Kirk, meanwhile, tussles with the elderly Atoz, who insists that Kirk head back to some past era ( You are evidently a suicidal maniac  - great stuff from actor Wolfe, last seen in  Bread and Circuses ). It all works out in the end, but, like I mentioned earlier, they cut it very close. A neat little Trek adventure, with a definite cosmic slant.#1
1717_3#Here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel, poverty riddled existence Robin Hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times. Gad! According to this crap Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the Missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who didnt really want to hurt anybody.he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them.

6857_10# Dressed To Kill , is one of the best thrillers ever made. Its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults. Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialog, and he tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his visuals, and Pino Donnagios brilliant score. Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be seen in widescreen, as De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story. Cropped, on video,  Dressed To Kill , is barely the same movie. Solid performances from its cast, superb direction, and, perhaps, the finest film score ever written, make  Dressed To Kill  a must see.#1
5246_10#This film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy. While I found that world morally repulsive, the film did best what storytelling should do, and that is take us through an experience that we would otherwise never undergo. Tim Meadows so convincingly portrays Leon Phelps, and the story so drew me into the reckless world of Leon, that I momentarily forgot that I was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it. Herein lies the films undoing because its great and bold achievement in storytelling comes at the price of its own success. Understanding that the vast majority of moviegoers will respond only to the story of this film that lies on the surface, and reject that story, I hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that I loved it. I loved it not only for its fascinating insights into the deluded mind of the playboy, not only for its amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the human sex drive, but also for its courage to fearlessly explore what is in the shadows of heterosexuality. Besides, its just funny.#1
5698_8#Val Kilmer Love or loath him, sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go Hey! This guy is a GREAT actor  He did in the leather pants of Jim in The Doors and hes done it again in the leather underpants of John. What Kilmer does so effortlessly is exhude the low-life of the celebrity, the do anything to anyone craving that overwhelms anyone who had it and then lost it. Go see him, youll know what I mean.#1
8762_1#A scientist (John Carradine--sadly) finds out how to bring the dead back to life. However they come back with faces of marble. Eventually this all leads to disaster. There are some good things about this Carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. And there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane walking through walls. Theres also one of the worst-looking knockouts in cinema history. Still, none of this is fun enough to sit through this. Avoid.#0
11099_4#The main problem with the documentary  Czech Dream  is that isnt really saying what it thinks its saying. Im not saying that the movie isnt gripping - something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action - but, when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red-faced and empty-handed to their homes, we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed.#0
9074_1#Yet another venture into the realm of the teen-gross-out-comedy, set on a college campus featuring a nerds quest to coolness, and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks into making him get the girl. Its all been done before, and its all been done in a far more satisfying manner. The gross-out humor that has made teen flicks like  American Pie  and  Dude! Wheres my Car  so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment, appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove. The film is badly written, and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable. I wont even dignify this terrible picture by divulging, as its a waste of my time and yours. At best, Slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter, and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable.  Jason Schwarzman, who impressed in his debut Rushmore, humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast. Please avoid, please avoid. Save your money.#0
10292_7#Let me start out by saying Im a big Carrey fan. Although Ill admit I havent seen all of his movies  cough the magestic cough . Bruce Almighty was enjoyable. None of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end, I dont know what the writers were thinking. Somehow I couldnt help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re-creating Liar Liar. On a positive note, The Daily Shows Steve Correl is HILARIOUS and so is the rest of the cast. See Bruce Almighty if youre a big Jim Carrey fan, or if you just want to see a light-hearted (que soft piano music) somewhat funny comedy.#1
4997_2#but its certainly not without merit. Already writer-director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. (No wonder the Coen brothers next movie is going to be an homage to Sturges.) If youre new to Preston Sturges, check out  The Lady Eve  or  Sullivans Travels  or  The Miracle of Morgans Creek  first. If youve seen these already, then go ahead and watch this one.#0

5138_10#Back in 1994, I had a really lengthy vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents house a lot. Way to go, FX.#1
5705_3# National Treasure  (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy cliché that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a national treasure that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a Stanley Goodspeed regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures. The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted  just the thick-headed.#0

8326_1#This is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller Ive ever seen. Oh.where to start. Enjoy#0
3631_7#The movie actually has a fairly good story, but gets bogged down in several key places. Its almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a fairly decent job in his role but something is clearly missing from several key scenes. #1
767_3#This should not have been listed as a Colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other Colombo ever made. This should have been listed as a movie starring Peter Falk and not playing the caracter of Colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant Colombo.#0
5585_1#The problem is the role of the characters in the film. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to Scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet given such a shallow, stereotypical role within the film The kidnapper (british anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film because he manages to relate to the pygmies No notion of how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their ordeal I find it is a shallow film, with a one sided fundamentally racist view it never manages to move away from the white mans view#0
2454_10#Cinematography--Compared to The Wrestler, a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer, and then hypnotizes as well. The director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither, emphasizing the development of Aicha as an individual who became a champion, not so much in the ring, but to all those around her. Even her worst . . . I will stop here to avoid the spoiler.#1
8490_3#This was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above its low budget trappings. The use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget I guess. I just wish the story and most of the acting was better. There are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they dont. Confusing and unbelievable story. Bad DVD transfer too. It doesnt take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. This I had to shut off. It was too boring. I can do slow movies. But just make them appealing in some aspect. Visually, story-wise, acting, etc. This was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience. Maybe the film makers next attempt will be better.#0
5619_3#Let me start by saying that I totally agree with the basic thesis of the film, that there probably was no historical Jesus and Christianity is a sham. With that said, this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis. It makes good arguments--the gap between Jesus theoretical life and the writing of the Gospels, filled only by the writings of Paul, who doesnt indicate a historical Jesus--and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them. It makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on, and it resolutely ignores counter-arguments presented by Christian apologists. The intellectual dishonesty, emotional manipulation, and lack of serious argument are obvious, and stunning. The only Christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmakers old school--who comes off like a reasonable, rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder--and various Christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot. Im sorry, but revealing that average Christians dont know much about their religion isnt exactly damning evidence of Christianitys fraudulence. You may as well claim that Jay Leno has disproved the existence of Michael Dukakis on his Jay-Walking segment. The interviews with experts can be interesting, but the film is filled with too much of, lets be honest, the filmmaker just being snarky. Within the first five minutes the film has already conflated Jerry Falwell with Charles Manson and the writers of the Left Behind series with the Branch Davidians. And by the end, the film becomes so self-centered that theres no rational argument left, just an angry former Christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood. Yknow, maybe that movie couldve been interesting, but its misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of Jesus, and its so self-congratulatory as to deflate any sympathy. This is a Michael Moore film without the humor or the film-making acumen combined with a Richard Dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor. Skip it.#0
6427_3#so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless. i know it got awards and things, but i personally did not enjoy it too much. there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested, just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs. some of the people in are rather different which isnt a bad thing, it just didnt leave a good impression on me. i was thoroughly bored by this movie, no offense to my creative writing teacher. the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didnt get it, and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing. the green animals thing was neat, i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers, but how did these four jobs connect? it just didnt make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that. But if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it. who am i to stand in your way. I am just forewarning you about possible suffering.#0
9934_3#As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, as this film is very of its age, in the 1960s. To me (someone born in the 1980s) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap, but I am sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during th 60s. I expected drugs galore with th Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, So much so I felt as if I was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. I have not seen any of the directors other films, but I suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of amatuerish which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value. My only good opinion of this is that I didnt waste money on it, it came free with a Sunday paper.#0
7930_7#Ill be honest. I got this movie so I could make fun of it. I mean, come on,  Hood of the Living Dead ? What other reaction could I have? The thing is, though, the movie (and its makers) decided that it wasnt going to be made fun of. Instead, it was going to try its best to be a good movie. Kudos to the Quiroz brothers. Id love to see what they do next. And hey, somebody, give them a budget #1
8954_4#I had high hopes for this movie, because I enjoyed the book so much. However, I dont think I would have understood the premise of the movie if I hadnt already read the book. The movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule, but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly. The corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed. Orwells dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since Ive read the book, but one hears references to Big Brother, the Thought Police, and Newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation. Probably many people using these terms dont realize where the terms came from. I strongly recommend that you read the book.#0
2465_10#A lot of people dont think Branaghs Hamlet film is all that good, but I must admit I think it is splendid. Like virtually every production of Shakespeare, it has problems and it has had to make hard choices, not all of which work out. The thing about the  secret doors everywhere , for instance, simply doesnt work. That element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to, which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming. This is the biggest problem with this production. And while its a biggie, Im also inclined to say that its the only problem. Almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully. All right, so Branagh is a mite too old for the title role. And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced. And he gets too hysterical at times. But thats it. No other complaints. Even with these faults, I think this version is a seminal one, and if its not as powerful a drama as it ought to be, its every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be. We get the complete text of the longest version of the play, innovatively and expensively brought to the screen, mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices - even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with. But in a staging of Shakespeare, it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language. For that, one must delve into the print versions of the plays. And so, 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous Hamlet.#1
8771_7#ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting Irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) went around claiming that he  could beat any man alive.  Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen. Summing up Maintains interest all the way through, whether youre a sports fan or not.#1
938_1#I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity I turned the channel. The original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for Adam West and Burt Ward. Put these two  actors  in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad.#0
2861_1#I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better. The acting, the music drowning out the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie all the way through b c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines. I never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered. What did that have to do with the  real  BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors actresses in this movie. The script would have turned me away within the first page of reading. You would be better off watching paint dry.#0
6055_8#I was not expecting much from this movie, but was very pleasantly surprised, as it is light and funny and very well observed. The central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug-centred trip to Wales. The humour was gentle and subtle, as indeed were the three characters (witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper). The atmospherics of rural Wales were captured perfectly, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Cleverly and carefully scripted, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture - I felt I was there with them. Very light in touch and full of fun - not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A delight on all fronts, and difficult to criticise, though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But overall, an unexpected treasure of a film.#1
7734_10#I saw this film a few years ago and I got to say that I really love it.Jason Patric was perfect for this weird role that he played.The director?I dont too many things about himand I dont care.The screenplay is good,thats for sure.In just a few words I have to say about this movie that is weird,strange,even dark,but its a good one.I saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then.I want to see it again and again.I know that Im not gonna get sick of watching it.The scenes,the atmosphere,the actors,the storyeverything is good.The movie should have lasted longer.I think 120 minutes should have been perfect.I was hoping for a part 2 for this movie.Too bad it dint happened.Jason Patricyoure the man ! very good movie. the end. -)#1
8351_9#I remember hitch hiking to Spain at 25, getting a lift from, what turned out to be, two fleeing Italian small crooks. They were doing a lot outside the law, but from the other side carrying a little portrait of Jesus in the pocket for their protectionJust and unjust, good and bad, criminal and correct where here in a new combination, outside of the categories I used to know. Les Valseuses gives me, although a film and not real life, a picture close to my own experiences the intenseness of each moment as soon as you leave all behind and go for the momentous, whatever comes your way, its another state of mind and also dangerous form of life, because, as we all know, there are people who are not ready for this and willing to persecute you for stealing and so onThis film touches values, its a story about whats right and wrong morals. Its resurrection of the individual fighting him/ herself free against the false morals and conformismTheres danger all the way, because, how far can you go with your own freedom and crossing your own moral borders and that of other people? What to do with people who are willing to hurt you, put you in jail or even shoot at you for the things that you do, like  stealing  some petrol from a multinational oil company for you fifth hand car? Les Valseuses re-awakens these questions in me, because morality, in contradiction to the usual media message, is quite complex#1
6303_8#Having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer I had to see this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present it had to be good. And it delivered. Overall, the movie is not crack-you-up funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is, in a my eyes, a classic. SPOILER At the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see Rockwell and Washington stare at Jeter is just fantastic. This is just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude is using a chair to barricade his door, but forgets the door turns outward! END SPOILER Just go see this movie, you wont be disappointed.#1
8892_2#Have to admit, this version disgraces Shakespeare upfront! None can act except the nurse who was my fav! Juliet had good skills as a teen but she cant give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her. Shes worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potiongod stop whining! I would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up! Anthony Andrewsyikes! Considering his other great movies (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), hes quite a shocker in this one. And dont get me started on Romeopuhleasssssee! Its still good to see if youre on the hunt to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of film. Olivia and Leonards version is still the best, followed by Leslie Howards version and then the current Leo and Clare!#0
1372_7# Party Girl  capitalizes on the tremendous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, at times, the movie seems to be a vehicle in which Ms. Posey is allow to play herself, as she normally is in real life. Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. Its because of Parker Posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the cast is good.#1
12045_2#Hello there, Alex#0
10971_2#How Irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me. Overacted by the usual band of Irish actors dragged out for every Irish movie. Terrible script, with forced character quirks (the brown sauce). Romanticising all that is bad about Dublin. The attitude of ah, its a dump but sure isnt it great all the same. Plenty of tidbits purely for American audiences (the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase). And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaneys character. A great actor forced to play this part that couldve been written by a five year old. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and its a bad when you have to say that. Well, at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful American accent. International Audiences be warned stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. Youll have a better time. Intermission is a walk-outer#0
6883_4#I being of Puertorican descent, had mixed fillings about this  documentary . First I was offended that Ms. Perez compared Senor Campos to Che Guevarra. Also just a point of fact,Mr. John Leguzaimo is not of Puertorican descent.His parents came from Columbia. Whomever did research on this was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race rests on education. This message should have been resounding throughout this film, Education is our road to freedom and power I think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus.In my opinion,this film swayed toward an anti-American sentiment.#0
3964_7#I found The FBI Story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my New Years Day holiday viewing. Its drama and action-packed episodes were thrilling. The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. Overall the photography, script and direction was perfectly creditable. Rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda, as some might, I enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husbands commitment to his (arguably) important work, I did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one.#1
6649_1#OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was Great or even Good is either delusional or knows the Director, Writer and Producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was Horrible. Im an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears. The reason Im being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on  Of Mice and Men  and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankruptfor someone to take a classic book and film  Of Mice and Men  and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal. I mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified. Did not like this movie at all.#0
9064_4#In fact, Marc Blitzsteins off-Broadway adaptation of  Threepenny  was not so  bowdlerised  as is generally believed. (At one time, MGM also offered a 2-LP set of the  entire  play, doubtless as heavily censored.)#0
441_9#This is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life. The pacing, the camera work, the emotion, the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see. It isnt easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted. The only flaw I can see about this film is that it wasnt captured in a more technically perfect film format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the very finest sound format available.(An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter.) The gorgeous Italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film. I cant stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite. The transformations of the characters from contained, tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often. The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is above reproach. It is a film about middle age and the choices people make.It is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness. Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you. If you dont get it, perhaps you havent lived enough, or something else is wrong with you.#1
8904_4#I personally liked  The Prophecy  of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasnt flawless, it was a creepy and highly original Horror/Fantasy film that entertained immensely. This inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however,  The Prophecy II  sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. The character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, however was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who wouldnt shut up. Still, Walkens performance isnt the only redeeming quality of the film. The entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriels resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the  Prophecy  films.  The Prophecy II  is nevertheless the weakest of the three  Prophecy  films with Walken. Definitely a Christopher Walken one-man-show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.#0
7376_8#I really enjoyed this debut by Ring director, Hideo Nakata. If youve seen Ring beforehand then youll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick. Its got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre. If you like films that give you the chills, then you will probably like this one. A good, creepy debut by Hideo Nakata. 8/10#1
2990_10#I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars but, other than his, I have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions, love, and sacrifice (three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common). This is a film which is much more significant and well-made than youve been led to believe.#1
11466_10#I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. Its an amazing movie. A very disturbing one at that. A+.#1
371_1#The worst movie I have seen in a while. Yeah its fun to fantasize, but if that is what you are looking for, I suggest you see Brewsters Millions. This was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny. Unless you are five or like terrible movies, dont see this one.#0
9555_10#I saw this film 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah Yorks Birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this film on TV since. I took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale, as Lusty the sailor. I believe that Dale now does the narration of the Harry Potter books on Casette, but anyway he is quite funny. This is a fast paced comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through their film collection, and consider restoring and releasing this film to DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as Ramble the sailor. This is a bawdy comedy, the kind of film one no longer sees, with great production values.    1/2 stars out of     #1
7005_4#What if Somerset Maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club? If he had, he could have called it The Razors Edge, since the Katha-Upanishad tells us,  The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard.  But Maugham decided to stick with the well-bred class, and so we have Darryl F. Zanucks version of Larry Darrell, recently returned from WWI, carefully groomed, well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner.  Maugham, lest we forget, was a fine writer of plays, novels, essays and short stories. To see how the movies could do him justice, watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore, Trio and Quartet. And instead of wasting time with Larry Darrell, spend some time with Lawrence Durrell. The Alexandria Quartet is a good read.#0
658_1#I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came on IMDb to check out the comments. A comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog. I never go by other peoples opinions, so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. It had to be one of the WORST movies Ive ever seen. Dont waste your time or money. Go see a GOOD movie.#0
8114_8#If scientists behaved in a way that H.G. Wells was confident they would in the future, history wouldnt quite have turned out the way it did in Things To Come. Were almost 80 years past the point that Wells wrote The Shape Of Things To Come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he describes than before, in some ways farther away. Wells got it wrong both in time and in development. He apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power. Computer programmers are far more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment. Still Things To Come, aided by the direction of William Cameron Menzies and the sets created offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of H.G. Wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time though he didnt quite get right the shape of Things To Come.#1
9269_1#Well since seeing parts 1 through 3 I can honestly say that they should have NEVER made part 4. Everything from the tacky, and I DO mean tacky score to the really bad acting, I dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds. I mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of Damion, but without him around in this one its just not the same. Sure by the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continued story lines, but it was a good closure at the end of the third one. Again there was no reason for a part 4. Even if there was they could have done a MUCH better job than this sh t I had to sit through, lol. There goes an hour and a half of my life ill never see again.#0
3570_10#I thought it was an original story, very nicely told. I think all you people are expecting too much. I meanits just a made for television movie! What are you expecting? Some Great wonderful dramtic piece? I thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie.and thats my opinion.#1
9913_10#In addition to being an extremely fun movie, may I add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. This kind, fun loving woman had a great deal of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money. This woman was lonely since the death of her husband. He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down. To prevent that, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid she was throwing away  their  money and decided to take action. The character actors in this film were a great plus also. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library, but as of yet, its never been released. Sad.#1
785_9#Me being of Irish origins, loved this movie, Not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl who he fell in love with too, she was pretty. They were such a cute couple. The ending was so sad. Love this movie! Although it is a little dirty, it reminds of a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie you should watch prime. Same story line young guy falls for older women, older women falls for young guy to. A lot of paths cross, in the end, the best decision is made or task is completed. Dont have anything else to say, without ruining the whole movie, all though I thought the french guy was ugly, less appealing to me. Ummif you like Irish movies, I would recommend  Circle of Friends  ,that movie is so good. Quick quote, you might not get unless you watch it  well, thats my dinner ruined.  LOL#1
5226_10#What is with all of the European (especially England) comments here? All i gotta say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like 13 i thought it was great. Of course its stupid. Thats the point. You have to see the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come on people, what did you expect to see? I can think of many movies that are far worse than this, and they were expensive Hollwood films with real actors in them. For what its worth, Men in White is a very stupid-funny mock of a movie. And with all the stupid-funny stuff that England has been making for the last half century, i am shocked at all the negative comments. Us stupid Americans like our stupid humor. P.S., see Team America World Police  for some true laughs that Europeans will especially like. HA #1
9488_2#Ive seen some very terrible horror movies in my time, and while this isnt the worst of the bunch, its certainly in the lower half. The script starts off OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern, hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife. Cute huh? The movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. Turns out that theres a demon on the basement thats harvesting peoples souls. Its the job of the 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs, do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out, and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects. At this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid, I was begging for it to be over. There was still an hour to go. It looked like a half an hour  Tales From the Crypt  episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap-fest. From Tiny Lister doing his best John Coffey (The Green Mile) impersonation to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet, this movie fails in every possible level. I gave this 2 stars for only TWO reason. 1) His fiancé is pretty hot, she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2) The movie actually looks OK, a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal-mart quality home cameras. In the end, avoid this turd even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass (which I do, and I still felt cheated). As a bonus drinking game, you and your buddies take a shot every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. Youll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie.#0
5552_1#This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. Its tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style. It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet. After all, so do re-runs of Gilligans Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch. This just doesnt employ professional actors. The intelligence level is about the same.#0
4422_4#This one is a real bomb. We are supposed to believe that Merle Oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle cant go anywhere, but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking, quaking wives and supported only by kindly uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper happens to show up. Some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things, a la  Misfits,  but no such luck with this one. Gary later breaks in to a formal dinner, at which Merle is presiding, and, though invited to sit down and join the group, reads them a lecture on their snobbery. Where did this diffident cowboys sudden eloquence come from? The most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that Gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife, Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.#0
2463_10#William Shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play. Not only is it the best movie version of it, but its also the only complete version of Hamlet. Kenneth Branaghs Hamlet is simply genius. Not only because it was written by Shakespeare, but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing, even if it went just over four hours. All in all, youll never find a more rich and lavish production of the Bards best play. To say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement. If you love this play and are a fan of Shakespeare, you definitely need to check this movie out. Even if you dont really care for Shakespeare, the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film. You may not think youll be able to sit through all of it at once, but youll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more.#1
778_10#Im not much of an expert on acting or other movie details, but this movie just hit me deep. I dont think Ill ever forget it. One scene especially (I think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one I am speaking) is imprinted on my brain. More people need to see this film #1
747_10#Although I was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school (1996) when I saw it I became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them. Now at the age of 27 I recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth (though none of my friends died). I think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up.#1
1032_1#While I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to its horrid production values), it appears like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with it?! Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grates on the nerves--and this is only in the BETTER episodes  After many years, it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess! I can see why in the live-action Scooby-Doo movie they made the villain Scrappy-Doo--since practically everyone hates him!#0
3102_9#I saw the The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow! I had already seen the first two films and I liked them, but Ultimatum, I loved. Of all the  threequels  that came out last summer, this was the best.#1
1455_7#Mardi Gras Made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but, are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another. David Redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in America for up to 20 dollars. When Redmon questions Americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded. When he told them that they are made in China for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, Americans seemed sad, hurt, and a little remorseful but didnt really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth. When Redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that Americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads. The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldnt believe it. This movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own. M. Pitts#1
9181_10#I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries. I had read and watched many classics before, and I believed that most classics were boring, over-worded, and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best. This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions. I read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed Charolette Brontes writing. Jane Eyre is now my favorite film and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, watch the 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre.#1
8566_3#So, this movie has been hailed, glorified, and carried to incredible heights. But in the end what is it really? Many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work. The fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated, and scenes that are in ASL are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent. The voice interpretation of Matlins dialogue, under the excuse that Hurts character  likes the sound of his voice , turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on. Matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view. But nonetheless, most of the movie, when this is a love story, is only showed from a single point of view, that of the man. As Ebert said,  If a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate, its not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them.  And for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be, Marlee Matlin remains Hollywoods token deaf woman to this day.#0
8305_3#Like most people I love  A Christmas Story . I had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason--it is awful. Same locale, same narrator, same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking. Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin but I cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him. The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In  A Christmas Story  Ralphies obsession with the BB gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the original neighborhood bully, is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the Scud Farkus menacing appeal. It would be pretty difficult to equal the original, even if this movie had been made with the original crew.#0
8272_3#At the end of  Dragon Heat,  all I could think of was why I bothered sitting through the whole thing.  Dragon Heat,  on the other hand, is just terribly mediocre. The trouble is that Lee has not made a bad action film, he has made a dull one.#0
6599_1#Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a renowned actor. Practically any movie that hes been in is the better off for it. Now ol George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie, but he once said something that describes said movie to a T. I say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal (just so long as you steer clear of  Atoll K  and  Be Big ).#0
4896_7# I hate those stories that begin with a funeral, but Im afraid this one begins the day we buried George. Not that we buried him. In the interests of the environment we had him incinerated.  So speaks Elizabeth (Judi Dench), Georges widow. Shes led a comfortable, predictable life with George. She has two grown children and a 12-year-old grandchild. But when she was 15 and in school, in the midst of World War II, she played the sax at night in an all-girl (almost all-girl) band called The Blonde Bombshells. The almost  was because the drummer was Patrick, a charming rogue who had no desire to fight and possibly be killed. With a yellow wig, a long red dress and makeup, Patrick looked almost as good as the others.  This is sentimental hogwash, expertly done, and not bad at all. What makes it work are the skill and charm of Judi Dench and Ian Holm. When I hear the term,  warm-hearted comedy,  I usually cringe unless the actors are first-rate. Dench and Holm are wonders to watch as they take something as light-weight and predictable as this script and turn it into something that charms us. Then theres the  old broad  gambit thats fun if you remember the old broads. Among the Blonde Bombshells are Leslie Caron, Joan Sims, Olympia Dukakis, Billie Whitelaw and Cleo Laine. Laine sings three numbers and almost over-balances the production. She is so strong and unique a jazz talent that while shes singing the program nearly becomes the Cleo Laine Show. Another attractive feature is the number of great WWII songs played in strong swing.#1
4846_7#This is a classic British comedy-thriller I had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now. Its based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously (most notably in 1931 by the same director but, unfortunately, this version seems not to have survived in its entirety!); for the remake under review, the plot has been updated to the then-current wartime situation. The remote single setting (the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night) provides for some wonderful atmosphere; the last half-hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is especially gripping and well handled. Also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is Kathleen Harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster, with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink.#1
2136_1#Quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen. When has Hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked Republicans? Why dont they learn. The Dixie chicks havent. These Lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves; oblivious to the fact that most of America is much further right than they are. It wasnt funny.#0
2571_7#Arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life far too seriously  Watch this film for what it is, sit back, relax and have a giggle. The film does not take itself seriously, so neither should we. If you like James Belushi, you will like this film. If he is not your cup of tea - give it a miss. I like James Belushi, so I liked this film. So simple isnt it?? -)#1
11667_9#The Secret of Kells is a film Ive been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. Im here to tell you now its been worth the wait. The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as Id feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page. The characterisation is superb, I love Brendan Gleesons voice as the stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of the sprite Aisling. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well realised, a mix of fact and fantasy. and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. Im a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know whove seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that its a lovely little film. I will definitely buy the DVD when its released, and would like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. May there be many more. ) Coming back in here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nominated.#1
9035_4#Being born in the 1960s I grew up watching the TV  Movies of the Week  in the early 70s and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including  Crowhaven Farm ,  Bad Ronald ,  Satans School for Girls ,  Kolchak the Night Stalker , etc, but this one is just plain dumb.This is obviously the writers trying to capitalize on the horrific Manson murders from a few years earlier. The movie stars Dennis Weaver of  McCloud  and  Duel  fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weavers pacifistic stance is hard to swallow. For Gods sake, call the police, beat the hell of them or something, just dont sit there and whine about it. The acting is pretty lame, the story unbelievable, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini but thats about it. Ignore this if it ever airs on TV.#0
3847_9#In its time, this movie had controversy written all over it (like most of Verhoevens projects). Ive done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie, and as you can see, its not easily summed up in words. So do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie somewhere, watch it ! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.#1
7417_2#This film is so bad - dialogues, story, actors and actresses - everything! - that its hard to imagine that well see a worse movie this year or in the following years.  Loves Brother  (set in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow clichés about Italian culture to offer, and it is quite telling that even the Italians from and in Italy speak ENGLISH in the film. The message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly discomforting. Giovanni Ribisi is quite good in films like Suburbia or Lost in Translation, but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. See this film at your own risk. Trash as trash can #0
1740_8#This movie was not so much promoted here in Greece,even though it got good actors , great script and rather good photograph was not a so called  blockbuster  movie in my Country. The movie itself is very powerful,its about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home-village after been released from a 5yo prison time(drugs) The end is rather sad. Mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency 7 out of 10 because very few Greek movies can make such an impression #1
8299_7#When the scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts the invitation to work the Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) to a huge modern house in the corporation compound. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matt telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted with the offer. Later he is introduced to the director of the club, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci) that befriends Patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. Matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about Jessica and the members. Title (Brazil)  Convite Para o Inferno  ( Invitation to Hell )#1
3381_10#This is a great movie but there could be more about Soylent Green. There should be more scenes of what they do to people. How people act in 2022. I think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year 2022 and beyond. Even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie. So go rent or buy this movie right NOW #1
4239_10#My observations Postwar hilarity. Tom Drake and Grandpa from  Meet Me in St. Louis  two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed charming and pretty. Margaret Hamilton good as always; smaller part than in  Wizard of Oz . Spring Byington way prettier, also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by Hamilton. Tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious. As a two year veteran of Army tents, he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. 10/10#1
8026_2#It makes one wonder how this show is still on the air. Theres been one couple that has stayed together, married, and has children, but everyone else has broken up. Whats the point of continuing this? The show can be entertaining at the beginning. You see all the girls swooning over one man, that almost all of them like instantly. Its just like in real life! The girls start to take sides, bitch one another out, and show their true selves (or so we think). But that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after. What is true love exactly? How can you fall for someone when youre forced to pick them? This show is unbelievable. You thought dating online was bad, but people have to go on TV to find love? Its not realistic. How could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others, making out with them? None of these questions are answered, and finally when the show ends, you know there wont be a happy ending in the future. For all we know, everything is scripted.#0
1326_10#I saw this movie at a college film festival back in the 70s - I have been waiting FOREVER for this movie to come out on video (finally its out). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed that was why it hadnt made it to video yet. I have been checking video stores for the past 15 years waiting for this outstanding movie to come out! It is one of my all-time favorites - but be warned, it is weird, like Werner Herzog weird - its weirdness stems from its super-realism. #1
399_2#This picture started out with good intentions, Bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is cute as usual in her role. It all falls apart after that, its your typical Hollywood thriller now, filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore, minus any kind of humour, wit or soul. In other words, dont waste your time watching this. Get the audiocassette tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man instead, also starring Leonard Nimoy. Now that was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike with this mess.#0
6119_1#Muscular man-ape in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team; the comely daughter of the teams leader finds him first. Much-ballyhooed version of the Tarzan tale has an OK production, but is crippled by the single-handedly worst direction of a film I have ever seen. John Derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow-motion action shots and peek-a-boo glimpses of wife Bo Dereks unclothed body; he has about as much talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. Trying for tongue-in-cheek sexuality, the Dereks lack finesse, snappy timing, and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and bravura abandonment (they do throw caution to the winds), but after a promising opening it all goes to hell. Miles OKeeffe (who possibly had marbles in his mouth the entire time) has the title role, but plays third fiddle to John Dereks ego and Bo Dereks sense of self-importance.   from     #0
7557_9#Gender Bender the Limerick Gender Bender is another great Season 1 episode. I enjoy this one because the story is the kind where you are never really sure whats gonna happen next. It is entirely original. The teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. I really need to learn my that thumb trick the genderbender heshe does. I really like the atmosphere at the Kindreds little village and Mulder and Scully sneaking around in the middle of the night. Its very exciting. This is one of my favorite Season 1 episodes in fact. I think the thing I like about it so much is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and left crop circles. Many people see this as a non-mythology related alien episode kind of like  The Unnatural  or  Space  but I think this could easily be seen as mythology related. Maybe the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter and could appear to look like anyone. Huh? Anyway I give the episode a 9 out of 10.#1
4525_8#Buster Keaton was finding his feature length voice in  Three Ages.  There are some fine sequences, but it doesnt quite hang together. The  chariot race  in  Three Ages  is hilarious. Included are 2 shorts, one of which,  The Goat,  is excellent.#1
6106_9#When it comes to the erotic genre, Im lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love You Dont Touch Me) directed two very strong lead actors Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this enthralling thriller. Kira is convincing as  Kim  a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of Doug Jefferys  The Man  a handsome stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role, and as actress, giving what could have been simply another T and A depth and believability. I believe it to be her best performance yet. And Julie Davis direction is a great gift to erotica.#1
11279_1#Words really cant describe how bad this film is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off. This is just laughable! Terrible script, poor direction, awful acting and you know what? I cant think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isnt too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money (assuming that you need it!). Incidentally, I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. IT IS TERRIBLE!#0

11371_10#This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. From the very start I was utterly hooked into the (true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the childrens bodies. This then is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly believable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a superb character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape, to the superlative performances by everyone involved.  I rate this film 10/10#1
10805_2#The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. Ive always heard how awful it was. The movie did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaqs outfits. The worst parts were, well, just about everything else. My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and couldnt look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max didnt wish for Kazzam to fix that front tooth of his! But for all its terribleness we just couldnt stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic. But it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched  Kazzam .#0
8297_1#Ugh! Where to begin  first, Campbell Scotts non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile (a very short while) as he internalizes his mounting anguish, curiosity and anger. Only we dont care! These characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable, and therein lies the key. They havent given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another. When Scott quietly tells his wife,  I could kill you  before their three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off I almost wished that he had--and then done the same thing to the smug, wisecracking apparition of Denis Leary before being hauled off the the looney bin. An utter waste of time and perhaps--only perhaps--resources.#0

Danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of . crosses the border Im afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie.

9266_9#Ah, the best and funniest movie about female football fans, only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage delusion set in North London (qv).

2277_4#The Vampire Bat is definitely of interest, being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930s, but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise. All we are left with is a poor-quality Frankenstein imitation, with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans. But for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer was doing the Blondie films a few years later.#0
1754_3#Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original show and characters? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting. Why cant there ever be daughters who like their mothers on TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why couldnt Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping grounds again.#0
10638_8#When I think about this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, thats how I think this movie should be judged in terms of. See the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace, or the sweltering turkish bath, and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice, coarse cloth, smooth skin, scented oils, flickering flames, satin rustle. Dont just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you.#1

If you want to see something funny go watch  No On Would Tell  Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate those kids, and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest. Ive seen funner stuff everywhere else but here. I AHet writing 10 lines!

6622_1#I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie was not it. Thank god they didnt let them use the name  Sholay  in the movie title. Ram Gopals remake is not worthy of the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abisheks role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, dont bother with this movie or the DVD when that comes out.#0
6019_1#This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of 0/10. The acting is awful, even what some here have lauded, the Carpathia character! The script looks like it was written in haste. In one scene, the black preacher who was left behind, when asked by Buck what  dan7  in the computer graphic meant, said,  Daniel 7,  CHAPTER  24.  He probably meant VERSE 24, but the film makers missed this slip up. Perhaps the worst part is that the films eschatological position is Biblically unsound. While many Christians have espoused the films interpretation of end-time events, such interpretation, in  my opinion , is faulty. To understand these flaws, read  Christians Will Go Through The Tribulation  by Jim McKeever and  The Blessed Hope, A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture  by George E. Ladd.#0
2900_9#Should this be an American movie Id rate it 7 weve seen this before.

265_7#A series of random, seemingly insignificant thefts at her sisters boarding house has Miss Lemon quite agitated. A ring, light bulbs, a rucksack, a lighter, a stethoscope, a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it. Miss Lemon asks her employer, the great Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, to look into the matter. But what Poirot sees is something far more sinister than Miss Lemon could have imagined. And Poirots fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered. Its up to Poirot to bring a killer to justice. I realized while re-watching Hickory Dickory Dock just what a tremendous influence Agatha Christies work was on the highly stylized Italian mystery films, or Gialli, of the 60s and 70s. Take the murder of Mrs. Nicoletis as an example. If you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene, you would have something straight out of an early 70s Giallo. In fact, the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock could have been used in a Giallo. Its just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked.#1
10542_7#Tweaked a little bit, Nothing could be a childrens film. Its a very clever concept, touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes, and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think ofwhat goes against everything more than, literally,  nothing ? Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives. All thats left is what they dont hate, and a big empty white space. Its hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film, especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot. It focuses on pretty much one subject, but thats prime Vincenzo Natali territory. If youve seen Cube, you know already that he tends to like that type of situation. The  nothing  in this movie is apparently infinite space, but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic, if only because theres literally nothing else, and nowhere else to go. The actors sell it, although you can tell these guys are friends anyway. Two actors from Cube return here (Worth and Kazan), but are entirely different characters. They change throughout the story, and while theyre not the strongest actors in the world, theyre at least believable. At any rate, this is a reasonably entertaining film, albeit with a few dragged-out scenes. But for literally being about nothing, and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing, they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film.#1
8937_9#This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects. Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African American women over a turbulent century. Good movie with a good message.#1
4093_4#The plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify AS  plot  and  character . The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out-of-focus, and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesnt help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are pretty entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. Though he does show his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b     d whos just minding his own business!Images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from Fulci. Maybe it ruined his career, but it wasnt really much more stupid than Zombie. Worth a rental if you like gory Italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?#0
6862_10#When people ask me why do I like movies so much, I usually respond,  have you seen the art-gallery sequence in De Palmas Dressed to Kill?  That scene alone, pretty much represents everything I want to see in a film. If I was a film director, that would be the kind of thing Id like to do.  Pure cinema  is one way of describing that sequence, and it is truly amazing to see how director De Palmas entire movie works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene. It is a dream-like movie, clever as hell, and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together. I think the movie raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion could a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success? The film has no message to speak of, acting is great but it is at the service of the style, and the script is short on logic. De Palmas movie makes a really good case that style, when handled properly, can sustain a feature length film. Sure, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superlative performances, but this is a directors movie all the way to the fadeout. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. I wont tell you what Hitchcock movie the film pays homage to (I dont want to spoil any surprises), but I think De Palma transcends the storys arc, and he manages to create a film that pretty much summarizes his entire career. Not for the faint of heart #1
9856_4#In the autobiographical coming-of-age tale  Romulus, My Father,  Eric Bana, of  Munich  fame, plays an impoverished German émigré struggling to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in rural 1960s Australia. The major obstacle to the familys stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men. Despite her highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him. It is, unfortunately, the good-hearted and good-natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie (Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author). Even though I admire  Romulus, My Father  for what it is trying to do, I cant honestly say I enjoyed it, for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it, these simply arent enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing, which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen. A serious slice-of-life drama is one thing, but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery, insanity and multiple suicides (let alone attempted suicides) is something else again.#0
8808_9#First of all Ive got to give it to the people that got this thing together. 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts. Its a shame, although not surprising, that the movie was banned in the US. If you happen to have the chance to see it then you should, that is, unless youre a conservative in which case youd better stay out as you might get offended. But if youre not then you might learn how many of us outside the US lived through 9/11.#1
9070_7#It started out slow after an excellent animated intro, as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop. Once the bet is on, though, the movie picks up the pace as its a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son bullies, helping others, mind over matter when you dont want to do something. One other good aspect of the movie was the respect/fear engendered by the principal Mr. Burdock (Boilerplate). Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons. While he has one particular goofy scene, he ruled the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin getting some work.#1

8485_8#Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time. The result is uneven, but generally entertaining. Keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well. Wantabedde is even better. One warning George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise, this is quite enjoyable time capsule.#1
5139_4#A lot of horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I wont be very popular in saying that I found it to be rather boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. I think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness. Sometimes horror films set in darkness can work (such as Humongous), but Scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film. A lot of the time its hard to figure out whats actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see. If a little more lighting had been used, perhaps it couldve been better. Theres not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge, apart from Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend that over Scarecrows any day.#0
9748_10#I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 years old and into classic rock (still am)  I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, watch and enjoy.  smile  Maybe I should head over to Amazon.com and have a look before its sold out.#1
7642_9#Not really a big box office draw, but I was pleasently surprised highly recommend you check#1
8691_1#If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still couldnt make it through from beginning to end. I cant believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise! The acting is atrocious all around, the script is blah, the kid playing Nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened. The  southern  accent from the actress playing Ambers mom is laughable - Im from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me NOBODY talks like that! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment.#0
3490_8#This movie was pretty good. The acting was great, and there were some really great actors in it like, Buchholz and Roger Moore. This film is full of surprises. Confusing at timesyes, but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense. The only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars.#1
2013_3#This film is roughly what it sounds like a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend but with songs and (fairly tame) sex scenes! The film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess. Its more expensive looking than most of director Al Adamsons films but its not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci-fi films. The actors are pretty bad and unlike most Adamson films, there are no former big namers or B actors. Some of the music is OK but its easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.#0
10220_7#That hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (Its funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally , too.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they bad, too! One is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where eer she goes. The other is got up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual, slightly parted lips. And, not to give anything away, she is even more bad than the other. Its lots of fun -- and on its own terms, too.#1
11386_4#One of those Thank-God-I-dont-live-there documentaries. This one tells of two warring factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries, and the surrounding peoples of Medellin. Based on this documentary, all, Im afraid.#0
10765_1#A splendid example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up. In my opinion,  The Big Sky  further solidifies Howard Hawks place as one of the most overrated, tepid directors in the history of cinema.#0
5099_1#This incredibly overrated anime television series (26 episodes, 25 minutes each) is about a 14-year-old boy (and two of his girl classmates) who pilots a giant robot to defend Japan against invading beings called Angels. There is very little explanation given to the Angels or why their numbers have increased in recent times, and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason (why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans youre attempting to destroy?). The robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles, but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch. Almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occurs.  Evangelion  represents everything anime should NOT be - massive quantities of dull, pretentious tripe under the guise of intelligent cinema. The universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable; and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as  one of mankinds greatest achievements  is probably the most stupifying comment Ive ever heard on IMDb - and Ive seen some doozies.#0
3160_1#You know you are in trouble watching a comedy, when the only amusing parts in it are from the Animal cast. It is a pity then that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support & not the other way around, as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughout. The worst film I have seen in years, & hopefully never see one as bad again, though I expect not.#0
120_8#It is not every films job to stimulate you superficially. I will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day. While this really cant be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. That indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again. This is a challenging, provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly. The problem with the movie is in its structure. Its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up, just as a second ending is tacked on. Though everything is technically dazzling, the movie is exactly too long by that unit. The long-delayed climax of Leos awakening comes about 20 minutes late. It is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review. You should see it at least once. You get the sense that von Trier bit off more than he could chew, but this movie ends up being richer for it. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcocks Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. All von Trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies. After Zentropa, von Trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary, over-rated, un-nuanced sap like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.#1
12152_9#I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was really gooda tragic love story indeed! I really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident. Its rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped. The love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how Id like to think love can heal someones heart. Laura Leightonall of 27 when she made this moviewas great as the woman so full of life shes able to revive this guys heart. Unfortunately, since his family is wealthy and hers is not,  problems  develop. Its playing on HBO some more times this month.

9513_10#A great gangster film.Sam Mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son camaraderie.Brilliant star-cast leading with Tom Hanks(Michael Sullivan) has done a terrific job.Great acting by him again.He is an acting legend.Great acting too from Paul Newman,Jude Law and Daniel Craig.Casting is just too good.The plot is quite good.You will enjoy the movie.A great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930s.Set in the 1930s,this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era.Soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie.A great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son.Way underrated for my liking.Deserved a fully deserved 10.#1
10747_10#Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie New York City firefighters. What they got was the only film footage inside the World Trade Center on September 11. Unlike a feature film of similar title, most of the money from DVD sales go to 9/11-related charities. Very well made, emotional, moving, and completely devoid of political propaganda, is the best documentary of the sort to date.#1
10322_2#If youre looking to be either offended or amused or both, youll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really isnt even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived mess. Unless youre obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really dont see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.#0
2281_4#Think  stage play . This is worth seeing once for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. COmpare the Melvyn DOuglas in  Ghost Story  with the Melvyn DOuglas of this film. Are there vampires at loose in this Bavarian village, or is there a more natural, albeit equally sinister, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who is cast as an especially moronic character. Its fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character. NOt much happens for a long time, but then we discover that Atwills pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer. There is too much comic relief but that is par for the course for this era. Fay Wray looks really good.#0
861_2#A disappointing film. Technically, a disgusting shot film.#0
11668_7#By 1945, and after a string of solid WWII propaganda pieces, Errol Flynn’s hold over U.S. box office had started to decline so, in spite of the increased burden of waning looks, he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler. The first of these was a good one actually – ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) – but it also proved to be his last big-budget Hollywood starring vehicle. The rest of his sword-wielding days were spent wandering all over Europe in England for KIM (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) and THE DARK AVENGER (1955), in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) and Italy for the aborted THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL (1953) and the little-seen CROSSED SWORDS (1954). However, Hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways – albeit for a modestly-budgeted Universal picture rather than a Warner Brothers ‘A’ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak…  For what it’s worth, the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on DVD and, as a matter of fact, AGAINST ALL FLAGS itself was the one gem in a poorly-thought out “Pirates Of The Golden Age Movie Collection” set from Universal which also consisted of obscure dross like BUCCANEER’S GIRL (1950; with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951; with Donald O’Connor) and YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952; with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, perhaps but, so far, I have only acquired the Errol Flynn flick from other sources; even so, if the mood strikes me in future, I might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like Edward Dmytyk’s MUTINY (1952), the afore-mentioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961).#1
495_1#This was an incredibly stupid movie. It was possibly the worst movie Ive ever had the displeasure of sitting through. I cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6.#0
2177_2#The first noticeable problem about this awkwardly titled film is its casting. Ann Nelson plays the grandma here. Three years after this, she would star in  Airplane!  as the woman who hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get that image out of my head. This is unrated, and contains some physical violence and mild profanity.#0
6823_1#I should have trusted my instincts better No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, youll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was Philip Glasss soundtrack. I couldnt - and still cant - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a big waste of time! My advice Forget commercialism! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again instead!#0
481_3#Any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesnt bother with an actual story, its annoying. Those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first, and the story simply tacked on. For this reason we often talk of the story  jumping through hoops  as it twists about, trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion. The central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession. Since its all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion. So, in the end theres no point to the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor screenplays, the acting doesnt save a thing.#0
11367_2#Greg Davis and Bryan Daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists, add some commentary by a bunch of uber-right reactionaries, ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a Moslem, and presents this as the theology of Islam. Maybe their next film will involve interviewing Fred Phelps and the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church, adding commentary by some militant atheist  scholars, and call their film  What the World Needs to Know About Christianity.  Ultimately, this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism. Dont waste your time and money; just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a couple of days for free and youll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.#0
7231_1#I saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing  Last Days  and some Charlie Chaplin films. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give  Immortel  a chance. I nearly walked out of this movie, and I LIKE science-fiction! The story is set in a futuristic New York city, filled with Blade Runner-style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning/synthetic humans. Unfortunately, the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour-and-forty-five-minute movie. Three groups exist in this world humans, artificial humans, and Egyptian gods. The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city. The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and complete with a deteriorated exterior, leaving a smooth  cap  on the pyramid. Wouldnt a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why its there. I wont bore you with the so-called plot, but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross-out scenes. The film, as I said, looks to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film credits were listed thank-yous to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who dont speak French. Hence, it is obvious that their French dialog has been dubbed. This is a distraction, and I also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting. It doesnt help that the animations are poor--no better than a video game. Skip this one.#0
3487_9#Wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great Wrestlemanias but I would personally put it, in my top 5, if not the top 3. It has so many great things, and it truly signified the birth of The Attitude Era, which was WWEs best era, in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and him putting over Austin like he did, on his way out, was pure class on his part. It has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see, and it has J.R and The King at their announcing best!.  9 1/2 /10#1
3746_1#As hard as it is for me to believe, with all of the awful reality shows out there over the past few years, this one has to take over the top spot for worst one yet. I am still wondering if this was actually just a spoof done by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann were still alive Id be sure he was behind this. Can a rock band stoop any lower than has INXS to do such a shameful thing as this? The premise is simple and moronic. Audition a bunch of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of INXS, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime. So they trot all of these awful singers (I thought American Idol had its share of doozies) who do atrocious renditions of just about every classic (and predictable) rock song imaginable. And then they cut to the INXS band members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see better (and more original) rock performers at just about any night club in any city in the world. It has all the usual uncreative elements of every other reality show. Lame reality participants, lame interviews, lame host/emcee, lame  judging  of performances, and the lame booting of one participant at the end of each show. Can these shows get any more predictable? Its clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band; a last gasp of hope at rekindling their lost stardom before they are finally buried into oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any shred of dignity when alive, has to be rolling over in his grave. Not that INXS were ever a great band, but I had no idea they were this pathetic. If INXS are at all representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all, dead.#0
8718_4#The third installment of the  Carnosaur  trilogy features a bunch of Keystone Kops-quality military commandos trying to kill two Velociraptors and a T-Rex. I give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. The movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really cant be taken seriously. More significantly, however, watching this movie I cant help but notice some interesting parallels between the  Carnosaur  and  Xtro  trilogies. The first installment in both franchises is a dark, disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an  Alien  ripoff, and the third is a tongue-in-cheek, almost slapstick (whether intentional or not) movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing. Also, like the  Xtro  franchise, all the  Carnosaur  movies are completely unrelated to one another. They they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the  sequels,  I guess. Obviously  Carnosaur  and  Xtro  have two different production groups at work here, but if youve seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two.#0
5386_7#This film is one that played very well back in 1932 and probably wouldnt work as well today because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived. However, if you are the sort person, like me, who adores older Hollywood films, you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is--an interesting soap. There are most stories than this but the ones I mentioned are the main ones. As I said, its a soap opera of sorts and is highly entertaining--and quite sad in the case of several of the stories. The ending, in particular, is heart-breaking and exceptionally well done. There were a few particularly good performances--especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as the head nurse. All in all, a very good film--and I have no idea why they felt they had to remake the film just a few years later (which was typical for Warner Brothers).#1
8578_8#This film is one of the finest American B-movies of the 90s. If youre looking for a serious film, look elsewhere. However, if youre looking for some action, a lot of laughs, and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters, this is well worth watching. Everyone chews the scenery a bit, but thats really what the film is all about, and everyone is quite funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together.#1
11021_8#After the success of Die Hard and its sequels its no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of Die Hard on a .. movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. That is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly Stop or My Mom Will Shoot Stallones career. So forget your better judgement, who cares if that could never happen, lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! And if youre looking for Qaulen, hes the one wearing the helicopter.#1

9210_10#I feel this is one of the best movies Ive seen,Im an older male and love most westerns. I love movies based in part at least on facts,If I am not mistaken this is such a movie. I also like revenge type movies,This qualifies there as well in my opinion.Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene. I felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how I feel about the complete movie. I saw what I think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode. I also enjoyed that.I recommend taking the time to watch this movie ,I will watch it again. I also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played. I thought it was so out of character for Randy Travis to play a villain type ,but I always enjoy his acting.#1
1133_4#I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one. A lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre. Usually this is okay because were dealing with a genre, but the challenge generally resides in making it original, new and inventive. This movie fails to do so. Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But its a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteurs.#0
9363_2#This movie has some fatal flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr.s office, is just bad writing or bad editing.  Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie no actor would want on their resume.#0
7563_1#Unfortunately, this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as actors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non-plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better. Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whiskey and enjoy.#0
2677_9#This film takes you on one familys impossible journey, and makes you feel every step of their odyssey. Beautifully acted and photographed, heartbreakingly real. Its last line, with its wistful hope, is one of the more powerful in memory.#1
5557_9# A Mouse in the House  is a very classic cartoon by Tom & Jerry, faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own. It is hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and quite amusing. Artwork is of good quality either. If you ask me, there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon. The funniest for me are, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically «Im glad youre enjoying the siesta» and that she hopes theyre satisfied because she aint, making the two cats gasp. Another funny gag is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan and then Butch does the same trick to Tom. Of course that, even funnier than this, is when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears and both (dumb!) cats think they are seeing each other disguised as Mammy and then they both attack her on the  rear  - lol. Naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad, she isnt someone to mess with. But even Jerry doesnt win this time, because he is expelled by her too.#1
8671_3#I watched this movie on march 21 this year.Must say disappointment.But much better than  Tridev .Plot is hackneyed.Tells about Prabhat who lives with his father,Wife and his little brother.The movie opens when he saves a bride.Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother.He makes a plan by sending few man.They come to a school pretended to be Prabhats friends.Kill that kid.His father throws him out of the house.Then later comes back.He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him.Sunny gives a good performance,Chunky was annoying at best,Naseerdun is wasted.Divya did good,Sonam was wasted,Jyotsna was wasted but looked cute.The kid which played Sunnys brother in the movie was cute.Too sad he had to get his character killed.The girl was cute but was annoying.The other kid did good.Alok did good.Kiran was adequate.Amrish and Gulshan did good.The cinematography is excellent in both India and Kenya.Script is weak but has a few good dialogs.Also drags .The movie.The music was alright.I only liked one song Saat Samundar  the lyrics of that song was good.The other songs were forgettable.Dont watch this. Rating-3/10#0
6407_1#I watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. Thats a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously though, this film is living proof that formula works. If it aint broke, it dont need fixin. A streetwise-yet-vulnerable heroine, a hardened ex-cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with issues. Pure magic.#0
3779_4#Even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6. This dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you may end up answering questions.#0
2847_2#This is simply the worst movie Ive ever seen. Neither of the three central characters has any charm, and Erikas good looks arent enough to carry the film. The lamest plot Ive ever had inflicted upon me. Also the most unconvincing military comedy ever. Why did they bother?#0
7892_1#It started out with an interesting premise. I always like Civil War stuff and ancient secret societies. The more the film progressed, the more I realized that this was a B movie at best. In the latter half, it quickly became a C movie, then D, then F, then  I wish that this wasnt a rental so that I could put it in the microwave!  I cant say that the acting in all cases was awful, just most. The writing, however I never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The screenplay was written by a 10 year old. It was ridiculously shallow, the dialog drab and uninteresting, the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer. I really hated this movie, as did my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity. This movie did a great disservice to the cause. Awful, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I strongly recommend Superman 4.#0
7564_10#In my line of work, I occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film. When I can, I take a look at these low-budget films and often they make me think that the future of Hollywood is going to the dogs. Once in a while, though, there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire, as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible. The short film B R O K E N, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a genuine surprise and worth a second look. MY RATING 8 out of 10.#1
3759_1#Oh where to begin. The cinematography was great. When the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes I thought that I was in for a good movie. Then the cgi Bigfoot showed up .It looked like a cartoon drawing of the Lion king and king Kongs love child.It totally took away from the believability of the character.Now I knew there wasnt a Bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoon.So from then on the whole movie was shot for me.The money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger Patterson did. His was the best Bigfoot costume ever no one else could match his.I am a hardcore cheesy Bigfoot movie fan and I was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and I was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about. I know after you read this review you will still say  I must watch Sasquatch hunters,must watch Sasquatch hunters.  Then you will say why did I waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie #0
6426_4#I found the documentary entitled Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control to be a fairly interesting documentary. The documentary contained four  mini  documentaries about four interesting men. Each one of these men was extremely involved with his job, showing sheer love and enjoyment for ones job. The video was filmed in a very creative way though. I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music.#0
1146_4#This movie certainly proves, that also the good Americans can do terribly good propaganda. No questions being asked, no comments being made on power abuse or police terror, when James Stewart, solid and convincing as always, solves all the stories from Dillinger to 5th Column more or less singlehandedly. June Allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family values and E.J. Hoover is executive producer.And children or non guilty bystanders are never harmed, when the professionals execute. Not to speak of civil rights, which are never broken or homes, which are never intruded. And if the FBI service would not be enough, Steward also gives his sons life for the country in WW II. Perfectly made, if you wouldnt know better.#0
10279_3#This movie was so terrible it was almost good almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who cant sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too.  Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! We think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).#0
1480_8#I am right now in front of the tv, watching Casomai. It is changing, it id evolving or betterdevolving. It begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love-story is reported. After that everything change, a child was born, and all the rest usually happen in a couple. It is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. It doesnt want to show us something particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love-story, the story of a couple, and being normal it become different from the rest. It is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about that, and their opinion is central, the opinions create the story and destroy it. It is a simple story of a couple as I said, but it is not boring, it just show a couple, should be everything known, it is, but I am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen, so dont forget to watch the end!#1
2470_10#After the initial shock of realizing the guts of Mr Branagh to film this, I was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me. I was not disappointed. So true to Shakespeare and yet so accessible. It blew my mind. I always enjoy seeing, or rather listening to, Branagh and it made me wonderis this movie dubbed in other countries? That would be like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa.#1
8225_8#Strange enough, all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over. I feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work, since Marina Vlady was also Robert Hosseins wife, and the - excellent - jazz music was written by te directors father, André. Under these circumstances, no wonder it was a really good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with the music. The suspense was flawless, and maintained throughout until the end. Robert Hossein, at the time one of the best European players, managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director. Hes still putting up great stage shows, with a preference for religious subjects.harry carasso, Paris, France#1
3453_3#It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source. Pretentious.#0
8982_8#Damn, was that a lot to take in. I was pretty much mesmerised throughout. It was pretty perfect, though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that. I cant believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them (Anton especially) to get all of this footage without any serious beef. The Dandys did come off well-together, middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, which maybe wasnt what a lot of other people felt. Great piece of film-making and great choice of subject(s). I recommend this to any music/film fan. Youll probably learn something about film-making.#1
7473_9#Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowes screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabars original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but theres no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. Thats what i mean by more  fleshed out.  #1
1149_3#THE FBI STORY (1959) was Warner Bros. 149 minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency! From a book by Don Whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by Richard L. Green and John Twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by Mervyn LeRoy. However it did have splendid colour Cinematography by Joseph Biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician Max Steiner! Classic but implausible line from THE FBI STORY. As the bland Nick Adams (who has just blown up a plane with 43 people on board, including his mother) is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts  In case I get any mail you can send it to Canyon City prison for the next month or so - after that you can send it to HELL . Wow #0
6146_7#Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins but this is a very different story and while Angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great Julie Andrews. Having said that Lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance. There is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer. It does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice. There are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like Roddy McDowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again. Its also lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the king of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score has a couple of beautiful songs especially The briny sea and The age of Not Believing. The big number Portabello Road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality. The effects look a bit cliché today but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive. The kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the marching song of the home army. The home guard were very important to Britain and this is a warm tribute. The animation is delightful, much better than Pixar which I find grotesque. A warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage.#1
1018_8#The Movie was sub-par, but this Television Pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a Sci-Fi fans Ideal program. The Actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having an intelligent interesting script doesnt hurt either. Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.#1

1078_4#Divorced lawyer Rick Magruder (Branagh) stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named Mallory Doss (Davidtz), who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car. Rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there, seemingly by her father, Dixon Doss (Duvall). Rick and Mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when Mallory carelessly undresses in front of Rick, and he then spends the night with her. Rick wakes up in the morning and Mallory encounters him later in the day, asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior. Rick, now obsessed with Mallory and willing to do anything for her, is successful in having Dixon put on trial and sent to prison, but when he is freed by his local friends, Rick finds himself in a trouble, trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life.#0
12042_10#..as I was when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us; the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book. If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM #1
4854_7#Curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused, irritated and frightened. The creaky old plot about about a phantom train thats said to run through the lonely English countryside at dead of night may be implausible, but its a lot of fun. There are some wonderful old cliches like  THE ACCIDENT  which the locals can remember but wont talk about. But primarily the movies a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits. Askeys corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askeys movies.#1
9841_4#I really, really wanted to like Julian Po. I think that Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So, I do not know if what I see as the films faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesnt answer, because its none of their business. But Julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for Gods sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julians life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his fathers job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julians purpose. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This might work as an allegory, if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. Sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked, contrived film. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who once had so much promise, is given nothing to work with here.#0
6585_3#In reviewing this film I can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August, and September of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training. I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, its talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufmans vivid imagination.#0
5633_8#Farrah Fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would-be rapist. Well done to Farrah for being a Golden Globe Best Actress nominee. Overall, Extremities is a brilliantly thought-out and well-acted movie and I must have watched it hundreds of time by now! Well done to everybody involved.#1
11121_10#As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. I mean, after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster, u thought to yourself OK he is a good actor and he can get into a gangsters skin. But after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life, I mean I could almost feel the pain he  made  us believe he was going through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought at Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more. But nowadays they are either old or dead (Brando) and its OK that they make less movies and their performances are  lighter  than they used to be. I cant wait to see Gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role. Can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance?#1
5774_8#A meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around Crater Lake . As the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster. I like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way. If you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films (Boggy Creek etc.)#1
10118_7#I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really fu  ed my head. Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing. The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well. I havent seen the UK or Japan version, but I have to say that I believe that the German DVD is a bit censored. If you havent seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Nederlands or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes, but at the showdown I felt that something was missing, about one or two very short scenes. All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, thats what I like Miike for #1
4246_4#Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to locate reclusive one-time movie star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estelle checks out for good. Mightve been entitled  Bancroft Talks  as the actress assaults this uncertain comedic/dramatic/sentimental material for its duration. Hot-or-cold director Sidney Lumet cant get a consistent rhythm going, and Bancrofts constant overacting isnt scaled back at all by the filmmaker--he keeps her right upfront cute, teary-eyed and ranting. Estelle becomes a drag on this scenario (not that the thinly-conceived plot has much going on besides). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star, and everyone is trampled by her hamming.  1/2 from     #0
4646_1#Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal, you saw in-jokes all over the place. If you know anything about porn, this mock documentary will leave you cold. Everything in it rings false. The acting here is uniformly awful, but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good. But its not.#0
4975_1#After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of  Beowulf & Grendel,  which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. As soon as I heard  Viking  and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then theres Hrolfgars palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in  Kingdom of Heaven,  and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from  Beowulf & Grendel   Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I wont.#0
7018_10#It all starts with a suicide. Or is it a car crash? I guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. Director Gabriele Muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film Seven Pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning, showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. This is one powerful movie; maybe that is because Im a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk, dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances, but either way, a film works best when it truly touches me, when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. And this is from the team that brought us the overrated, sappy, and not all that redeeming Pursuit of Happiness, so Ill just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. With all that, though, I was with Seven Pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. Even though you figure out what Will Smiths character is doing, that secret mission he is trying to complete, it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end. The rest of the cast is stellar across the board. Woody Harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch-perfect handicap with a joy of life. His shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout, whether on the phone being yelled at, sitting in a diner eating his pie, or at the piano in the park, playing for all who will listen. Elpidia Carrillo, as the abused mother, is fantastic, showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger, allowing her family to finally be safe. And Rosario Dawson shines as the  once hot  young woman, beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays, all but given up on living life to find love and happiness. It is the introduction of Smiths Thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman, a free-spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last.#1
10618_8#Get this film if at all possible. You will find a really good performance by Barbara Bach, beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house, and an unexpected virtuoso performance by   The Unseen . I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Bach, whom Id just viewed in  The Spy Who Loved Me.  I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. So we start with a nice fresh premise. TV reporter Bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a California town, Solvang, that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. She brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. (The late Karen Lamm plays Bachs sister, and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to, it is just too funny watching Bach (Mrs. Ringo Starr) and Lamm (Mrs. Dennis Wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) Anyway  Bachs disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang, as hes not done arguing with her. Theres a lot of feeling still between them but she doesnt wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career. The ladies arrive in Solvang to do the assignment for their station, only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (Maybe to Bachs boyfriend, because think of it  wheres he gonna stay?). The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. Mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum, they catch the interest of proprietor Mr. Keller (the late Sidney Lassick), who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home, insisting his wife will be happy to receive them. Oh no! Next thing we know Keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife, warning her that companys coming and threatening that shed better play along. Trouble in paradise! The ladies are eager to settle in and get back to Solvang to shoot footage and interview Swedes, but one of the girls doesnt feel good. Bach and Lamm leave her behind, wondering to themselves about Mrs. Keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty Lelia Goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. Speaking of which  under-the-weather Vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub, not realizing that Keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. She hears him, thinks hes come to deliver linen, and calls out her thanks. Lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didnt get a long enough look. After hes left, poor Vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent, frightening round of action) by something BIG that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  The Unseen! Lamm comes home next (Bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and cant find anyone in the house. She knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen, and, on hands and knees to collect it, her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting The Unseen again! Well, at about the time poor Lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen, we do a flashback into Mr. Kellers past and get the full story of what his sick, sadistic background really is and why his wife doesnt smile much. Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. Meanwhile, Lassick has been apprised of the afternoons carnage by his weeping wife and decides he cant let Bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home. He tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the Keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us. I cannot say enough for Stephen Furst, whom Id never seen before; its obvious that he did his homework for this role, studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; Bach and Goldoni, each in their diverse way, just give the movie luster. Not only that, but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. No stupid cheap tricks, eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners A real treat for your collection.#1
5206_4#Adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because theyre two different mediums . Do you think its a great idea to make ZULU into a stage play ? Imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping   Blimey theres thousands of them out there   Great movie and a bad stage play  On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . The story revolves around a hit-man played by Palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by Cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . I was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which cant decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . Since the story is very static its of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give FAITHFUL a miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead#0

3293_10#If ever I was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years, then it would have to be  Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo  for its meaning, the way it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the lyrics by Kaif Bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars. The other would have to be  Chalte Chalte.  Pakeezah was Meena Kumaris last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen. In each of the the songs that are picturised, she looks young but after that she does not. But one actor who didnt change in his looks was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her and especially her feet, after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them, he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are. Kamal Amrohis grandson has now started to revive his grand fathers studio by making a comedy movie.#1
12270_4#This Kiyoshi Kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild, and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard. But all in all, the movie is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer, only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous Asian lady ghost, and has no idea why (and neither does the viewer). As other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, the lady ghost is more funny than anything, especially when she suddenly flies across the city, like Wonder Woman. And the ending makes little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense, and I cant recommend it at all. If it didnt take itself so serious, I would think it was supposed to be a black comedy. Outside of  Bright Future  this is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa I have seen yet.#0
1438_7#Full marks for Pacinos rendering of the speech over the dead kids coffin; Shakespeares Mark Antony would be put to shame  There is little else to talk about in this film; even John Cusack has done better roles than this one.

5370_4#Råzone is an awful movie! It is so simple. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in  krummernes Jul , and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie! all in all I think people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun #0

11197_1#What was the worst movie of 2003?  Cat in the Hat?   Gigli?  Mais non! I propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year. Badly written, badly edited, and (if I may be so bold) badly acted,  The Order  is the black hole of film - a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck. It isnt even accidentally funny, like (for example)  Showgirls.  If I utter any more, I would be in danger of generating spoilers. Frankly, the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created.#0

The  terrorists  are as scary and realistic as the  raptors  , this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh .The part where the giant T-REX who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending .If your into bad films , this is the pot of gold , the mona lisa of b-b-bad  #0
5818_7#Actually this movie has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and its much worse than other MJ movies like  The Wiz ,  Captain Eo  and  Ghosts . But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yeah, thats half my life, you guys!), I cant complain too much about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to Heaven for me. But as a movie, its not good at all, and Im afraid, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my darling Mike hadnt been the one starring in it. But since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker, it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me.#1
10833_3#I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost. I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end, little did I know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. My DVD player still hasnt forgiven me and I dont blame it one bit. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.#0
3152_9#This show was absolutely great, and I always look forward to watching it.All the characters were funny and awesome in their own way, each and every episode provided non-stop laughter, and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows.Everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny, that you couldnt help but love this show.There were a few dead weight episodes, but That 70s Show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere, to where it just really didnt matter.This was one of the best shows to ever be aired, and I will watch this show anytime I can, for it never gets old, never gets unfunny, and never gets uninteresting.#1

Then just as the band think things couldnt get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors have been locked so they cant get out & that they cant trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies.

11797_1#Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the biggest regret of my life. Who ever even thought about this movie, or financed deserves a kick between the legs, because thats where they were thinking when they made this movie. Its about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry. He joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls and such. Only the fat guy doesnt get a girl. Skin flicks dont annoy me, I take em for face value. But this movie tries to be more than a skin flick. Its about Fat guy looking for love in some girl, but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his lady anyways. The dialogue is super-horrible for even a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, its a glorified porno movie, without any porn in it. Never ever watch this movie.#0
4435_7#This is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time. It has all the right ingredients - a mystery corpse, a weary middle-aged cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his rookie sidekick Tobin (John Miles), a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the Tobin in the shape of a female botanist Mary (Patricia Wright) who helps solve the crime. Theres also a terrific shoot-out finale which takes place in a stone cutters yard. Watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where Lt. Corrigan refers to the dead woman as Tatooed Tilly BEFORE the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing huh?). Also later when Tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he didnt catch him!#1
10360_8#This is a docudrama story on the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society. It especially looks at the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas. I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to  play the best case for their character they could . While this is especially apt for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well.#1
9701_10#A fantastic show and an unrealized classic; The League of Gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times. The shows not without its drawbacks, and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place, but for the most part, the genius writing, dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters (that are often all too close to real life) make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent, catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame#1
11719_1#In the words of Charles Dances character in this film,  Bollocks!  No plot, no character development, and utterly unbelievable. Wesley Snipes character is totally unsympathetic - why should we care what happens to him? Direct to video? Direct to the dustbin #0
3081_2#Good grief! While I still maintain that Manos The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins came awfully close. Thisthisthing insults the audience at every opportunity. Its that bad.#0
6546_3#The old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in  Women in Love.  The script, taken from D. H. Lawrences novel, contains an endless flow of concepts that are, at best, sophomoric. A revisit in 2001 merely confirms a 1969 impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies, dawdling nowhere, and fumbling every step of the way.#0
21_4#What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didnt even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional. Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didnt sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like  Lets get the F$k out of here  and What are we going to do man . He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was funny to watch and it made me laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo Hoo ! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen. He will bounce back#0
11879_10#This is one of my all time favorites. Not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress,  Scarface  rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.#1
884_4#New York, I Love You, or rather should-be-titled Manhattan, I Love Looking At Your People In Sometimes Love, is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation. Case in point, look at two of the segments in the film, one where Ethan Hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy-talk, and another with Orlando Bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two Dostoyevsky books. While the latter isnt a great story by any stretch, its at least something that has a beginning, middle and end, as the composer tries to score, gets Dostoyevky dumped in his lap, and in the end gets some help (and maybe something more) from a girl hes been talking to as a liaison between him and the director. The Ethan Hawke scene, however, is like nothing, and feels like it, like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in (or, for that matter, Hawke with a combo of Before Sunrise and Reality Bites). So, basically, wait for TV, and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in, that is, for three scenes the aforementioned Bloom/Christina Ricci segment which is charming; the Brett Ratner directed segment (yes, X-Men 3 Brett Ratner) with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist; and Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. Everything else can be missed, even Natalie Portmans directorial debut, and the return of a Hughes brother (only one, Allan) to the screen. A mixed bag is putting it lightly its like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left.#0
6964_1#I usually check out the MTV movie awards to watch a witty, entertaining show that delivers a unique award show (Chewbacca winning a life-time achievement award as example). So this year was no different. While Im not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny-albiet stupid-to me. Ive laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies, and even enjoyed him in Dude Wheres My Car?. But the MTV movie awards were simply horrible. Nothing was coherrent, humorous, or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; he sure as hell cant act. I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of the speech by Gollam for Best Visual Performance. This was very creative, extremely well done, and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening.#0
121_10#Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. I think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters, and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions. 10/10 Dont miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors.#1
7809_1#Definitely an odd debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preachers home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything all better. Ahhif only everything in life were that easy. The fact that this  film  looks as if it was made with about $500 certainly doesnt help. 1/10#0
2259_9#I bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store. It was in almost mint condition, and Id never heard of it before. Clearly nobody else had either. #1
5688_2#Short Version Seed isnt worthless. Its just derivative and inferior. And soulless. Anyway, enough BS. Weak movie.#0
10257_8#what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said? well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks. how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know. im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was. however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real. and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me.#1
1083_10#Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant. A performance worthy of Oscar consideration, yet once again shunned by the Academy. Mr. Grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city. The pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis (loosely) for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle,  The Money Pit . If you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see.#1
9103_10#In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) such as a career, family, friendship, and love. In this way, we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small necessities. If you act in an inverse way, you will not have enough room for larger stones. The five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large  stones  in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish motion picture director defines his first feature Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel, conflicting trajectory of five women Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena, 1954-).All are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or, worst, that are in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Monica Cervera) who also stars in  20 Centimeters,   Busco,   Crimen Ferpecto,   Entre Vivir y Sonar,   Hongos,  and  Octavia.

1782_7#I have watched this movie three times. The last time, I kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot. Perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically. Or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because Anns recall of distant events is rather faulty. On another level, I enjoyed the films setting and music immensely. The seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Danes was luminous as the young Ann Grant. She is really quite a talented singer. I much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras. If only those pesky CGI fireflies would go away, I could raise the movie a whole point in my vote!#1
9321_1#I rented this movie roughly 4-5 years ago and was instantly disappointed. this movies production value, was laughable at best. There were no scares. It seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was all over the place, if existent. If you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one. There are much better b-movies out there.#0
11956_9#Id even say some shades of Hitchcockthis is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as a murder mystery? Anyhow, Woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one. The plot turns are nice and tight. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines, but stick around. Scarlett Johansson proves well-cast in the Diane Keaton-type role, and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older Woody. No one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.#1
9229_7# Flavia, la monaca muslmana  aka.  Flavia the Heretic  of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of Italian Exploitation cinema that, to a certain extent, follows a somewhat feminist premise (though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists). Set mostly in a convent, and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist (great performance by the wonderful Florinda Bolkan),  Flavia the Heretic  may be referred to as a Nunsploitation film. However, this film differs quite drastically from the typical Nunsploitation flicks from the time, as it doesnt so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism, sadistic lesbian punishments, etc. Personally, I saw more similarities to the Hexploitation flicks of the time, such as  Mark of The Devil , (even though this one doesnt treat the topic of witch-hunts), which focus on the brutal execution of Christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period. One thing is for sure,  Flavia the Heretic  is not for the faint-hearted, and neither is it for those who want happy endings. Director Gianfranco Mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible, especially in its nasty scenes. The many torture- and execution-scenes are extremely disturbing, with skinnings, spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail, the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film. The violence here is never superfluous, however. After all, this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in. The film is very well-made, with realistic costumes, fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by Nicola Piovani. The stunningly beautiful and great Florinda Bolkan has proved her talent in many great Italian cult-productions (including Lucio Fulcis Giallo-masterpiece  Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino  of 1972). She delivers another great, charismatic performance here, and I couldnt imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does. The film has some minor inconsistencies (E.g. why does the rigid church let bizarre cult-followers into convents in the first place). However, it is overall amazing how realistic this film is.  Flavia the Heretic  should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of Italian Exploitation Cinema. This is a great Exploitation flick overall, though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood. Highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema. 7.5/10#1
5358_1#Its obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts. Well, I dont know anyone involved, and Ive seen the final cut, and it is pure garbage. The only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends (none on screen for terribly long). Its as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks. This is an ultra-cheap, shot-on-video wannabe X-Files with terrible acting from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; its all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot. Ther computer FX are a joke, but there arent enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a MST3K way. After about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking, youll find yourself reaching for the fast-forward buttonand not letting go. Absolutely worthless.#0
7484_1#Within 15 minutes, my whole family was rooting for Goldie Hawns character to die, or at least for Steve Martins character to leave her. At 40 minutes, we turned it off. There are only a couple of movies a year we try that turn out so annoying that we cant even stomach it long enough for the story to get established. Normally I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoying the Neil Simon original. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of  Whats The Worst That Can Happen  and the writer of  Miss Congeniality 2 , and I guess this is what we end up with.#0
3889_2#I have always wanted to see this because I love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure  The Incredible Melting Man  would be a lot of fun. I realise Im making this movie sound rather fun. It would be if it were only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the Incredible Melting Dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion. I think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it, just dont have pop-tarts during the movie, because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end.#0
3382_10#Not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary. But clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition. #1
620_1#I saw this not too long ago, and I must say This movie is terrible. I watch crappy movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence). He has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings.  Everyone picks on me. The only girl that thinks Im not trailer-trash likes one of the guys that pick on me. I want to kill everybody. Wah.  OK, Im exaggerating. But the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies. This movie isnt nearly as good as Im making it out to be. If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, or if you enjoy watching bad movies, like I do, then watch this at your own risk. Everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times.#0
5157_1#I truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as I was a huge fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. Until this. This complete trash ruined Robin for me for a long time. Im only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in Fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake, Bicenntinial Man i think it was called but the point is. Robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this classic.#0
12113_1#Townies is the laziest movie I have ever seen, and I saw the Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). It seems confused in what it wants to be. Its not funny enough for comedy, its not tragic enough for drama, its not bloody enough for horror, and its not good enough for watching. It has scenes of a man doing  slapstick/bloody  karate so I think, oh this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicap) woman and a trusting mother. Then it slaps itself into the ONLY good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks. The part Im speaking of is a lonely TOWNIE who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse. That was the ONLY part of the movie that gave me ANY feeling. The rest was a waist of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is there is a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of the film of Wayne (the Director) making fun of Toby (the star) in public. It made me sick. Even though Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other movies by Wayne) arent the best, they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, it had some great lines I still use to this day. #0
8804_4#Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan.  Forrest seems to have made the  right  choices and been at the  right place at the right time  for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the directors vision seem to pay a heavy price. So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?#0
9922_4#Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but even I was left cold by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward  Behind the Music  style documentary. Rather it is a biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from  Animal Farm.  The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour. There have been better, more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loders narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90s come to mind.) Joe Strummer The Future Is Unwritten is for diehards only.#0
32_3#Sometime in 1998, Saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand-new Ninja Turtles live-action series. Naturally, being a fan of the TMNT back in the day, this obviously peaked my interest. So when I started watching the show to say I was disappointed by the end result is an understatement. Some time later (more like recently), I got a chance to revisit the series. Next Mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it. Given time and maybe another season, I really believe this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness. But while the idea was sound, the execution was flawed (although there are a couple good episodes in this series). As it stands, Next Mutation is one of those oddities in Turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten.#0
3559_10#I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. I thought the movie was well cast. I performed in regional versions of this and its one of my favorites of that period.#1
5097_1#Contrary to most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. Finally, since Im truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of dead-end plots, I cant help but wonder how many of them actually find it good, and how many say they do because theyve been told it is.#0
5731_7#It is said that David Lynchs films and shorts wont appeal to everyone. Neither will Dumbland, maybe more than ever. I have a feeling that Dumbland, as people come across it, will be a true mark of I get it or what the hell. Its not surrealism exactly, but absurd to the point of no return. Its also very, very, very stupid. But in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it, that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is, and this self-consciousness is a plus, not a detraction.  All the same Im still not sure if Dumbland is something I would put into someones hands if they havent seen much of Lynch yet let alone anything by him. There are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in Lynchs mind closer than we usually think to those in real life. However in general theres not a whole lot that should be read into it, which is why Id say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion. Those who dig the bottom-less pits of animated comedy, be prepared have a blast.#1
1445_2#OK. Not bad movie making if it were from an original script. BUT IT IS NOT! Which part of  in this story there are no women, except for Foulata and Gagoola  introduction by Haggard did the producers, directors and writers not understand? I mean, it is pretty plain English. I understood it at age 10!. The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, the colonial Africa, the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with. But, nooo, they have to throw  romance  into it. Pathetic. Suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book. Give it up. Until a Peter Jackson wannabe comes along and  does it right  you may as well keep re-reading the tome. BTW, there is a sequel book (actually a pre-quel) called Allans wife. It gives background to the story of Quatermain. It is a bit creepy but good.#0
3177_9#Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There is nothing i didnt like about this film. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job of, not only developing the main characters, but also the minor characters.  Cross Eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there. That you dont have to spend a lot to create something worth watching. There is something to like for everyone. If youve had a terrible roommate. if youve ever picked on a dork in high school. if youve ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have any type of sense of humor at all you will love this film. This is the type of film that will be around for a long time and ends up resurfacing again once Adam makes a bigger name for himself. I look forward to Adams future projects.#1
9992_10#this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss. Nice story, funny riches-to-rags situations, Mel Brooks is not a bad lead, maybe not perfect but he is funny ;D Dont pay attention to the rating, its BS. Watch it, then watch something like final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves about the same rating. If you do, I dont think we can be friends XD At this point I recommend the fourth season of  Curb Your Enthusiasm  to every Brooks fan ;) Vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms! Ive to make 10 lines here to post a comment? I dont wanna write a book here P#1
2421_9#You should not take what I am about to say lightly. Ive seen many, many films and have reviewed a great deal of them, in print. So when I tell you that this film has the single funniest scene I have ever seen in a movie, you might want to listen to me. Theres a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this INCREDIBLY stupid movie as funny as it is. And to those who just didnt get, well, I cant blame them, too much. The scene I speak of, comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to John Candy. Up until that point, I had found the film dumb, confusing and it was beginning to lose me. When this scene came up, I laughed so hard, I peed my pants. No movie has ever done that to me before. When the project began,  Going Berserk  was supposed to be the SCTV movie. I remember it being announced. As time went on, the cast was whittled down To John Candy, Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy. There also must have been a regime change at Universal, while it was being shot, because upon being released, it was shown in nearly ZERO theaters. When watching this a second time, I listened to the theme song (which actually flaunts how incomprehensible the plot is, in the lyrics), relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on. Aside from the aforementioned routine,  Going Berserk  has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it. This is almost a 3 Stooges flick, except its much funnier. Director David Steinberg has razor sharp timing, and he must have been laughing all through this. As for Candy, whos basically in charge here, he has NEVER been funnier. With all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out the window, he absolutely runs wild. Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. There is a plot, but its a plot like  Animal House  had a plot, and yeah, the script is uneven, and a little slow to start. Once you know this, however, you can well appreciate the full SCTV style craziness that transpires. It IS stupid, but its stupid on purpose, and you need to remember that when you see it. DO see it, and discover for yourself, if it has the funniest scene of all time in it.#1
3233_10#This is a top finnish film this year,although Tango Kabaree comes close.The Director Lampela made couple of years back another nice little film called Rakastin epätoivoista naista (I was in love with a desperate woman).Joki is truly true-to-life beautiful film of one saturday afternoon in a little village/town.The actors are maybe not so handsome or beautiful but they do act beautifully.I certainly do hope that many of them get JUSSI statue (finnish OSCAR) next spring.I think this film could make it abroad as well.#1
5720_10#I saw  The Grudge  yesterday, and wow I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror-movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many surprise-scenes (whats the English word?) that made you jump in your seat. Though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think the most scary scene was on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, or when Yokos walking without her chin. The make-up is also VERY good. Sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. The boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on. The next time I hear a cracking noise I will probably feel pretty scared#1
7322_2#Ill give credit where credit is due, and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who does what she wants. Shes brash, sassy, hard-edged, and very sexy; she is much better than this film deserves. Look for interesting but poorly-done cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and one really, really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Besides that, my first impulse would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else.#0
4898_7#A charming little film set in the UK about the reunion of a WWII all girl (almost) swing band. A fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by Dench and Laines always great  pipes . Time well spent and a fun watch for all.#1
8338_3#This movie is very important because suggested me this consideration sometimes you can wish to be sick  sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome  sometimes, for example, you can wish have Goldfield Syndrome that way youd not remember this boring movie  and above all youd not remember Adam  superfluos  Sandler sometimes, simply, you can wish have rented another movie My vote? 3 out of 10. My suggestion? If you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (its a joke dont exist Adam Sandlers fanI want to hope it), save yourself Someone to save? Drew Barrymore.  perhaps.#0
918_2#When George C. Scott played the title role in  Patton,  you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist, shooting at German dive bombers with a revolver, and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike. The most action we get from Gregory Peck as  MacArthur,  a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment, is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his. Ive never been sold by Pecks standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars; he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best-known roles. But its unfair to dock him so much here, as he gets little help defining MacArthur as anything other than a speechifying bore. Except for two scenes, one where he rails against the surrender of the Philippines ( He struck Old Glory and ran up a bedsheet! ) and another where he has a mini-breakdown while awaiting the U.S. invasion of Inchon, inveighing against Communists undermining him at the White House, Peck really plays Peck here, not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet  American Caesar.  The real MacArthur might have been worthy of such a comparison. What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown.#0
9973_8#I really liked this version of Vanishing Point as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as I did with the 1971 version) than to me, it is not all that great. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out. However, I have seen many remakes, where I have liked the original and older one better. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasnt so  blase .(Boring)#1
11698_3#This move reminded my of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. It has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve. I think thats always the them in a Crypt story. The same goes for the bad acting. Very bad acting. I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didnt like it and I wasnt expecting much. Whenever I watch a stephen King movie I dont expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels. I have read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such. It was so good. But I noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies. The endings were very different then the movie versions. I assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy. I ending of Thinner is the worst. So Cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the real ending. I suggest everyone who intends to read stephen Kings novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare. And that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book. I intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies. Im sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong.#0
426_7#Having ran across this film on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can think of no better way to spend a lazy Friday evening then putting in my two cents worth. Especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it. Doesnt every movie, good or bad deserve more than four comments? And this movie isnt bad at all. #1
6725_1#What could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row. Looking for a good story to boost his flagging career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert  rehab  Downey } gets to know him and tells his story. Taking every element of the classic  how we hit the skids  movies, borrowing very liberally from  A Beautiful Mind , taking the bogus  feel good  attitude of films like  Rocky -you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie. It is corny, trite, utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments. I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hated it, people will give you bad looks. I really wish I could say something positive about this film, but I really cant. The acting redeems it somewhat, but not enough for me to give it more than one star. Strictly made for TV movie stuff. Not worth your time.#0

3643_1#I am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence. The movie is false and phony because it is in complete contradiction of itself, which is what I tried to emphasize in my original review. The movie fails, not necessarily because I really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as  random  and doesnt follow through. Let me clarify. In Aileen Life and Death of a Serial Killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. The viewer can make the distinction however. In Zero Day, the 2 kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. Neo-nazism, talking about going on CNN with Wolf Blitzer (which is laughable not only because they know his name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movie)..etc. This movie doesnt depict reality, it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. Unfortunately you fell for the bait and didnt see this, and you didnt pick up on it from my review either. The entire movie is just taking Michael Moores hypothesis and applying it to something  real life  in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and doesnt support it. Of course I dont think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if Im not mistaken, didnt video tape exist of the Columbine kids (or some teen killers) shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the weaponry in Doom? Hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue. Zero Day is a bad movie not because I really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker doesnt know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove his point then support it. Its almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with Zero Day in retaliation. If you want to see the mindless teen killer theory pulled off right, go watch Bully.#0
2485_1#There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof it reminds you just how bad bad can be. We often see films which we describe as  pretty awful  or  not much good , but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films arent  good  they are no way as stinkingly bad as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It could have been a serendipitous find but it wasnt this is so utterly clichéd, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly acted that Im surprised everyone involved hasnt been arrested and sent down for 10 years. God, its awful. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. This isnt one of them. It is simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall throw it in the bin.#0
4989_3#Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you didnt like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel well, I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.#0

10023_9#After seeing several movies of Villaronga, I had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about a rhythm of the movie. That is why, though having good critics, his movies never caught the broad audience attention. In ARo he follows the same line, but really improved on the rhythm, especially in the end of the movie. Frankly speaking, I slept through the first part, cause though the first part gives necessary information, it is really slow. Nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga. Recommended.#1
890_9#This is one excellent Sammo Hung movie. Actually, this is a great piece of Hong Kong action cinema. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macao looking for love and getting mixed up w/ a vicious pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well-defined. The story is involving and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that hes probably the best fight choreographer in the business. The action is simply amazing, esp. the fight w/ Lau Kar Leung and the finale. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. A must see for any fan of action.#1
2572_1#this movie delivers. the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like hes never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off. stereotypical grilling dads, several plot lines that go nowhere, and a former seaQuest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect Saturday night at home.#0

But, especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre, its not one of her worst, either.#0
6873_1#The TV productions at the 2000s start were between weak and bad. Before marks like (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk) the TV didnt have the right hit yet, which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s viewer. Titles like (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) werent encouraging for you to watch and follow, or at least werent that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact its Men in Black meets The X Files spoof ! (As if these were the special unit 1). But even according to this brilliant formula; it didnt work well. It was promising; at the time there was some saturation out of the  supernatural  cases after a decade of many X files already, so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too (imagine Mulder as womanizer !). However (Special Unit 2) wasnt the strongest in this, or a strong when it comes to make a comic Sci-Fi show. It was highly ridiculous, where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one. It enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was all languid. Sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work. Its clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea. Among (Evan Katz)s other works as a co-writer and a co-producer like (Seven Days) before or (24) later this must be a low point !. Despite the distinctive personality, it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time. Therefore if that was there goal, so they made one of the silliest indeed ! And truly, it would be one of the rarest times to be thankful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it only  #0

1045_8#Lillian Hellman, one of Americas most famous women playwrights, was a woman with a mission. Her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country. In her memoir, she recounts her trip to the then, Soviet Union, as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system.  Watch on the Rhine  must have come as a result of those years. The left wing in America, as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism, not only in Europe, but in Japan as well. The film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule, no matter where.#1
3999_10#I am embarrassed to say that I missed  The Mother  when it was in theaters. I saw it this evening on DVD. I gave it a 10 vote, one of the very few I have given here. This English independent is filmed with such great care and quality. It drew me in relentlessly. The story, low-keyed and purely human, is brutally honest and utterly absorbing, thanks to the acting of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is stunning. The score is hard-wired to the plot. The storyline is epic, brilliantly clothed by writer Hanif Kureishi in mundane lives. This story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. And some of those big issues are highly controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards won, despite many nominations. It is simply one of my all-time favorite films.#1
10630_1#When I was 16 I saw the documentary  A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon . I actually liked, and believed in it for a couple of years. But then I grew up, and began to think, and when I had sought more information. This is more info from reel sources, and non-biased sources. When I started at university, not so long ago, i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories. What he said shocked me He said that all those theories where lies. That baffled me, I did not believe it first, but then he presented evidence for his claims. He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject  humans did not go to the moon . The most outrages claim was that the Apollo-craft could not travel through the Van-Allen-radiation-Belt, without the crew perishing from radiation. The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation. But I do not worry most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated, that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts. The fact remains Humans did walk on the moon.#0
4335_9#Oscar-caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar-caliber-written role. I loved the nuanced, balanced exploration of a long-time marriage - how often do we get that in films, where usually the movie ends when boy & girl get together? This is a movie for adults, a complex view through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story. On top of that, it gave me about 10 major belly laughs, and Im one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing. This was one of the few truly funny movies Ive seen. Great, original jokes.#1
7235_2#Not even Bob Hope, escorted by a raft of fine character actors, can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy, as his patented timing has little which which to work. The plot involves a Hollywood film star named Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonels daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Boltons agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, portrayed by Eddie Bracken, enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises, filmed in the Malibu, California, hills. Paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort, employing some of its top specialists, but direction by the usually reliable David Butler was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario. A shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton is still-born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence. Oddly, Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them. Dorothy Lamour looks lovely and acts nicely, as well, and it is ever a delight to see and hear Clarence Kolb, as her father, whose voice is unique on screen or radio, but there is little they can do to save this film, cursed as it is with an error in script assignment.#0
5953_1#How has this piece of crap stayed on TV this long? Its terrible. It makes me want to shoot someone. Its so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci-fi movie. Id rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense. I remember watching it when it first came out. I thought, hey this could be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously stupid it really was. It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table. Please people, stop watching this and all other reality shows, theyre the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.#0
8237_8#For the life of me, why did this film receive an R rating?! While it IS about flesh-eating zombies, believe it or not, its actually a pretty good family-friendly film--at least if your kids are age 10 and older. Unlike the traditional zombie films, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values--albeit a bit twisted! The language isnt a serious problem, there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids (much like the old TV show  Eerie, Indiana )--yet some knucklehead slapped an R rating one it! Believe me, most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film. This film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombies friend. Dad, on the other hand, isnt convinced--as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasnt yet gotten over this  Funny, irreverent and unique--this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience.#1
9471_1#Dont get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, theres Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless, but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didnt click. One of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and i hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original. The book was like an Ice Cream Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust. Avoid this like a leprous prostitute.#0
10038_10#Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (what movies dont) but still, its enjoyable. I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.#1
5362_8#THE RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, this isnt 2001, but its not meant to be. And the acting and script here isnt even up to par with other Arnie movies like PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I submit that the IDEA behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. A state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against  heroic  stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (the runners are equipped with none) in order to satisfy the publics lust for sport and blood. The ultimate prize for a winning runner freedom. Or so the rules claim. My favorite line  Guess its caused from steroids.  #1
5279_1#My friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end. It was just so boring and unoriginal. Not even the  hot  girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching. Everything was just predicable and annoying. Overall this movie can only be watched if by your self, to save any abuse from your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.#0
1895_3#1975s MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE is an amazing and wonderful film to watch. This isnt because the fighting is particularly inspired or because the film makes any sense at all. Its because the film is so silly and so over-the-top that it is a camp classic--bad, but enjoyably bad. The film stars a blind guy who has a Frisbee-like device on a chain that chops off peoples heads as he expertly throws this at his foes! Who cares that the physics are impossible or that the film features such silly things as fighters with 12 foot long papier-mache arms or that the guy was blind! Its just a ball to watch from start to finish--and one of my favorite  bad  films and great to see with friends. Overall, this is a film that martial arts fans may like (despite its many, many, many, many shortcomings), but also one that others will probably turn off or laugh hysterically at instead of enjoying the action because the film is just so ludicrous. BUT, most importantly, it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE. Too bad.#0
9640_2#I was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find, so when I stumbled upon it on Ebay I forked over the $10 and bought it, now I understand why its so rare! This film is SO bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits, which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines, are literally the movies highlight. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it, and gee, what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out, instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face, then escapes to a nearby city. But rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all its credibility LONG before then. This barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs, somebody needs to alert the producers of  Mystery Science Theater 3000  if they dont know about it already! 2 out 10, really, REALLY bad #0
7486_8#I for one really like this movie for some reasons Ill go into late but I want to touch on why I think people dont like it. First off, there are people out there who just like to hate Tom Cruise. I dont understand it really. Second, Cameron Crowe I think successfully p   es off two groups of movie-goers with this film. The casual, relaxed,  not looking to think too hard  group of movie-goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie. And the deep, philosophical, mystery-fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mystery. All in all, Id give it 3 out 4 stars. Its a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through, and a great story for those looking to relax. That  moderate  approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isnt a full blown mystery, or a full blown love story. It mixes and matches different elements and genres.#1
12089_4#I rented the video of  The Piano Teacher  knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box. I did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category. About one quarter of the way into it I found myself saying out loud,  This movie is boring.  About half way through I was saying to myself,  Where have I seen this before?  At the three quarters mark I had figured it out. Technically, the film is not without merit. There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Hupperts creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. This is the first of Hanekes films that Ive seen, and if I were to see more I expect I would have the same opinion of him that I have of Ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be. Rating 4/10.#0
7577_8#WHOS GOT THE GOLD? is (unfortunately) the last of the HANZO THE RAZOR films, starring Shintaro Katsu as the title character - the multi-weapon proficient, authority-bucking samurai officer with the  unique  technique of raping confessions out of unwilling female informants until they  spill the beans  and beg for more Not quite as strong and enjoyable as THE SNARE (part 2 of the series), but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and Japanese pinky-style films. 8/10#1
2997_1#This was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-make of Conan Doyles famous novel The Lost World. And it shows. Do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the Lost World. Unbelievably in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re-make.#0
6473_3#As a child the first installment ( The Little Mermaid ) was my favorite movie. It was filled with great characters, songs, and a fun family film. A week or so again I watched this movie for the first time. I believe that this movie was like most sequels and didnt surpass their original. I think that I feel this way possibly because I had high expectations and I have grown up. However, it is not a bad film. I dont want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out. I did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing. I think this is a good family film though overall #0
5710_1#Well it looked good on paper,Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again, this time on a mix of heist movie, Da Vinci Code,American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, this is to Indiana Jones what Speed 2 is to Speed. A reasonable cast(including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) battles against a puerile script and loses badly. The film is little more than an extended advert for the Freemasons.However these Freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and nobody mention From Hell or Jack the Ripper.)I dont think Ive revealed any plot spoilers because there are none. There is virtually no suspense, no surprises and no climax- it just stops. National Treasure aims for Dan Brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo sans the humour.#0
10440_1#Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except for the R rating), there are very few things to like here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings, but sadly, thats it. Poor plot. Poor acting. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are dismal. As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible. If we consider the action portions, well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan. This movie only contains the latter kind. This leaves little left. Im so glad I did not pay for this. I could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight, I witnessed a train wreck. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 of 10#0
9992_3#Ah yez, the Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another abominable movie. I was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where, as the survivors desperately searched for matches, at least a half dozen fires burned  with no apparent reason  at various points of the wreckage. Fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout. They searched corpses for lighters and matches, and finally finding a box built a fire every day for, apparently, 12, but no one ever gathered wood. Then when the vegan (hah) burned the bodies, what did she use for an accelerant? I mean these guys were frozen  well maybe not. Despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate, bled. Maybe its just me, but even in a totally unbelievable tale (none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti, or an abominable snowman, until the very end), if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable. Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the remainder of the movie? And the revolver, warm enough to hold in his hand, froze up and wouldnt fire. Gimme a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminently lovely Canadian lass. And, with little irony, Ed Marinaro as the coach. Well I might as well add, the rabbit they ate (despite it looking like chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now if it had been a squirrel (or a rat) it would have been a rodent, but it still looked like chicken. And the writers missed a real chance to have someone note  It tastes just like  #0

1566_8#Leslie Charteris series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady Simon Templar ( The Saint ) was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming George Sanders as Templar. It was a careful choice - Sanders usually would play villains with occasional  nice roles  (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY, the framed  best friend  of Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN). Here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his  heavy persona , while his good looks and suave behavior made Templar a fit shady hero like Chester Morris  Boston Blackie , and (to an extent) Peter Lorres  Mr. Moto .  On the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939. It will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory.#1
698_3#An uninteresting addition to the stalk n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980s. This was filmed as Pranks but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology The House That Dripped Blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie (she has also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II).#0
10053_8#I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as  Steamy Romance  I was a little bit skeptical.  Steamy ? In a movie from 1968?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot entirely in black & white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed. I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action Although it wont be all you expect, I dont think youll be too, too disappointed.#1
6636_3#Some of the worst, least natural acting performances Ive ever seen. Which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky, lame dialog given to the one note characters. Add to that the cheap production values and youve got a movie that doesnt look like it even belongs on television. One doesnt expect much from a Lifetime movie, especially one this old, but this is nearly unwatchably bad. Plot-wise, its a dreadful, clichéd romance of a type even Harlequin would consider beneath them. Its possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes. Surprise, the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love.#0
172_10#I saw this movie on Comedy Central a few times. This movie was pretty good. Its an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is arranged to marry the king of Ohtar, so that the U.S. can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including  Sunnygate.  I also just loved the ending theme. It gave me great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.#1

Kids humor always work. nice acting as well. simple story but cool shooting. nice job for directer to find the kids way. when it comes to the kid movie, i think of  12 and holding . another one this year but differed aspect to the kids world, which is real and cruel. awesome work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every kid and family need. p.s. Twitch, i think, is the voice of Nemo from  Finding Nemo .#1

3764_1#This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie Ive ever seen and quite possibly the overall worst movie Ive ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed like they were trying way too hard to play their roles as dorks, tough guys, jerks, know it alls, etc. And the bigfoot itself was terrible. It appeared to be some kind of computer generated image from the days of Atari & Intellivision. At one point near the end of the movie as an army of sasquatches were chasing after the remaining survivors, one gets shot and as its running it looked like a poor mans version of donkey kong himself! And one gets hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it was just awful animation. Another thing that was annoying was the music. Way way way too much music (classical score or whatever you call it) throughout the entire film. It was never ending. Oh yeah, the movie is boring too. Absolutely one of the worst films Ive ever seen. I highly recommend taking your $3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spending it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. TRULY AWFUL!#0
2320_10#Not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography (screenplay, acting, setting, etc.) but also for its realism. This movie could take place in any farm or rural setting. It makes no difference if the movie takes place in Louisiana or if it would take place in Kansas. The story and the messages it includes would remain the same. This movie shows family values and connections for an older audience, while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers. Everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally, I know I did. The ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time I watch it. The ending stresses the importance of farm safety, and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film. Not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations. #1
8258_9#At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing Im kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with Shaun of the Dead. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether Fido will appeal to you. So in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.#1
5073_7#This docu-drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us  Gandhi  beautifully photographed, compellingly casted, well written in the measured, literate manner that Hollywood discarded in the 30s, and scrupulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, excelling in its portrayal of native American (or, more appropriately for its Canadian setting,  First Nations ) culture and standing with  Black Robe  as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, circa 1934). This idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject Archie  Grey Owl  Belaney, a Scot raised in Hastings (England) by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the  red indian  tales of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared into the woods, and became a trapper and adopted son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides, none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it, for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character. One of his wives (one smarter than he, by most accounts) propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the North, and this forms the focus of Attenboroughs tale. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as Grey Owls wife Pony) is engaging and, if not firey, is nonetheless quite touching. A good film when you need some time from the madding crowd.#1
1740_3#The movie was a huge disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such dismal standards. Poor screenplay(almost non existent) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer. some of the scenes were funny, but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration. The editing was pathetic. Dismal! overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident. In fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval. One wouldnt miss anything at all if you dont watch the movie. Not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie. wait till it appears on TV#0
10714_8#The Scots excel at storytelling. The traditional sort. Many years after the event, I can still see in my minds eye an elderly lady, my friends mother, retelling the Battle of Culloden. She makes the characters come alive. Her passion is that of an eye-witness. One to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she lives. Seachd The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest, unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of Scotland ever made. Like Angus, I got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories. But, also like Angus, I forgave this once I saw the bigger picture. Forget the box-office pastiche of Braveheart and its like. You might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of The Wicker Man. To see a film that is true to Scotland, this one is probably unique. If you maybe meditate on it deeply enough, you might even re-evaluate the power of storytelling, and the age-old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced.#1
846_2#This has to be, by far, the absolute worst movie I have seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it I figured it couldnt be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films, and he was a pretty fair actor. WRONG! No one should waste their time on this film. I fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and I dont feel that I missed a thing.#0
8676_8#Tom the cat, Jerry the mouse, and Spike the Dog (here called Butch, his third name, his second being Killer) decide to sign a peace treaty to all love each other. Its weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their friends seem to think so too. But by the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak, everything is back to normal and all is how it should be. This short is the second one of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited and I have no clue why this one was. This cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of  Tom & Jerry   My Grade B#1
6114_7#A really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001-hit  My Sassy Girl  but is able to enchant most of the time. The biggest applause should go to the two leads. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and quirky, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. Well, I can make it short Nice film. My rating 7/10#1
1304_3#Very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. The performances are universally sub-par and wouldnt pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, theres no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. However, despite the films many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. The location shooting in New York City, and the films ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior  The Naked City , a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. Otherwise, its not much to write home about. It is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of 30s and 40s cars in the streets. .#0
3162_8#Over the years, weve seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what, keeping  8 Simple Rules  going after John Ritter died comes to mind, but this is probably the first time I cared. The idea of having  That 70s Show  without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous. They tried to cover it up with a comeback of Leo and increasingly outrageous story lines, but it always felt like why bother when you dont have a main character anymore. It just didnt really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasnt even funny. The last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now wed be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were. Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working, because the whole deal was that hed say something weird from out of nowhere, and you cant say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours. They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasnt a kid. Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door, you started praying it wasnt Randy, please let it not be Randy. The deal with Randy was that hed do really awful jokes, usually as Red would say, smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches. I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused. The problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasnt about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera. Everybody started being in love with everybody, emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea, with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching  As The World Turns . Im guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from  Family Matters . To be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either. By the way, yet more criticism on Season 8 what the hell was with the opening theme? Not only did they use the same joke twice (a character not singing), Fez scared the hell out of me. Dude, dont open your eyes that far. But the first five seasons or so,among the best comedy ever broadcast.#1
3536_10#EA have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60s world. The graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional. I got this game April 2007 (two years after release), and I am still impressed with the gameplay. Its a shame that EA will no longer make 007 games. I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the  consulate  level. I would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over. The only thing I didnt like in the game is the Russian boat level, it was too much pressure. On the whole I like the game A LOT #1
12456_3#Apparently Shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is. At one point in this film, someone (I believe Pacinos producer) warns him that film is getting off track, that it was once about how the masses think about Shakespeare through the vehicle of RICHARD III. Instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout. Some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for Al (was there really ANY reason for the quick visit to Shakespeares birthplace, other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there?), and, before the film has really even begun, we are treated to seeing Al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera. I thought his silly act with Kay near the end of GODFATHER III with the knife to his throat was AN ACT - but apparently its how Al really behaves in person. Its all just a bunch of sound and fury, signifying nada.#0
2093_3#If you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you, as fare as I am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I just cant watch it anymore. It is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100.000+ years ago if you base it on battlestar galacticas timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100.000 year old Chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100.000 year old popular name brand LCD T.V. sets. It also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show, there is just to much of todays stuff involved in it to not overlook, I think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad. As fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as BSG was and it is a poor pre sequel to it.#0
12447_4#Sondra Locke stinks in this film, but then she was an awful actress anyway. Unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including then =real life boyfriend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her. But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? One read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer. Its an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot at all. Add in bored, poor acting, even from the normally good Eastwood. Theres absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as I was concerned, this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers. Wow! Could a film BE any more boring? I think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun. A real stinker. Dont bother with this one.#0
9656_3#This movie has the made for TV stink all over it. Though, it started out with great intentions, featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes. The film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue, and rushed TV sappy melodramatic acting. The characters were so sappy that at times I thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo, and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another. The Germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch. The only thing that the German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word for this. I am a huge fan of the war genre, and this movie is crap. Nevertheless, this DVD does have an excellent extra feature, covering letters from the WWI front lines, thus making this rental not a total waste of my time.#0
8931_4#Anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that I love bad movies almost as much as I love great ones, and I can honestly say that I have finally seen one of the all-time legendary bad movies the almost indescribable mess that is MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. An adaptation of Gore Vidals best-selling book (he later disowned this film version), the star-studded MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end. The X-rated movie about sex change operations and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of its release. Not surprisingly, the film went on to gain a near-legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema, and I was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time. The rest of the cast is also fine. The endearingly over-the-top John Huston (who really should have been directing the picture) has some funny moments, Rex Reed isnt bad for a non-actor, and Farrah Fawcett is pleasantly fresh-faced and likable. Roger Herren is also fine, but he never appeared in another movie again after this (I guess he just couldnt live down being the guy who was rapped by Raquel Welch). And as anyone could guess from the description above, Mae West was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but thats part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema.#0
7598_1#It must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film. Probably Cruise, the Exec. Prod., saw what was happening and had Towne use much, much more of the nude footage in the final cut then Towne wanted to, to make up for the disaster he saw looming.(Maybe Cruise even thought of  Titanic .)A few items Colin Farrell cant act his way out of a paper bag. But hes one of the flavors-of-the-decade, a producers darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films. He has so many moments of not believing in what hes doing and you can see it in his eyes. I think he would have been at his best as a film actor, albeit not as rich or famous as he is now, playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act. The trap of spending a lot of money for period sets, costumes, cars, et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car wash/wax. No one seems to want anything to look, well, worn. Or dirty. Is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they didnt ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined items? This was a story about the depression-thirties folks, not a Disney Broadway musical about that era. How about doing it in black and white or better yet, given Caleb Deschanel as your D.P., have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times. It should have been, after all, a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did, in the Depression. More on Farrell. Did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer? H.L. Mencken on the wall; did I see his eyes roll at one point? Hayek and Farrell as a sexually dynamic duo? Sending a boy to do a mans work? Perhaps in the book, which I havent read, the story was about an older woman and a youth. I cannot delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because I bailed out early on. But the memory of the scenes I did see made me think that someone was doing a not-too-amusing parody of a noir movie. Sort of what Saturday Night Live has been like for the past decade not funny. (In my mind I kept thinking of a Guy Noir sketch, music and all.)#0
1258_9#As usual, Sean Connery does a great job. Lawrence Fishburn is good, but I have a hard time not seeing him as Ike Turner.#1
9717_3#A pretty obvious thriller-by-numbers, in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing. I was watching principally for the English-language performance by Isabelle Huppert. It wasnt great, but then it was a strange role. I wouldnt be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting-room floor along with several last minute script re-writes. The acting is the least appealing thing about this film. Steve Guttenburg looks like hes trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyones told him he has. Theres a sensationally stupid sequence in which its suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat PTSD. Its an uninteresting performance. Elizabeth McGovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but its small consolation. 3/10#0
11130_9#Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffmans performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesnt give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso.  I cant help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape.#1
8416_1#It makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes in Hollywood its all just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content. Yet, this film is overrated and overblown. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. No way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance so many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out. I cant even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace a nothing storyline. A bunch of songs does not a movie make.#0
10303_7#Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone Gods powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carreys facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10#1
6498_10#This should be required viewing for all young people. This is documentary at its best, from the haunting music and terrific narration by Olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses, The World at War is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about humanitys sorry experience at the nadir of the 20th century.#1
7975_8#I just love Malles documentaries. They are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It is about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you just cant help but also to fall in love with them too.  Unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened.#1
6641_8#On the 28th of December, 1895, in the Grand Café in Paris, film history was writing itself while Louis Lumière showed his short films, all single shots, to a paying audience. La Sortie des Usines Lumière was the first film to be played and I wish I was there, not only to see the film, but also the reactions of the audience. Whether this is the first film or not (some say LArrivée dun Train à la Ciotat was the first film Lumière recorded), it is an impressive piece of early cinema. Being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons. One simple reason it is only fifty seconds long. But also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here; you dont get to see historical things like this every day.#1
8775_3#LOC could have been a very well made movie on how the Kargil war was fought; it had the locations, the budget, and the skill to have been Indias  Saving Private Ryan  or  Black Hawk Down . Instead it come across as a bloated, 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie. Even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same hill in all their battle scenes, and spending unnecessary time on casual talk. Instead of trying to appeal to the indian public, a better movie would have been a to-the-book account of what happened at Kargil (like  Black Hawk Down ) or even spending time on the militant point of view (like  Tora, Tora, Tora ). Even better, it could have used a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct and edit the film. Until then, Id like to see some one re-edit this film, with only the pertinent portions included; it would make the movie more watchable.#0
4287_1#I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this 1 In short Dont waste time watching this movie, its not worth it#0
5748_10#This film was excellent - the emotional power of Tom Hulce and Ray Liottas performances brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this film had come out at the end of 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce would certainly have been at least nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. Definitely a must-see!#1
9153_1#I have never posted a review before, but I had to do it for this film! This film is SO bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it ISNT. It is truly, un-self-consciously BAD. This is a serious attempt that flops gloriously. Other reviewers have pointed out the films many flaws, so Ill try not to repeat these, but I do urge you to see this film. Throughout it I was either speechless, literally gasping with disbelief, or rolling on the floor in hysterics. I havent had so much fun watching a film in years. In fact, Im going to try to get all my friends to see it because its the kind of movie that needs to be shared. My favorite parts -- When Arthur auditions to be a go-go boy (his dancing is unbelievable) -- The gratuitous nudity (the director/leading actor just had to get a nude shot in) -- The preachers office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of Christ -- Of course, the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings (what narrative function does this play?!?) -- The ex-wifes wrestling match with Ben to get possession of her gun -- The detailed sequence wherein Arthur kills the preacher; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match -- Yes, the gay religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashions -- And, my favorite, the use of Joplins  The Entertainer  as the opening soundtrack and  Pachebels Canon in D Major  as the closing soundtrack! -- the list goes on and on -- a MUST SEE #0
6495_10#10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must see, with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years, untill this was screened in 1974. The film clips in this documentary from the war doesnt miss out anything, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. The whole series is over 20 episodes long, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war. Simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still, and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch. You must watch this at some time, even if its a few episodes, even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of WAR, in a WORLD AT WAR..#1
7617_3#It is one of the worst movies ive ever seen, but Hostel is definitely much more worse. This movie is more funny and ridiculous, than scary. I laughed most of the time when watched it. Low quality effects (when you gonna watch it, youll understand what im talking about and HOW LOW quality is that), bad actors (i hear of them for the first time), and it seems like its shot by an amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a TV show, than a movie). But at least ive had the patience to watch it till the end. Like comedies? Watch it. Wanna horror? Go watch Ju-On The Grudge or some other good horror movie. I rate it 3 out of 10#0
4836_8#I have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take (because of its length and story), I liked it very much. I was impressed first, by the script and then, by the realization of this script. The film takes you on a ride, but that is not an easy, joyful ride; it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary peoples lives. What I loved was the inner logic the film followed; logic, which just like logic in life, was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and twists made sense. It makes no sense though to try to re-tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time. I also liked very much Nikita Mikhalkovs character Aleksei and the way he played it, as some critics would saw, with restless abandon. What I didnt like about it, was that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksei in films like  Cruel Romance  (Zhestokij romans, which I actually love) and to some extent in  The Insulted and the Injured  ( Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye ).  Sibiriada  shows, I think, what a great film-maker Andrei Konchalovski was before he went to Hollywood and made forgettable films like  Tango and Cash  and less forgettable like  Runaway train . I would prefer  Kurochka Ryaba  to them#1
12277_10#Perhaps the best Isabel Allendes book, House of the Spirits describes an alternative chilean history, this one full of magic, a mystic veil, plus some kind of omnipresent sadness. This movie gathers a great cast, plus a great art direction, with a script that cannot contain all this books quality. Its unusual for a nearly unknown country like Chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie, whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high, and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset, mostly because they understood very little.#1
11065_2#This movie had so much potential. Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie its ridiculous. Too much time and effort was spent in the movie on Dahmers homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. Where was the character development? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals? Instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but fail to address the major point in Dahmers development. Also, the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh, etc. I could go on, but to sum up, too many lagging points in the film, focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is  Dahmer.  #0
3605_1#the cover of the box makes this movie look really good, dont be fooled. splatter university came out in 1984 which was the last good year for horror, but this movie sucks. the characters are so annoying. only the teacher is cool. there is like no plot to this movie, who the hell would ever produce this waste of a film? the teacher dies in this, and it was a female, we all know that we must have a female surviver, if youre going to break the rules do it in a good horror flick not this waste#0
5440_10#A trio of buddies, sergeants all in the British Army, carouse & brawl their way across Imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented, implacable guru. Now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment, the water carrier GUNGA DIN, to save scores of the Queens soldiers from certain massacre. The film picks its villains well. The demonic Thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840 the British military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion. Henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares.#1
1577_2#This 1997 film-blanc classic tale of smoldering passion has achieved its well-deserved legendary status as one of the screens greatest sagas of a doomed and hopeless love. The pervasive, ongoing and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and whats-her-name is sure to set many a viewers heart a-flutter with memories of ones own first crush. The brilliant screenplay dangles this embryonic affair-to-be in front of the enraptured audience, sitting transfixed as the abstract, almost-expressionist cinematography deep-focuses on the just-under-the-surface desires that ebb and flow between the principals. You can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron.  My one regret? That I didnt read the novel first.#0
3379_2#I recently bought the DVD, forgetting just how much I hated the movie version of  A Chorus Line.  Every change the director Attenborough made to the story failed. The only reason I give it a 2, is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the films attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.#0
7204_2#This is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible. Obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny. What is it with the talking car with buttons that say Wendys, McDonalds, M&Ms and Skittles? There was no talking car in the cartoon. (Dr.) Claw is supposed to be evil, not handsome and charming. Why is Rupert Everet Claw anyway? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It looks like they were (badly) lampooning Robo Cop, with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing. I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you dont get a refund. Im sorry I watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap. After I was told the no-refund policy, I decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called Inspector Gadget.#0
5301_8#In a very short time, the movie showed a boys odd life of taking pictures, showed his life and everyone elses get turned upside down as a result of his photographs, then brought everything back to normal in the end. One to see if youre looking for something interesting.#1
3885_1#This movie wasnt just bad - it was terrible. After I watched it, I actually felt the need to TAKE A SHOWER to get the filth off of me. There is running gag with an elderly couple making out, it is not funny, but it is disgusting. The monster make up was cool, but that is all. The continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least I was. The editing is really poor. Almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends are into bad movies this one is exceptional in its ineptitude, I couldnt even bring myself to laugh at it. You have been warned.#0
11438_1#If there has ever been a worse comedy than Gray Matters I am unaware of it. The New York Jewish comedys funny premise is that siblings Sam & Gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix Sam up with a girlfriend, only to find that Gray is equally attracted to their target - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing drunk act from Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance. Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under-employed and given nothing with which to work. The whole disaster is cemented by Grahams bizarre eye-rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar. It is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs.#0
3463_7#I am a big Beatles fan. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already knew quite a bit about the Beatles music and the truth behind the breakup, as well as things like John Lennons family and Pauls band Wings. I was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the breakup. The ending at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it the more you will appreciate it, especially since this was how it really went in real life. They also show the fantastic skit from  Saturday Night Live  in which the Beatles are offered $3,000 to perform on the show. (as compared to the $220 million others were offering them) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie. It does really give you more of a feel for why the Beatles broke up and why they never got back together.#1
4187_7#This is a pretty decent example of film noir. The setting is the early 50s with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government. I think noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this film. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone.#1
9843_1#It is only Robert De Niro film which I really hates. It is stupid film with horrible acting (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma must do his mafia films as always like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palmas Mission Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma two different times too, Greetings and The Wedding Party. I though that The Wedding Party was OK too (I didnt watch Greetings).  Screenplay is really bad and unfunny. There are no any scene where I can smile for even one time. Film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a  Be Black baby  scene and also I dont like the scene where a guys sexual organ appeared. So, it is one of the worst film I have ever seen! just worst. I hate that.#0
4342_1#I have to say this is one of the worst films Ive ever seen. They had a pretty good storyline to go on, but than the messed it up so badly. First of all the cast is all wrong, where did that van peeble(crap actor btw) and puff daddy come from??? It looks like Carlito has come from the hood, and used to hang about with some real idiots. This film doesnt do  Carlitos Way  any justice. Im so happy that the sequel  Carlitos Way  came out first, if I had seen this rubbish first, I would have never given the pacino version a chance. And anyway, pacino is supposed to have read this story, thought its crap and did the sequel instead. Carlitos Way Rise to Power - 1 out of 10. Carlitos Way - 9 out of 10.#0
4883_1#During the cheap filmed in video beginning of Crazy Fat Ethel II, I wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is mindlessly simple. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding. She is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into anothers soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food. Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then.well, you get the idea. If this all sounds like fun, it isnt. This film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. The characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store. To make matters worse, half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is little better. A VERY poor effort.#0
7052_8#Joshua Seftels first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is about just as the title suggests The corporations effect on War. Joshua Seftel does an excellent job insuring the films integrity; not reducing the material to the most redundant of films (which I was afraid would happen). Seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could he created a vibrant atmosphere, one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities; - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all. Seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. No missteps here. Hopefully, he takes on more directorial jobs, for he is one director to look out for.#1
8947_2#The book is fantastic, this film is not. There is no reason this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it, even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world. The bleak German expressionistic colours, the black and white footage from the vision screens, there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage. This film decides to take a mock-communistic approach to set design, atmosphere and theme, yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist, worship-the-humble-worker theme itself. This book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novels messages to the viewer.#0
3859_4#Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie just fails to make a connect.  There are some laughs to be sure and the cast (even if miscast) do their best with sub grade material which doesnt transcend its raunchy topic. So instead of getting a successful raunch fest (ie Animal House or American Pie) we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or something).#0
11201_1#Horrible waste of time - bad acting, plot, directing. This is the most boring movie EVER! There are bad movies that are fun (Freddy vs. Jason), and there are bad movies that are HORRIBLE. This one fits into the latter. Bottom Line - dont waste your time.#0
7862_4#Okay, lets not get confused here. If this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic, does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classics sequel? Heres to hoping thats not a general rule, as Wes Cravens own sequel to the original  The Hills have Eyes   released somewhere during the mid-80s  is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made. Part two didnt have an actual plot and re-used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise. Craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories, as the loyal German Shepard of the Carter family re-experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies. There were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well. The remake came out barely one year ago and heres the sequel already? The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script. Dont they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary, menacing and disturbing? With his excellent film, Alexandre Aja nearly single-handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes, as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for. Also, Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic  High Tension , but who is this new director? Ajas  The Hills Have Eyes  was an unexpected hit, appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over-enthusiast target groups. Its a really good film and, even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable, its highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Ajas smashing hit. Bearing all this in mind, plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism, I must admit this rushed sequel really isnt as awful as anticipated. The screenplay is routine and clichéd horror fodder, introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive-looking freaks. After the events of the first film, the US army has set up a camp in the middle of the New Mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests, which took place there in the 50s and 60s. For the horribly mutated survivors of the miners community that stayed there during the radioactive testing, the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck. They are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines. This basically is just another by-the-numbers slasher with dumb characters who are, even after losing several of their friends already, still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill. Its also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive, especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3-year-old son.  The Hills Have Eyes II  completely lacks  as to be expected  originality, logic and plausible situations. The mutated miners arent nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one, mainly because they arent organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex-hungry prototype monsters. Since you dont care for the amateur G.I. Joe  heroes  and definitely dont feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills, this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last years original. Most peculiarly, this second film isnt nearly as violent and gory as the first! Sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise-twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences, but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor. There are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics  mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns  but there sadly arent any outrageous pick-axe battles or virulent dog attacks. What a shame! Whats the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and/or gratuitous filth of the original? Luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental, and youll have the most fun spotting all the things that dont make the slightest bit of sense! For example, wallets falling out of peoples bloodied heads, women without any muscle power cast as tough-ass soldiers and  my personal favorite  assigning the ONE soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications.#0
1882_10#  The score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.The only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned.#1
10626_7#This is a decent little flick made in Michigan, about a guy that is haunted by his past, with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and has grown up not-so-well-adjusted. In fact, hes absolutely bonkers, but tries not to be too obvious. Hes got an entourage too, his own little demon & angel that follow him around. The demon never says a word but really, doesnt have to, and hes Max Schreck-creepy. Lets just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this, as Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like  freeing  people that he decides need it, mostly beautiful young women. This is a decent portrayal of madness, and youre kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of whats going on, but overall, I watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest. Its a little lacking in some areas but nothing I can really lay my finger on. A decent effort and worth seeing IF you like serial killer flicks.#1
12306_9#A Chinese Ghost Story stars the late, great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple, where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil tree spirit who feeds on chi (life force), he decides to try and free the girl by giving her remains a proper burial. Enlisting the help of Swordsman Yin (Wu ma), a crazy Taoist monk, Ling successfully defeats the tree spirit, but must also do battle in hell against the evil Lord Black, to whom Tsing is due to be wed. Two decades later, and this amazing movie still remains one of the finest examples of its genre that I have seena sumptuous, breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With superb direction from Siu-Tung Ching, excellent editing from David Wu, stunning cinematography, and a whole slew of imaginative special effects (including a humongous killer tongue, a many tentacled monster, and multiple flying heads!), A Chinese Ghost Story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish.#1
4943_2#I have watched 3 episodes of Caveman, and I have no idea why I continue except maybe waiting for it to get better.  I consider myself a pretty good reviewer, taking in everything, but I must say, Cavemen is comparable to the old show, My mother, the car. I give it a 2, only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it.#0
4897_8#This film pulls you in from the get-go because it grabs our attention by acknowledging, yeah, that this story is opening with a cliché  a funeral. The cast are a whos who of talent, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with her amazing high notes, a last performance from Joan Sims, brava Joan, a cute as a button flirtatious Ian Holm having a ball, and Olympia Dukakis as a money-grabbing divorcée living in the highlands of Scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey, The closing scene is standard Hollywoodland fare, the judgmental children of the star converted to fun-loving supporters, the old lovers reunited, the youngsters swept up in the old timers music. Life should be this simple. But I would watch it again, and intend to, with my own granddaughter. For in the right hands, sometimes one just loves these brazen old clichés. 8 out of 10.#1
1781_4#Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest. Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.#0

If you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits, you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcers voice-over, which states the U.S. has just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945 to end WWII. Here are just a few of the problems with this close  3)This end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about WWII, leading them to the conclusion that George W.

9473_10#I was lucky enough to see this at a pre-screening last night (Oct. 20) and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting. It was truly a delightful film, appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming. It was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films.#1
1619_10#Loretta Castorini (Cher)is a woman in her late thirties, a widow, who lives with her parents in a duplex apartment in Brooklyn. She is engaged to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), a bland man, more out of a resigned duty than actual love. Before their wedding Johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves Loretta the function of playing the olive leaf with his brother Ronny by notifying him of their impending wedding. Ronny (Nicholas Cage) hasnt forgiven Johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand (and subsequently, his then-bride-to-be), but he does fall for Loretta, and hard. After a heated affair Loretta out of respect for Johnny tries to avoid Ronny, but his dark looks and overpowering masculinity win her over. Meanwhile, Lorettas mother Rose Castorini (Olympia Dukakis) is not only suspecting her husband Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) is seeing another woman, but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women. Things get complicated when Johnny returns from Sicily to tell Loretta they cant be married. MOONSTRUCK is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice, but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people. The ending is a tour de force of emotional impact, the family situation going beyond the momentary complications to cement it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants, and is one that elevates this movie from being just another feel-good movie to a classic. MOONSTRUCK deservedly got its Oscars for Best Writing, Actress, and Supporting Actress, and has proved to grow beyond its time.#1
8859_10#The full title of this film is May you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows youre dead, a rewording of the old Irish toast May you have food and raiment, a soft pillow for your head; may you be 40 years in heaven, before the devil knows youre dead. First time screenwriter Kelly Masterson (with some modifications by director Sidney Lumet) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes. In this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but, here, very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward technique of storytelling. By repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale, we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong.  Each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances, and while we have come to expect that from Hoffman, Hawke, Tomei, Finney, Ryan, and Harris, it is the wise hand of direction from Sidney Lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect, a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be. Grady Harp#1
10344_7#Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in  The Amazing Mr. Williams,  a 1939 mystery/comedy thats quite good, although forgotten, probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939. One of the comments here trashed Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man. He wasnt lazy, but rather, a very hard-working actor (who made it look easy) who had a Broadway career simultaneously with his film career. He just wasnt cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system. I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in  Hud  and  I Never Sang for my Father  and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk.#1
8685_3#Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun (but rehashed and overdone) Bush jokes. Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even more. Do yourself a favor, skip  Lil Bush  and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy  Thats My Bush . Youll thank me.#0
12054_10#I first saw this movie here in the U.K. in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it. I still have the video tape, although worn out (over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been chilled by it!).  I have seen some comments on the movie which say its not this and not thatI think those people get scared by Friday 13th and the like, stalk and slash rammel, which are laughable. This is a traditional ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effectsno swearing, no blood, no gratuitous sex scenes, no chainsaws or guns etcSo how refreshing  Its atmospheric. IF you like chilling horror, well written, well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; only last night I saw the original Haunting and that is a superb movie. Very atmospheric again - and so is The Woman In Black. The end of the movie differs to the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try ityou  will  like it if you like traditional ghost storiesSOturn off the lights, turn up the fire, lock the doors, grab a drinkand enjoy )#1
6038_3#I had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes, and that is exactly what I was. I for one look forward to another film from these producers and directors.#0
9267_7#Not a bad film. Somehow I was made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I dont know anything about soccer and am not a fan. The ending on the bus was exhilarating. The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran, and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them get caught and detained. Its really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices, and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran once lived. One hopes that future will come sooner rather than later.#1
5255_4#Visually speaking, this film is stunning. It has some delightful black comedic moments. But on the whole, the plot is very clichéd, as is its seeming message. If youre a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw, youll love it. If youre looking for something at all high-brow, steer away. I saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it isnt disturbing. Just grinding and unpleasant to sit through. If you genuinely want to be challenged, go see something like The Lost. If you want to be grossed out, or tell your friends about a really messed up film, then this is for you.#0
3041_7#It is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film, whereas `Patton- Lust for Glory, producer Frank McCarthys earlier biography of a controversial American general from the Second World War, has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments. Like a previous reviewer, I am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other. On a pedantic note, the map which MacArthur is shown using during the Korean War shows the DMZ, the boundary between the two Korean states that did not come into existence until after the war. (The pre-war boundary was the 38th parallel). Also, I think that MacArthur was referring to the `tocsin of war. War may be toxic, but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin.#1
5245_8#I thought this movie was LOL funny. Its a fun, not to be taken seriously, movie about one mans twisted views on life, love, and well, ladies  from the lowly bus station skank, to the high-class débutante bus station skank.  Tim meadows plays a guy (Leon Phelps) who was raised by in a Playboy-style mansion by a Hugh Hefner-esquire father figure, surrounded constantly by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his  father  kicks him out on the street he must learn to fend for himself with nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life that his youth has taught him that and an unfathomable, nearly mystical level of charm and dumb luck. And so the hijinx begin! If you havent seen this movie and you enjoy a light-hearted, semi-mindless, comedy/love story, then I highly recommend renting  the Ladies Man .#1
5667_10#Definitely spoilers in this review! I   adore   American Gothic and have done since I first saw it late at night when it first aired on Ch4 in the UK when I was 14. The comparisons made to Stephen King are just about right. Its small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters. Best of all, and the reason I love it so much, is it had the guts to never be black and white! Lucas Buck though lacking any conscience often works by, as he says, giving people enough rope to hang themselves with. His manipulation only works because of other peoples weak morals. Caleb though generally a thoughtful, kind, insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father. None of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic Merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in The Plague Sower. Not only that but having Gail, the closest thing to a mother figure for Caleb, not only sleep with but fall in love with Lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it. Im a huge Buffy fan, but when that show tried to go really dark in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost its humorous side and didnt commit fully to its ideas. AG shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show, and still have a hell of laugh doing it. I would have done anything for a second season, but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some TV execs appear to be I should be glad this wonderful show got made at all #1
366_1#Bad Actors, bad filming, choppy dialog, shallow characters, but then again it was a bad premise in the first place. Basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges.  Overall 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film. I dont see how it only has a 4.4/10.#0
8319_10#I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time! This movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating  Dreamgirls  on Broadway, and Mariah Careys  Glitter,  25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to  Sparkle,  as well as in  Saturday Night Fever,   Fame,   Flashdance,  and the off-Broadway smash hit  Mama, I Want To Sing.  #1
7544_7#Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies like these, movies that ultimately end up on anime-fans hard-drives and college students floors, but get completely ignored by pretty much anybody outside of its country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed. Really, its just a beautifully detailed surrealist journey. --PolarisDiB#1
12242_3#I expected a bad movie, and got a bad movie. But I couldnt really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I dont even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about. Is not about blood surfing, but a big a$$ crocodile. They are complaining about the fake shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and didnt show the shark until the end. Here the crocodile is shown a lot of times, and its the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen, and they dont try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid.  3/10 because Im in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good (but is bad actress,)and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sht they had to work with.#0
10519_9#Im a huge Jane Austen fan and besides being a feature-length film (a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini-series) it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well-intentioned rich girl and Jeremy Northam IS Mr. Knightly with his poise and nobility. I wasnt thrilled with Ewan McGregor even though I like him very much as an actor but didnt feel it spoiled the movie at all. Like I said, as a Jane Austen fan there were things I would have liked to have seen included that werent but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was I felt they really encapsulated the story well. Ive seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one!#1
11821_2#Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. Ive seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - its awful in almost every way editing, pacing, storyline, acting, soundtrack (the films only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film.  The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.#0
3733_1#Weak,stale, tired, cliched; wants to be Basic Instinct, but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives, new insights. Insipid, trite, grotesque, and without the possibly-redeeming value of brevity; oh, waitit was only 90 minutes longit must have just  seemed  a lot longer! Id rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again. Im expressing an opinion here I guess this means I didnt like it.#0
861_7#What can you say when you see a good French movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters? The major point is we believe in those characters and once theyve met each other we want them to stay together. Its simple and really efficient. The background story is less important. Why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller? It helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most French film-jerkers like to make. Not too much ambition, right Sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining French film with good characterization. For all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy. It goes quite as easy as in Rear Window (an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film) but with a less compelling context. Where I am amazed its to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. He brings very little to the story; when he appears alone we wonder if weve not missed a part before. Jacques Audiard is not a new-comer yet. Strange and weird.#1
5551_7#I really wanted to like this film and I dont think I was terribly disappointed. Being an American History teacher, I felt an obligation, almost, to see this film and as far as the history went, it wasnt bad. Sure there were a few mistakes here and there (especially with the timeline--the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year--not over six years of actual fighting), but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent. Unfortunately, the movie ALSO included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich Loyalist. For the most part, it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed  tacked on --like a plot device instead of a real honest-to-goodness romance. In fact, as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb cliché of  love at fist sight , it was kind of annoying the more I think about it. PS--Despite me liking this film and some other of Griffiths films, he DOES deserve to once again  burn in hell  for his having White actors portray all the Black servants in the film! This is a sick and bigoted thing that Griffith did in so many of his films--especially in BIRTH OF A NATION. I gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays Blacks that he was A-OK with slavery and was quite the apologist for this  quaint institution  (dont get mad at me--this IS meant as sarcasm).#1
1056_3#Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets. This is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the  see it again and again  category.#0
12292_10#I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné almost everything has already been said about the movie, but there is one detail Id like to shed some light onto no footage of the real, still standing, Hôtel du Nord (is it still? I heard it was to be demolished) has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on set, the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks.#1
8937_1#Generally I like horror movies, but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand. We sat down to watch it, ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much. The concept isnt that bad, but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky I dont know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The camera work was poor, the special effects are actually not bad if I am being generous, but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm. They were wooden beyond measure, especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent. He looked more like a public school boy in fact. There was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical, but then I remembered it wasnt supposed to be a comedy. Im desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but there simply isnt. Lets hope ten was the lucky number and they dont do another one, Im not sure my ribs could take it.#0
4380_8#This is a very good, under-rated action/drama/and slightly historical movie. All in all just shy of a classic.#1
440_10#My all-time favorite movie. Oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. It is Josie Lawrences best work by far, and transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright. Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I can find no fault in it. The music, by famed composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel.#1
1441_9#In a performance both volatile and graceful, Al Pacino re-teams with Sea of Love director, Harold Becker. And the power behind power.#1
7161_9#Loved the movie. Loved the two families crossing paths in history. Only question is if Sam gets killed then how does his familys line continue? He is Madame Zeronis son and Zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. Just loved it. The acting was great. Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier. The other  counseler  did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much. Poor Warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up.#1

841_1#I just watched this film 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just watched. Mainly I think its a film about an internet S&M  star  of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online. Shes murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death. The local homicide division of Big City, USA is also investigating, though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic  as the real thing . I know. Wow. All in all, stay away from this film. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. Like, playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.#0

As lawyer boyfriend Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) goes about making inquiries on her behalf, she struggles to maintain her sanity (not to mention her will to live) as her experiences take a toll on her physical, mental, and emotional health. 7/10#1
11004_1#It really impresses me that it got made. The director/writer/actor must be really charismatic in reality. I can think of no other way itd pass script stage. What I want you to consider is thiswhile watching the films I was feeling sorry for the actors. It felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying. Id really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor. I want to write the jokes didnt appeal to me. but the reality is for them to appeal to you, youd have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard. So imagine that in script formand this guy got THAT green lit. Thats impressive isnt it?#0
9766_9#Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy THE MOVIE is about dolls that come to life when the humans arent around. In this adventure they must rescue a kidnapped french doll named Babette from the captain of pirates. On their way they journey though Deep Dark Woods, Taffy Pit, and even Looney Land. Will the aide of their new friend The Camel With Wrinkled Knees help them or just slow them down with his hallucinations of his friends leaving him? How will they escape the Kookoo king and his henchmen!? What will their owner Marcella say when she sees her 7th birthday present doll gone along with her other toys? Delightful surprises await the two adventurers. Overall Score (Not an average) 8 - Its a wonderful timeless musical made in the late 70s and can still be enjoyed today. Its characters are all unique and the songs are great. So great you might find yourself humming them time and time again. Give your favorite stuffed animal a hug today! Reviewers Insight (Including bias) This isnt like the Raggedy Ann TV series made a decade later. This was way more darker and real world. The effects in this seem like a lot of other acid-trip cartoons from the 70s, in particular, Yellow Submarine. Still, its given me memories Ill never forget, and might still influence things today. It wasnt easy to find but itll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of DVDs and videos forever.#1
2631_1#A bum gives a Secret Serviceman a tip about a Secret Service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president. Baloney. How did the bum know? The script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the Secret Service works, but who cares. Most of this just slows down the movie. All the chases that follow are this films version of the tiresome car chases of many movies. Then, after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and out-guns all his buddies, we have a shootout in the Toronto City Hall. The Canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs, but how did they get into this? Finally, all is worked out. But it still makes no sense.#0
2239_7#I guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of Lord of the Rings. Well, so I was. And so I really love this movie. Especially I like all those flawless superheroes from LotR being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied. Most brilliantly is the counterpart of Gandalf (the brave and wise and completely humorless know-it-all wizard) Almghandi, the cowardice and brain dead transvestite. Saurons counterpart ( Sauraus  from East Germany, of course) is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet. Aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ( Ulrike  the legend) with scotch tape. And  Strunzdumm  (the counterpart of Wormtong) indeed has some strong resemblance with Brad Dourif! And dont forget Grmpfli and Heidi huh-huh#1

10065_2#Much worse than the original. It was actually  painful  to sit through, and it barely held my six year olds interest. Introduction of some new Pokemon is marginally interesting, but storyline is extra-thin, dialogue is still bad, and music is mediocre. Watch the television show instead - its much better.#0
6645_8#An ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. Or at least that is what Lara Flynn Boyles character, Col Kennedy, argues. After a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door, Col knows something has got to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect. Barring Boyles presence, not much is happening here, as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. The cinematography lends the film a polished look. 8/10 on account of Boyle, the premise of an evil ultra-modern house, the locations and cinematography, and set decoration and wardrobe.#1
11753_1#tries to be funny and fails miserably. The animation is just terrible, looks like a 2 year old threw it together in his sleep. Plot is dull and cliched. IF you have a young child, maybe rent it. but dont waste hard earned money to pay to see it. 1/10#0
199_1#This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line. The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldnt every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.#0

11063_3#I do have the `guts to inform you to please stay away from `Dahmer, the biographical film based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer. `Dahmer strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts, was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful `dahm project. This is not an easy film to digest, even though Jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery `brainsadillas appetizers or even some real-life `Mr. Potato skins.   Failure#0
10223_10# some spoilers  The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he frantically reaches for it as if hes finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte wasnt allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fannys health or Mostels faith), so he never got his wings. The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostels grasp, a metaphor for both mens live its too late and you dont get a second chance. Like  Its a Wonderful life,  this movie is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.#1
7790_2#Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about itbefore I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas cant overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched special effects. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldons original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.#0
7299_1#Sure Ive seen bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that I actually became angry in the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket, of course I didnt receive a refund (or even a reply) but its the point that matters. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a -42. Why did the  Jeep  (Chevy Blazer??) stop running from being hit with a bat? Why did they hit the  Jeep (Chevy Blazer?????) with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bums skull? The plot was thin, the movie filled with obvious clichés, and certain parts of it just didnt make any sense.#0
7173_10#I just watched the documentary  Fog City Mavericks  on the Starz cable TV network. It is without a doubt, one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! It chronicles the San Francisco Bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the some of the best films ever made. In addition to the well-known artists listed, t also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment about Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD-this is a must for any collection about cinema history and brilliant film-making. If you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.#1
11956_3#This movie stinks. I dont think I have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland. This could have been an a good movie. I think it just relied on its grotesque visuals. I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it felt like Miike shot it for the sake of shooting it. Just one poorly executed film. There just isnt anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self milking, parental and sibling abuse, and fecal dispersement. I think I just sold the film to many of you, but I meant it when i said this stinks. He has succeeded in other films, but I think youd be better off watching someone pooping.#0
10515_9#A slight, charming little movie to be sure, but a superbly-crafted one. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and Im sure I dont know why that one garnered all the Oscar attention. Emma is Jane Austens most accessible and least stuffy story, told well.#1

If you like Kung Fu you would love this #1

1199_10#This is the most compelling and excellent performance that Robert Taylor ever gave. It even surpasses his wonderful performance as  Johnny Eager  coming a full 14 years after that film. His looks are still a wonder to see, but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure. His wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings, is stunning to watch. He is basically a lonely man, needing the people around him, but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is sick of the hunt, and only goes along, because he is a failure at anything else. Along the way Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her to no avail, but sees that Sandy is interested in her also. Granger is kind of sad to watch, so fed up with the hunt, longing to go away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing. Russ Tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world. The group is an odd mix of good and evil, young and old. In the end Taylor gets spooked by the buffalo, as many hunters before him had, and runs off leaving Sandy with the girl. Upon his return, that night Sandy leaves with the woman, setting Charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get Sandy and have the girl for himself. The final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It is Taylors film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era.#1

4860_2#Horrible, horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! I am, of course, speaking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I was exclusively talking about those seasons, this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good. They were, and are, awful. The comedy is not funny at all. AT ALL   The original cast was full of very talented comedians, like Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr, and Mary Schorr (or whatever her name is), all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left MAD TV. This show is highly overrated, and less worthy of your channel surfing time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Go out on Saturday night and have fun, and leave MAD TV to wither and die, as it deserves to.#0
5579_2#The 60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. If done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. The acting wasnt extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960s? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to not waste your time on The 60s and do something else with your time. Im glad I watched this in class, and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylans music. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.#0
9362_7#Greetings again from the darkness. How rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler stars as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy, and has since lost his career, his reason to live and arguably, his sanity. Don Cheadle co-stars as Sandlers former Dental School roommate who appears to have the perfect life (that Sandler apparently had prior to 9/11). The film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined. In addition to the interesting story and some great shots of NYC, you have to love any film that features vocals from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey  as well as Eddie Vedder impersonating Daltrey. Not exactly a chipper upbeat film, but it is a quality film with an unusual story.#1
8244_1#I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly its been made and simply is. Its one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). My advise Dont watch this under ANY circumstances.#0
7573_9#One of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed. Great storyline with a romantic, horrific, and ironic plot.

Dont miss out on the best of the series.#1
1886_1#I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity dont exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isnt social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And this is why this film is truly despicable.#0
1300_1#This film should have never been made. Honestly, I must admit that before I saw it I had some serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, though she did a lot of movies in Holland, and the young woman who took the main part is a TV-personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other main part I recently saw in Bride Flight and although that film is better, he did not convince me than. To start with the the story, I have not read the novel it is based upon, but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues, it was most of the time spoken out loud. My regards go to the cameraman, at least he tried to make something out of it. It is a pity that the film is edited lousy, if not, some scenes were certainly more credible.#0
2036_4#The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares for the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients. Around the same time he decides to model his killing after the Zodiac Killer of the 60s. He gets in touch with the author of a book about the Zodiac Killer and they form a friendship. Michael has a gun (aparently the only gun, as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors, only not portrayed as the same gun.) and he goes out a-killin. Original.  This is a great film if you like B movies. I thought the idea of the movie was good, but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot. I thought the blood was just too fake, the lighting was horrible in some places, and the dialog was just too standard. The movie was shot on video, which is okay, but the editing of the film just made for some weird Plan 9 scenes. Not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something with a bit more polish, move on to something else.#0
1576_1#this film has it all; the deft camera work, reminiscent of martin scorcese, or oliver stone, the tight acting of heat, the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie, the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feel of say, the godfather overall, great acting from its a list cast (like an oscars night party invitation list!), classy locations, gripping action, and a tight script.#0
3201_2#Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and therehe was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he cant do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Dons partner is killed so he kills the killers brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite bad and you wont find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Dons character. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.#0
5877_8#Okay this movie fine like I said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch . Its about two boys Mac and Sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when Mac ( Akshay Kumar ) starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious . Sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely . But Mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses . theres garam masala at every step of the movie , songs rock but somethings lacking . The comedys not up to the mark and deserves an award . Its nice but not all that excellent . Some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didnt deserve that many laughs . But of course everyones opinion is different . So if you wanna watch the movie youre welcome to do so .#1

11054_7#My siblings and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970s. We absolutely adored it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual American re-runs (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres you get the idea). It had a similar feel to The Avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also British and in the spy/adventure genre). I would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up. Ive mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if Id imagined its whole existence. But the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.#1
12412_9#What we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise, a cast that is filled with familiar faces AND one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films. Socould anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated???  Prison  is the Finnish director Harlins American debut, which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like  Die Hard 2 ,  Cliffhanger  and  Deep Blue Sea . The story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle Wyoming prison, re-opened for the cause of over-population in other, more modern state penitentiaries. Inside the former execution dungeons, the restless spirit of the electric chairs last victim still dwells around. The now promoted warden Eaton Sharpe (Lane Smith) was there already 40 years ago, when this innocent man was put to death, and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial. It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived. Viggo Mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and Chelsea Field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past.  Prison  contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but its the unbearably tense atmosphere thatll stick to you for certain! Unlike any other horror picture from that decade,  Prison  features an amazing sense of realism! By this, I refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls, of course, and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed even though these are genuinely unsettling as well. The films best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror. The absolute best terror-moment (providing me with nightmares ever since I saw it at rather young age) focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire. Haunting  The screenplay only suffers one flaw, but thats a common onealmost inevitable, I guess clichés! The story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding. Weve got the ugly, fat pervert with his cute boy-toy, the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old n wise black con who serves a lifetime (did I hear anybody yell the name Morgan Freeman?) Dont stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise, as there are so many other elements to admire. The photography is dark and moist, the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class B-actors are excellent (the fans will recognize Tom Everett, Tom Tiny Lister and even immortal horror icon Kane Hodder). Forget about Wes Cravens god-awful attempt  Shocker  or the downright pathetic cheese-flick  the Chair . This is the only prison chiller worth tracking down! Especially considering Viggo Mortensen peaking popularity nowadays (I heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves, Hobbits and other fairy creatures) this true 80s horror gem oughts to get an urgent DVD-release #1
11300_8#Ossessione Luchino Viscontis debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Viscontis compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, its incisive and essential, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.#1
2152_1#this film tries to be immensely clever, and Tarantino-like  this film is rubbish. its all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a 6.8 rating. the film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired porno!#0
646_9#A have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an SOB who has a long term girlfriend. Of course the SOB is very good-looking, charming, etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching Jean Pierre Leauds character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends. Its tragic, and you know shes going to end up very hurt, but theres nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Totally empty. A blank throughout, he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants. Its a long film, but see it in one go, preferably in a cinema. Takes a while to get into, but then the time just disappears.#1
506_2#(aka The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance) Pretty boring 2 out of 10#0
455_4#Even thought Im not the biggest of Cher fans, this movie was her crowning achievement. Granted, there were long term side-effects and risks of brain damage, memory loss (and) intellectual impairment, upon the screening such a film. A 1989 survey of Moonstruck fans by the UK Advocacy Network revealed that one-third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed Moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds. Assuming free and fully informed Consent, it is well to reaffirm the individuals right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses. But we might ask ourselves whether we, as fans of cinema, though in no way sworn to any Hippocratic Oath, should be offering it.#0
10131_1#Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question What is the worst movie ever madeever? It is Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are lots of famously bad movies, but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously. It was released only on video (I cant imagine why) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVDs had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling.#0
12305_8#Wasnt quite sure what to expect with this one, outside of the uniform positive reviews Ive read. Turns out, I could have never imagined this movie, because its very close to  The Bride with White Hair  in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic. This walks a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling. Theres nothing scary about it, thats not the theme, its really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost, who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. This also takes place in ancient China, with wild outlandish Kung Fu exhibitions, and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are top rate all the way. I could watch this genre of Chinese movies all day, because they are highly entertaining, great visuals, and pretty much tongue-in-cheek. And Im looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also. Highly recommended.#1
5338_2#Elvis Presley plays a  half-breed  Native American ( Indian ) who has to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight, and make children. Fighting, wrestling, and  punching out  each other replace the stereotypical hand-raised expression  How ?    Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell#0
8614_9#The movie held my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted. I had no trouble following it (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). The movie was very sad and touching as well. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a fine new talent (beautiful too), and Tom Everett Scott does an excellent job with his part as well. The relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not. It was tragically sad but enlightening. It sure beat the other shows that were on TV New Years Day evening#1
9522_1#Wow! I remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s. They usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students. As I watched this film I felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s. However, then I find out that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools. Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise $200,000. So the seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you raise $200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in? And why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out? Andahh forget it, this film was stupid and made in 1989!?#0
3623_8#Disney might just be on to something here. First, they had  Remember the Titans  with Denzel, a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie yet another sports story based on truth. Both movies move you to tears at times, and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them. My wife and I took in The Rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie. We were not let down, when asked if wed be buying this on DVD when it comes out, it was a no-brainer. Most definately.#1
2344_9#Im one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid. The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying. All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that Ive seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.#1
1719_7#By 1909, D.W. Griffith had been directing films for the Biograph Company for about a year, and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker. The Sealed Room is a very interesting 11 minute short, a fascinating piece of Gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror. The simple narrative was probably inspired by Edgar Allen Poes 1846 short story,  The Cask of Amontillado,  and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wifes infidelity. Despite these innovations, The Sealed Room suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era. The entire film takes place in just two rooms, with footage captured from a total of just three positions, and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times. The acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect, however, at least in the case of Arthur V. Johnson, his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king. A moment that I thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room, only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone. Their panicked reactions, accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king, serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia. I did think, however, that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly.#1
860_1#Kubrick meets King. It sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the movie came out, and the Kubrick cultists have been bickering with the King cultists ever since. This movie simply doesnt succeed -- not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. It probably merits a 3 out of 10, but Im giving it a 1 because it has been so GROTESQUELY over-rated in this forum.#0
3126_10#I dont hand out ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Furthermore, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours. I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it is genius. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie, and altogether, an unforgettable trilogy.#1
8339_10#I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) really was a dull guy. To me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. Anyway, everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who hasnt seen it. Youre in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.#1
9345_1#I feel like Ive been had, the con is on, dont fall for it. After reading glowing reviews (the Director was a film reviewer with Sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews) I expected solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, an intriguing plot development and poetic moments. Sadly, Sixteen years of Alcohol, doesnt deliver on the critics promises, for the most part, sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects (what was that clichéd cobweb scene in there for?), unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration, cliché edits and camera angles. 1.5/10#0
4126_8#What a night. Perry Mason then Have Gun, Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke (when it was a half hour) and finally at 1030PM came Sea Hunt with its wonderful opening theme music and Mikes boat sailing off to a new adventure. Terrific.. Regardless of the story it was the lead character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A Mans Man and a Boys Man. This brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years. Why they dont show on cable or make it available on video, no idea.. Too bad.#1
6604_3#The first one was the best. The second one sucked because the dialog was terrible. Although, the storyline wasnt so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). Throughout the movie, I dosed off a few times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expertise, but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker, too, wasnt good. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible acting (But thats based on her script). All the characters there were not that good. But, some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan doesnt do those things which is good for him.#0
8556_7#This movie is plain fun.I has nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it is fun to watch. So, lay back and just enjoy.#1
2775_7#Old movie buffs will know why Id call this one  The Man in the Grey Flannel Robe.  Most Bible-based movies are basically schlock- what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how Peck, tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying Neanderthals all about him. As a Great Romance, it falls flat as unleavened bread. But there is something gripping about this movie. Of all the big Hollywood Bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the Average American towards belief in the Biblical God. Billy Sundays thesis is duking it out with H.L. Menckens antithesis all through the script. Who gets the better of it in the Heavenly Chorus-backed synthesis depends on your point of view. Other than that, D & B boasts a good performances by Peck ( especially in the closing repentance scene) and by Jayne Meadows as his bitter first wife Michol, vivid, moody atmosphere (good idea to set most action at dawn or night), and the rousing rendition of the Twenty-Third Psalm at the end.#1
270_1#Im watching it now on pink (Serbia TV station) and I must say this is a crap. Shallow, no acting, effects too sloppy I mean, who made this series? The film was the bomb, the series suck.#0
3138_1#I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The acting was sub-par at best. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of peoples minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didnt even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you dont because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?). Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor outdid it in the  Nothing to Do With Reality  department.#0
12075_1#This Hamlet made for one of the boringest MST3000 episodes ever. I am not a Shakespear fan, but I do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab. It is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed. Like I said though this one is quite boring. It is in black and white, the pacing is slow, and there is minimal scenery. The actors are all dubbed too so that doesnt help. This is the one MST 3000 I cant watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing Hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep.#0
4656_4#Unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old, celebrated English film. Although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster (which it is not), it never builds any tension and betrays its TV origins. Richard Burton sleepwalks through his role, and Sophia Lorens closed (in this movie) face doesnt display much passion, either. (  )#0
8053_8#This is of of Sammos great early comedy films. This isnt a parody of enter the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size. Nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. Oh, the fighting. Good, fast-paced scenes with high impact (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of Sammos kicks). This is one is for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan.#1
8996_1#In the future of 1985, a governmental committee headed by Howard Hesseman, is holding hearings on TVs first uncensored network. They sample its programming, that play as a series of skits. I can name the good skit movies on one hand, not using my thumb.  Amazon Women on the Moon ,  Kentucky Fried Movie ,  The Meaning of Life , and  Mr. Mikes Mondo Video . Notice how I didnt mention  Tunnel Vision ? The reason for that is that this movie is death in cinematic form. None of the skits are even remotely funny, or even the least bit clever. It takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers part to not even get one laugh out of me. Eye Candy Dody Dorn goes full frontal#0
6568_4#Its curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen. Lucille Ball however was not a major star, that would come with television. As for Dick Powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like Meet The People and his career salvation would be coming in his next film. Dick Powells next film was Murder My Sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals. And Lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do.#0
12219_10#Set in Japan, Ashura is the story of Demons taking over the earth. The premise is far more complicated, but the arching storyline should not be forgotten. Japan is in turmoil, with Demons occupying human form roaming the lands. Generally speaking Demons look and act like humans, but are evil. The Japanese word they use is not just demons, but rather the classical form of ogre which is a mythological creature of some historic stature. Were talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly child-eating monsters. Overall, this film to me is a unique and amazing one, which keeps you riveted and amused. it has good writing, good acting, and good direction. It is all in all a solidly great film.#1
881_1#Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only awful, but really awful. So awful, that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash. It fails so bad, that even the beautiful sceneries in Venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film.#0
12074_1#Ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man (John Carradine) dying and leaving everything to his four children, and his servants to be divided up equally. One condition--they must spend one week in his estate to get the money. And if any of them die, the others get more. Guess what happens next.  Whatever its name is, its a bad movie. To be avoided at all costs.#0
4071_10#I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone. But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one.#1
10664_8#Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film? I LOVE it! One of my Top 10 films of all time. It just makes me feel good. I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over  Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is THE babe of the film, IMHO! I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film. The two are like apples and oranges. The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe its only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen arent changed more than they are. This is a very good film, it is very satisfying. Thats all you need to know!#1
10361_7#Once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended, youll find that its not half bad. The plot is engaging and interesting, and the pacing is fast, with this covering many situations, and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken. Where this really stands out is the acting. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. Its also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film, and even those who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent. The cinematography and editing are nice enough, but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff. This movies story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling. While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture, I understand that it is quite close to the truth. There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this. It is, at times, a downright great courtroom drama. I recommend this to any fellow fan of such. 7/10#1
2308_1#OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting. Then you pop this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes. Supposed to be a comedy. And I must admit I did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending. This movie has the following elements A battered and abused next door neighbor, a boring legal trial, racisim, talk of lynchings, and death and arson. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you never listen to anyones reviews, please do here. You cannot even force yourself to watch this crap. CRAP! I said it, CRAP! Whoever put there name on this should indeed sue.#0
2514_8#I voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws. Other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! Its entertaining to say the least. The shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little bit too much of his  Matrix obsession  into it. It seems like their enemies just stands therewaiting to get shot at. However, this movie is touching and it always makes me cry. It has a lot of GREAT humor in it so it makes me laugh as well. Gackt is a superb actor I must say..he shows so much emotion. This was Hydes first time acting and he did okay. The role fits him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. The whole cast is what I would say, perfect for this movie. DONT MISS IT! YOULL REGRET IT #1
4467_7#Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by.#1
2590_4#American Pie has gone a long distance from the first. At first i believe the actors dont have a clue what their doing and instead its just a remake of a college party gone nuts. Story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie. In fact they didnt once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film. Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free. But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking. Im a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty wouldve been a better choice instead.#0
4087_2#I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film theres really not much to talk of. Just a mish-mash of other FAR better sword & sorcery epics. Lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality. Even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy.Mildly amusing in its ineptitude at best and severely retarded at its worst. Lucio Fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it shows. Eye Candy Sabrina Siani is topless throughout (some may consider that appealing, I did not); various extras are topless as well#0
4424_4#Uh oh! Another gay film. This time its showing the black side. Bet your last dollar its gonna have an unhappy ending! But WHY? With only less than a half dozen exceptions, ALL gay films have to end in death or an  addio  finale. Its like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. The leadmale or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion. Why in Gods name must writers, directors, and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed? After all, its supposed to be gaynot glum. Maybe the category should be changed to a glum film. A large percentage of gay relationships DO last and the couples DO ride off together into the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, for here comes another gay film! This is WRONG #0
7967_4#I might not be a huge admirer of the original  Creepshow , but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection! And to think I was going into this expecting to like this one more. Five years after its predecessor, George Romero gets back on board the EC Comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for Steve Kings three stories. Though, the direction is handed off to Michael Gornick. The film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by Gornick. But most of the blame would have to go to Romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringe-like script (especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story). Moralistic messages (that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters) simply took over the black humour. Oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture. Loosely linking the three tales (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia (80s) animation form. I rather liked this segment and the wisecracking Creep character was a glowing light.  In all, the second short story  The Raft  and the unpleasantly, well-conceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel.#0
1967_4#Darcy and her young daughter Pamela are heading out to the country where her mums boyfriend Peter left his doctors position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn. Although this inn has a terrible past and Pamela learns from one the girls who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house. They called her the Tooth Fairy as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth. This work on the inn, has awoken the Tooth Fairy. Now she has her sights on Pamela and her last baby tooth, but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits Pamela. I thought it was a okay time-waster that has a sound concept, which just isnt fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff. Watchable nonsense, but at the same time extremely forgettable.#0
2402_3#A surprising misfire from the usually reliable Larry Cohen (God Told Me Too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably, even with decent turns by Ed McMahon(!) and Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son Adam simply looks numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic.#0
6224_2#From the Q & A before and after, this is what I could gather Some Irish guy wants to make a movie. Nothing in particular, just any movie. So, one night at a party, he hears some ex-roadie tell him a classic bit of rock n roll lore; the one about how Gram Parsons corpse was stolen from LAX by his loyal roadie so he could honor Parsons wishes that he be cremated out in JoshuaTree. Wow! I should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids, just off the slopes, and into Johnny Knoxville. But if youre a Parsons fan ignore the title, its just a movie for Jackass fans.#0
7477_4#Largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent John Cleese (although he is really sending up his performance in Fawlty Towers). Seems to flip from over the top slapstick to slushy sentimentality at the drop of a hat, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn have to  find themselves , who they are, etc. See it at your peril.#0
7465_1#I could only get through about 25 mins of it. Not one laugh in the 25 minutes I gave it, one of the most painful films Ive ever had to endure. Chris Kattan is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him. Just a horrible movie.#0
8078_2#The world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the Sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart yes, its Solar Crisis, aka Crisis 2050, which burned up a huge chunk of change thats never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a Happy Meal for each of the cast in Japan before going straight to video (remember them?) in a re-edited version credited to one Alan Smithee. The plot hooks pretty much the same as Sunshine - suicide mission to the Sun, saboteur on board, logic cast adrift - except that this time theyre not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach Earth. With a talking bomb. Voiced by Paul Williams. Who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously Given that the cast also includes Jack Palance at his most dementedly OTT, Charlton Heston at his most rigid, top-liner Tim Matheson at his most anonymous, the original Hills Have Eyes unforgettable Michael Berryman (you may not remember the name, but you DO remember that face) and Peter Boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because, er, if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down, youd expect if not a laugh-a-minute at least a laugh every reel. No joy. This is the worst kind of bad movie a boring one. The fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace. Theres low-key and theres walking through it, but here the cast dont even do that. Instead, they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time. You keep on hoping for Paul Williams talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis, but instead the film just stands there, doing next to nothing. Literally. This is one of the most inert movies ever made  so inert that if Clive Owen had been cast, hed almost have looked lively by comparison. Even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves, yep, the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness. Even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis by standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world. Merchant-Ivory films have better action scenes. Things arent much livelier down on Earth where the movie spends most of its running time with Mathesons son/Chucks grandson Corin Nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with Palances insane desert artist  looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me  while waylaid by rejects from a Mad Max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they can release him on a nice beach. Just dont expect logic, if you havent already guessed that much. Best moment? A ditzy girl in a bar describing Jack Palance as  An old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather,  though Chucky Baby taking out the villains aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99% of its running time offers a whole lot of nuttin. Richard C. Sarafians slightly longer original cut that played in Japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes the director of Vanishing Point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re-edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film. A film so bad its not good, and painfully unfunny with it#0
2810_10#This documentary is incredibly thought-provoking, bringing you in to the lives of two long-time lovers who are in the final stages of AIDS. The past footage of their twenty-some-odd years together really brings their final moments home. If this movie doesnt make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people, you dont have a heart.#1
8246_3#Daddys girls Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive some terrific news at the local post office, unaware they are being stalked by burglar Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, father David Miles receives a message (from young Robert Harron) which necessitates daddy leaving home; so, when the young women return, they can be home alone. As the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening, the local  Grand Ball of the Black and Tans  gets underway; and, a dark-skinned drinker portends additional danger for D.W. Griffiths dynamic duo      The Girls and Daddy (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee#0
11438_10#Ralph and Mumford, misfits in their own land, get duped into being unwitting pawns of Synanomess Botch. Twice Upon a Time is the story of them, the characters they meet, and their struggle to set things right. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business, this offbeat movie hits the mark. The animation process, while similar to that of the cut out  South Park  style, is much smoother and far more three-dimensional. If I didnt know that the animation was this style, I would swear that is was traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this film in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE DO! You wont really miss anything if you dont, but if you do, you will get much more out of the experience #1
1673_2#Bad Movie - saw it at the TIFF and the movie gives me a sense of been there done that - it reminds me alot of the movie Blow - expect the Blow was actually interesting. #0
2694_10#Garde à Vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains. If youre not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, dont even try to watch it. Youll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you. Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? Because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation. His wife knows it, shes jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still death penalty)rather than unveiling the sole  pure and innocent  aspect of his pitiful life.#1
12389_10#Bored with the normal, run-of-the-mill staple films to watch this Halloween that Ive seen over and over again, I took a chance on  The Sentinel , hoping it could get my horror juices flowing again. Mind you, I had just come back from seeing the Dark Castle remake of  The House on Haunted Hill  - complete and utter crap. Thankfully,  The Sentinel  BLEW ME AWAY! In a riviting story about a model who moves into a creepy building in Brooklyn Hights, the film offered everything that I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Campy and fantasically juicy characters, exchanges and dialogue, including hilaraious turns by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and especially, Martin Balsam, as an absent minded professor - (2) Horrifying Terror! Not to give a frame away, but there are scenes in this film that chilled me to my pancreas - (3) Fantastic gore, terrific make-up and wacky (if very uneven) direction from Michael Winner, which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat. If you loved  Evil Dead 2 ,  Dead Alive  and  Deep Rising  - this will be your queen of favourites. Just to emphasize my love for this film - after I watched it for the first time, jaw-dropped, I rewound it and watched it again. It is now one of favourites of all time. Do yourself a favour and check it out #1
10317_7#You know how Star Trek fans flocked to all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones? Why? To see their heroes in action one more time. Thats the way I feel about Doc Savage. I am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation. Then they decided to crib elements from a number of Doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. Theres a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the  camp  elements, etc.) But the spirit of Doc is there, and thats what those of us familiar with Doc and his crew respond to. So, in my long-winded way, what Im trying to say is that this is not a bad movie its just not as good as it should have been. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.#1
3826_10#I love Korean films because they have the ability to really (quiet eerily really) capture real life. I tend to watch Korean movies just for that reason alone. Ive seen this directors other movies before. The one that comes closest to the feelings I got from this is Oasis and another awesome film called This Charming Girl. I dont believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that. There in lies the reason why it worked even more. Its real, its honest. And because of that, it is by far the best summation of a real Christian life I have seen on film.#1
7805_1#An actors first film is usually something one can afford to miss - its often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display, and this film is no exception. Luckily, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films. Careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one.#0
11391_8#An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. Watch as Gene sings, acts and dances his way through Paris in any number of situations. Some purely majestic, others pure corn. One can imagine just what Kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before  Singin In The Rain . He is definately one of the all time greats. It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in Kellys characters, the only main difference being that one is based in Paris, the other in L.A. 8/10 stars.#1
11714_1#The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub! This has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of  real  UK police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery. Avoid it like the veritable plague.#0
1643_10#This is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting. Mr. Torn and Ms Farrel do an outstanding job. I think they should have it on TV again so a new audience can enjoy it. Wonderful performances. It was done when Ms. Farrel was very young. I had always thought of her as a comedian, but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful. There is very little dialogs, but that just make it seem more real. Mr. Torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling. I must see movie.#1
12080_3#Im a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I waited anxiously to see this episode. Ill comment on the movie first, then the MST3K episode. The recipe for this movie take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material, and a $1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain of all life and movement, until dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a big, plain stone cauldron. Movie, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit. Okay, now the MST3K episode. Ill admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway through. I understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well. However, when I watched it a second time, I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines I missed the first time around. The trick with this episode is listen carefully! It takes a couple of viewings to catch each line. Give it a second chance, and Youll see what I mean. MST3K Episode 7 1/2 out of 10.#0
7671_1#The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. It gives the basic summary of what is going on. This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but know people who have. From my understanding whether youve played the game or not this movie does not get any better. Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.#0
5491_10#Even though we know how the story ends, this is a gripping fly-on-the-wall film that plays almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm, we meet Hugo Chavez as a charismatic, larger than life man who has an unbreakable connection with the mestizos who make up 80% of the population but have previously been shut out of Venezuelas political process and its oil wealth. He seems as devoted to them as they are to him. He travels the country at a hectic pace, reaching out to the campesinos, addressing huge crowds, hugging and kissing ordinary people, accepting letters on scraps of paper, and hearing pleas for help. The people are excited that one of their number has made it to the highest office in the land. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to the festering barrios. This is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The skill of the filmmakers is in being unobtrusive and letting the story unfold through the voices of Venezuelans at every level from the barrio to the presidential palace, the tumultuous scenes, the chaos and confusion out of which a coherent whole emerges that is tense, riveting and moving. Not to be missed #1
4531_4# A death at a college campus appears to be a suicide but is actually a cover for murder. The dead mans roommate finds himself embroiled in a mystery as he tries to uncover the truth behind the young mans murder. Twists and turns, as well as some false leads, makes this a tough case for our collegiate hero to solve, let alone (keep) out of the clutches of the killer,  according to the DVD sleeves synopsis.      A Shot in the Dark (2/1/35) Charles Lamont ~ Charles Starrett, Robert Warwick, James Bush#0
4102_10#I like this movie much, its special type of humor by Ondricek and Machacek I think its better then Samotari (Loners).. Maybe its difficult to understand when you are not Czech. If you are not watching that movie, just enjoy it, dont mind about anything else.. just relax  #1
4138_10#Another reason to watch this delightful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance. As they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. From 1939, its a different time but therein lies the charm. It transports you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely delightful, at the same time strong, vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman.Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I am going to seek out the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of the Flynn/Gable mode and proves a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some excellent comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30s/40s movies, Dont miss this one!#1
10922_10#When I was very young,on a local tv station,they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays.I saw lots of Kung Fu movies on weekends.I remember lots of them.I saw great flicks like Crippled Masters,Blind Fist of Bruce,Kung Fu Zombie,Shaolin Drunken Monk,Rage of the Master,Tattoe Dragon,andFive Deadly Venoms.I remember the day clearly.Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King.We were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday.We ran in the house and jumped onto the couch,turned on the set and flicked it onto 56.The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it.Then under that was the Title of the film.It said Five Deadly Venoms.Then the movie began.I bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence.I loved this movie the minute it came on.My favorite character was the Toad Venom.The plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasnt what lured meit was the fighting.The fights were soamazing.I moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended.#1
4925_7#A neat race against time premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victims infected cousin is holding out on them.   Community? What community? Dyou think youre living in the Middle Ages?  #1
8359_8#Bertrand Blier is indeed lenfant terrible of French cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public. Filmed with his fave duo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and the usual dose of sex (Miou-Miou plays her typical role, at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best French actress ever). In first  Les Valseuses  is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals. Those who only are satisfied with family life, or simply know nothing more, the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that, it just let you think of all the usual things in life (working for the car, being bounded at work etc.). Its a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society were living in. Great job and it just makes you wish two things  Dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course Depardieu, hed better should have stuck with French movies as he proves here that no one can beat him. Timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some#1
9217_7#This truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters, just about every voluptuous middle-aged female in Hollywood, and a touching, funny love story. The Capomezzas and the Malacicis are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also at opposite--extreme--ends of the taste scale. Their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of Romeo and Juliet. Naturally, they fall in love. On stage! The mayhem and confusion that this causes, as the parents feud with each other and their kids, is played out for us against the backdrop of the Capomezzas magnificently tasteless home, and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings. If you are sensitive about Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all of the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love it #1
4313_9#Grand Canyon falls under a very scarce category it is a very clever film, with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end. I have the impression that it never made it to its deserved ranking (and never will), because of its simplicity. This kind of flick needs sensitive watchers. Pity thought that IMDb makes me write ten lines, because this is in no way necessary in this particular case. Anyway in order to fulfill this request, I will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting not that it is bad but it could have been done much better. Exception made for Kevin Kline who was perfect. Go ahead and watch it.#1
1528_1#Well, not yet, at least. This is truly a bad movie. (And I liked Ishtar!) ;)#0
3457_7#This is the Columbo that got directed by Steven Spielberg at an early point in his career. Its nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for Spielberg can be seen in this movie. The movie is basically in the same style as most of Spierlbergs 70s movies and TV works. So that means that some characters tend to show some quirkinesss and no Im not just talking about the Columbo character alone. The kind of character quirkiness which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 Spielberg movie  Jaws . But other than some small hints of typical early Spielberg elements, you cant call this movie the work of- and fine example of a rising director star. Not that its bad, of course it isnt but as I said earlier, it also isnt anything too sensational. 7/10#1
11403_3#i love horror films, low budget, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s.. but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film? lets compare it to titles in a similar vein- haunted house films. the haunting, the changeling, the shining. or for a similar technology based horror film that was FAAAR better, (though still FAR from great) Demon Seed. OK, ill be fair.. lets compare it to made-for-TV horror films! dont go to sleep.. waaay creepier and better done. salems lot, the night stalker, night gallery, even dont go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better.  SPOILERS  first of all, for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was, you have a scene like the opening scene.. oh boy! the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers! TERRIBLE. also, just what we understand about the house.. it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on, and its a very emotional house. not a spirit, or demon, or entity, its a house thats  possessed , but by what? we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie/margaret, our protagonist? now that Im on the topic of suzie.. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor old crazy lady comes, tells you she was your nurse, pours her heart out, falls in the boiling pool, struggling in agony for 45 seconds, and what does margaret do? does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn hers life? no, she stands there and watches! the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film, but thats where the positives end. for at least a more interesting, and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats. i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either havent watched it since it originally aired, or remembered it scaring them as children. this film was pretty much merit less.#0
5088_8#I never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. I always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90s. But after I saw on the internet that this was meant for the TV, I was shocked because for a television film, it is absolutely fantastic! I was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also, the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. Still, its a great film for the television. 8 out of 10.#1
3401_8#The pioneering Technicolor Cinematography (Winner of Special Technical Achievement Oscar) is indeed enchanting. Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and youve got a rather pleasant  picture . Unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired. Still, there have not been any more breathtaking Technicolor films before this one (1936), and very few since then, that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. Cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in  Robin Hood  (1938),  Jesse James  (1939) and  Gone With The Wind  (1939), will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here.  The Garden Of Allah  will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.#1
3851_10#Paul Verhoeven has one of the strangest oeuvres of any major director he started off making art-house films in his native Netherlands before moving to Hollywood where he began making subversive genre pieces which are often seen as mere entertainments by the mainstream crowd. 1983s The Fourth Man was the last film he made before moving to the U.S. and it seems to have been a transitional film for him. The Fourth Man is a horror film which manages to bring the viewer into the mind of the protagonist while still maintaining a certain ambiguity it certainly seems as if Gerard is in danger but it may just be more of his  lying the truth.  The film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism which helps make it a unique and satisfying cinematic experience.#1
10046_1#I wasnt terribly impressed with Dantes 1st season offering in  Homecoming , it wasnt much of a horror story, but rather a smart political statement with the undead. Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes mens sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women. The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists. Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home. I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak, but is unclear because this is never revisited. The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah.It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.#0
4356_8# The Thing About my Folks  came in as a surprise. We had no idea about what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta, and based on a screen play by one of its stars, Paul Reiser, proved to be a pleasant time at the movies. Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome, this is a voyage of discovery where Ben gets to know his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is, and not the mythical figure he has in his mind. Although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience, it should please anyone.#1
4675_4# Washington Square  is a flat, shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James masterpieces. Moreover its simple, eventless story seems unsuited to make it into a film (although William Wyler, with his  The Heiress , gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel).  The acting is adequate to the movie poor and flat, in spite of the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith.  Washington Square  is definitely a non-recommendable film.#0
1053_4#Bizarre take on the Cinderella tale. Terribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner turns in a pretty decent evil step-mother performance. If youre really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest  Ever After A Cinderella Story  or  The Glass Slipper .#0
1654_7#Soap Opera about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his  manager  tricking her into believing she has all it takes but  experience  to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actors unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected a life prison sentence for hubby. Next thing you know shes joined a traveling Burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her mans freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk! This film has a pretty interesting plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all  greatly  enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by Kay Francis - she just makes this film. Also helping here is the well-done acting by Minna Gombell in her role as a  getting close to forty  older lady who works the burlesque and befriends Kay. Worth seeing, especially for Kay Francis fans.#1
8610_2#As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield, this was a terrible movie. The plot was kind of a holistic rip off of various movies, but unfortunately they forgot to rip off any good jokes. In addition it was annoying and boring and thats being kind. If youre looking for a good laugh, rent a copy of Private Parts.#0
3864_4#Just a regular Jason lee movie, There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was an all right movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am glad that I didnt see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But I guess thats why I didnt see it in the theater.#0
2584_7#The film starts out very slowly, with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm, an attendant at a photo-service drop-off station. His wife has been restricted to her home with an ankle bracelet as the result of a sentence for arson. Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department, and takes firefighting seriously. The film is entertaining, but not laugh-out-loud funny. I think enough of it to have a copy in my library. Its a good offbeat film.#1
1868_10#This movie describes the life of somebody who grew up in the worst of circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a respectable person. Whats more is that this is a true story. There is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent. The only rating I can give it is a 10/10.#1
11567_8#In the 1930s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors, given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films, so its interesting that this one should star Shirley Temple, who had long since established herself as The Most Famous Child Star of All Time. Then again, she probably wasnt the one being tested, I would imagine that would have been Frank Coghlan Jr., who played Shirleys brother Sonny in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance. Then again, a 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy act to accompany. Its a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to, but its cute enough and enjoyable enough (and short enough, as it were) to still be a fun movie. We already dont expect an epic plot in a 19-minute film, but Pardon My Pups still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time. And it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I am hardly an expert of Shirley Temples films, but its not hard to see how she became The Most Famous Child Star of All Time.#1
9268_3#   SPOILERS    Like some evil Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance double-play combination we have in  Omen IV  the evil seed of the deceased AntiChrist Damien Thorn come back. Terrorizing his parents his schoolmates his neighbors and finally the entire world as a she named Delia York, Asia Vieila. After being given to a  deserving  couple the Yorks Karen & Gene, Fay Grant & Michael Woods,by the Catholic Churchs St. Francis orphanage. Having a private eye Earl Knight, Mchael Learner,and later a former Catholic nun sister Yvonne,Megan Lehch,and now faith healer Felichy in the film only to be killed off didnt help the plot either. It only prolonged the suffering of those of us watching the movie. You could see the surprise ending coming almost as soon as the film  Omen IV  began with the bases being cleared for Delias eventual takeover of the civilized as well as uncivilized world. What was a bit of a surprise was Delia doing it with a little help from friends.#0
5884_10#Really, I liked it. The premise was good, the story fit where both respective series left off, and heres my favorite part. Mary and Valerie arent bitter! They arent like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey,  The Partridge Family ). In fact, Valerie was saying that shed be thrilled to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would be on the look for anotherbut if that doesnt quite work out, then they can re-run this one.#1
1178_10#This might be the WWEs 2nd best PPV of the year after Wrestlemania it was a good suprise! John Cena had an excellent match in which he upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his IC title in a short sloppy match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a fairly violent tables match over Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a really good match with Kidman which was suprising to me. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a no dq match, at one point Booker T gave the scissors kick to Big Show and sent him right through the table. In a stupid decision by the WWE Christian and Lance Storm, the jealous anti-americans defeated Hogan and Edge with a lot of help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had the match of the night it was filled with great high spots and RVD got to retain his ic title through a DQ so I was happy he kept the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw which means little to nothing. And in the main event the Rock became the first ever 7-time WWE world champion defeating both Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple threat match. Overall this is probably the WWEs 2nd best PPV of 2002! 7/10#1
6553_10#Its a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning, a middle, and a end, a nice, clever mystery, with an appealing heroine for all ages, who wins us over with her wit and charm. Andrew Flemings film is indeed a modern marvel, a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in Hollywood. He puts away the over-reliance on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film, with a very capable young actress, and a talented supporting cast. While taking a vacation to California, our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a Hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play; suddenly she is  visited  by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself. What makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details, as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the California scene, and this is well presented, without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual. Eventually, the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences, from the young ones to the adults in the audience. It is a movie that deserves to be seen, appreciated, and enjoyed, a film that is rare and delicate, and its not afraid to be classified as fun! Five Stars#1
1996_3#This sad little film bears little similarity to the 1971 Broadway revival that was such a nostalgic hit. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival, he rewrote the book extensively. I have a feeling that this screenwriter wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well. I played the innocent philanderer Jimmy Smith on-stage in 1974, and thought this $1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the anticipated delight of seeing  Topper  Roland Young play my part was a major disappointment. Three songs from the play remain, and are done very poorly. Even the classic duet,  Tea For Two , is done as a virtual solo. The many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all, and the star, Anna Neagle, just embarrasses herself. When I feel gypped by spending a dollar, I know the film must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called  Tea For Two  and is about doing the stage play (the original, of course), so those who are seeking the true  No No Nanette  might find a more recognizable version there.#0
11683_3#Three story lines and not enough tying them together,  Inside Man  was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though having its moments, the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl, jumped quickly between highs and lows, and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical  super-detective  with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as  evil genius  and  criminal mastermind  (both not the same in retrospect). Overall though, each person individually created a great sub-section. Yet, when the parts finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden  ah-ha!  or summation of everything. It all ended up with very little of the energy it began with, with a lot of plot-holes, tons of questions, and as I said earlier, no where near Spike Lees normal level. I have to completely disagree with the so-called  professional critics  this is not the movie they play it up to be.#0
5759_10#I collect Horror films from all over and I have seen the good and the very bad - Zombie Bloodbath is a low budget video. Sure, the acting is bad, the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots. The thing you seem to be missing is that its still entertaining and really very fun. The effects range from, like someone on here has said, pasty-faced zombies that look like KISS rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work. But the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area. The effects are very good for such a small film. Someone called it a Party movie and it is. 100% fun party movie. I have heard from various websites that this is actually a  rough cut  of the film that got general release but the actual  directors cut  is coming on DVD and it is very nice quality. I will buy it and judge for myself. PS - I heard they are now remaking this on a big budget???#1
4353_4#The Class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27-year-old former class mates. What bothers me with the series is that the only Latino character Aaron is being picked on for his accent (even though by a non-respectable character, but anyway).#0
8562_4#CAMILLE 2000  A sexed-up love story for the swinging Sixties, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas La Dame aux Camelias) by screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger who, along with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of Adult cinema throughout the 1960s and 70s. Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzgers exploration of la dolce vita is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), though the films sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards. Production values are handsome throughout, and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite weak post-sync dubbing. Though set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatinis wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period, and Piero Piccionis wah-wah music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this directors elegant softcore erotica wont be disappointed. Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.#0
5182_8#A quiet, sweet and beutifully nostalgic movie on how it is to be confronted with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all that memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you. A movie that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here old jelousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Mischief, nightly fridge-raids and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp-leader now is retiring and want to meet the children from the golden years of the camp. All of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers.#1
3572_1#The wonderful  Z  Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after  Butterfly . I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously WORSE in this film. I just hope they burn this film for ya if you do.#0
651_4#I saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts. I must admit, I found it pretty decentuntil I started to THINK about what the characters were saying. Logical problems This movie might be good for teenagers, or young couples just looking for a fun night out. If you dont consider all the goofs, its a mediocre film.#0
8179_7#This would have been so much fun to see in a theater, back in 1996. There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental-phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.#1
5969_3#   SPOILER    Do not read this, if you think about watching that movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way The plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway) Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).#0
3444_10#I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it. I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats. Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes, but because it was a real film. No Hollywood BS, no explosions, no corny one liners; film. It drew you in slowly, reeling you toward a tragically human fate. Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken. They like movies; mindless entertainment for entertainments sake alone. Michael Bays Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience. No need to think people, just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain. Well even place advertisements throughout the movie, to keep you buying our products. And dont forget the explosions, we all love explosions. Here we make the distinction, art can be entertaining, but its also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways. Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily. Movie are entertainment. Descent is a film. Film is art. Treat yourself. Challenge yourself. Watch this film.#1
10062_10#Wow. What a wonderful film. The script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by Minglun Wei,I hope he has more stories in him. If only more movies like this were made whether in Hollywood or Hong Kong- a family friendly, well acted, well written, well directed, near perfect gem.#1
2575_7#I rented this film from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for what I thought would be a silly 50s sci-fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length Superman film. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised. The film is a little unevenly paced. Although the Molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. By todays standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this films special effects and costuming were quite good. The cinematography is also generally very good, and the acting is much better than one might expect. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.#1
1918_9#Ill be honest with yall, I was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on ABC I didnt think I would like it at all. But with John Ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it, plus their was something else with it I liked. The acting was great, not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines, John Ritter always brings his A game when it comes to comedy . This was a great show to watch, and Ill tell you why it was a great show. My father who never watches sitcoms at all, he just watches movies, sports, and law & order, he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother, and myself, and watched the show I think because John Ritter was in it. I honestly think this show would still be running if John Ritter God rest his soul i wish he hadnt passed away.#1
6455_7#I was drawn to this movie the moment I saw a preview of it on Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked. We Americans are suckers for a comeback kid. Rugged individualism has its place but it is over-rated.#1
70_2#This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one. I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for eye candy purposes. It wont satisfy even that.#0
2213_9#Wow this was a movie was completely captivating I could not believe that I started awake so late to watch it but it came on late ounce I started watching I couldnt stop it had a full range of very good cast members wow even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many more well known actors and actresses this was more than a glimpse into history it was eye opening into another part of society that people dont know of and may even be embarrassed to talk about . Ive never heard of a book or movie about this before and this is something that black history never addresses only looks down on because they were privleged and mixed race , I highly recommend this movie#1
1634_4#BEGIN SPOILER Fitfully funny and memorable for Mr. Chongs literal roach-smoking scene Chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipes bowl, lights up, coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity,then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat, re-loads the bowl properly, re-lights, re-tokes. END SPOILER. Alas, I began to lose faith less than half-way through the proceedings. It occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable. I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners, Harold and Kumar. I simply prefer brighter company. Yet, the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble-minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they-- the former are sober. Notable guest appearance by Paul Reubens spouting obscenities in pre-Pee-wee form.#0
970_1#normally im not the sort to be scared by horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some how this movie got into my mind  it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective, it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments, the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout. Another seen was the family photo i wasnt expecting that and i jumped out my seat  i would recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time #0
73_1#This has to be the worst piece of garbage Ive seen in a while. I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasnt free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.#0
2017_1#The plot is plausible but banal, i.e., beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk, then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her. But, what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical. Despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic, their attorney and local police (who say they can do nothing) at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror. They have no private security staff (only a fancy security system that they mishandle), household or grounds staff, chauffeurs, etc. Not even, apparently, the funds to hire private round-the-clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life-threatening injuries, leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner. The production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). And, shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering.#0
3158_8#There are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set. That 70s Show is a great example. When the show came on the air, nobody really heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests) I wish Topher would stay around because the show began about his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland from Eight Is Enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney who played Dons girlfriend Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the replacement could not match her and I am sorry about that. I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to Steven Hyde. I loved watching Tanya Roberts besides Charlies Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackies mom. She really showed her acting talent before heading to Broadway. This show has been a delight with many surprises. I hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but I hope they dont stay too far away too long. I wish the shows creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show, Third Rock from The Sun, is more successful on Fox than they were on NBC which sabotaged their show. The Turners are not dummies and I hope they create more shows like this in the future.#1
7616_1#The good news is a movie was made, drawing on a supposed Aztec myth and featuring an unusually Aztec-American (is such a word exists) cast. The bad news is, it was dead at birth. I paid $3.45 to rent this. I could have better spent it on a hamburger!#0
4738_4#I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. The pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!). I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. Even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam  Azumis rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still does an okay job. She looks great in the capebut where did she get it from? I dont think i will be watching this one over and over again! what a pity.#0
2832_4#Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was  the only film (he) did purely for the money  as well as  the worst film he ever starred in . Hold on, Michael, werent you in The Swarm and Hurry Sundown? And werent both of those films a good deal worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures (the director, Richard Fleischer, was hospitalised as a result of sun-stroke during the shoot). What Ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low-point of Michael Caine. Instead, it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline. Along the way, big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. William Holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot; Omar Sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists Caine in his quest. The film is based on a best-seller entitled Ebano, by the little-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. Ustinov is charismatic as the slaver (he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances), and Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks hell never see his wife again. There are occasional flashes of action, but on the whole Ashanti is quite slow-moving. All in all, it is a resistible piece of action hokum - not by any stretch as awful as Caine has frequently suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let-down from all the talent involved.#0
1869_9#Antwone Fishers story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children. Abandoned by a troubled mother, Antwone has never met his father. Growing up with  church going  abusers who use the  n-word  not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment, as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold-up, enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the Navy, Antwones anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a Navy psychiatrist, and a love enters his life. As a Clevelander I appreciated the location footage. No matter where you are from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem.#1
5066_1#This is the worst show. Buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing. Even Sesame Street has better humor and more adult than friends  Friends  may be the worst thing Ive ever seen on television and Ive been sitting in front of the tube observing Friends  simply does not stack up well to other, contemporary series. It lacks the smartness of  Seinfeld  and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of  Frasier . The characters in  Friends  seem designed to make them repellant dullards. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl. The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so. (It might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of  Friends .)#0
10566_3#While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series.#0
2653_10#Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen Kings book titled the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasnt good and didnt want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but dont know when and how. Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later on, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are  intruders  in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things Ive ever seen happen here. The ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute.#1
8569_9#This is just as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more of her this time round. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the rather bumbling male lead. To use Paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea. The movie is well worth watching whatever your age, provided you like animals.#1
5173_3#When I saw this at a shop I thought it looked really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek meets Texas chainsaw massacre, and I mean it only cost three quid (around $6). To be honest I dont think it was even worth that. Overall a pointless watch. It felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes. If you want an artsy film-dont bother. If you want a slasher movie- dont bother- The film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening.#0
7473_4#My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong willed Southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD. The first season was must-see TV for us. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching. My husband and I were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up. But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss. Why would a strong, middle aged woman do those things? The answer is she wouldnt. Additionally, my husband and I pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family. Cant the script writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers. We prefer shows that dont betray the characters and insult our intelligence.#0
5467_2#What to say about this movie. Well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people. Two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the schools basement. That is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever. Though that is not fair, some people like Tromas movies and they can watch it if they want. Troma movies for me though, are the worst movies there are out there. I just watched this one out of morbid curiosity.#0
9034_10#This film was absolutely BRILLIANT  Every performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It looks like Mr Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE film career if this is anything to go by. I thought that Joe Johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters(Jumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids). He pulls of every scene with sheer class. My favourite scene was where Homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all of his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting driven films as well as his Big budget blockbuster faire, which is also excellent. KUDOS  to all involved in this masterpiece!#1
7645_4#Dumb is as dumb does, in this thoroughly uninteresting, supposed black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an uninspired version of  The Three Amigos , only without any laughs. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which  Play Dead  is not. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which  Play Dead  is. What  Play Dead  really is, is a town full of nut jobs. Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thorntons character from  A Simple Plan , while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK#0
1825_2#Im not sure what. I just couldnt laugh at it. I had an open mind. I didnt want to be a tight-@ss about it. But I seriously just couldnt laugh at this film. It was just not funny to me. Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you put two very funny men together doesnt mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy. Some movies just shouldnt be made. This is one of them. Because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know its a comedy. Sort of at least. But I was just not impressed. Im sorry, but I cannot give this anything lower than a two. And thats all Im giving.  2/10#0
131_10#This is the fifth von Trier film I have seen. I believe that he is the only director to whom I have given such a high score on all his movies. Four of them, The Element of Crime, Europa, Breaking the Waves, and Dancer in the Dark, I have given a 10, and one, The Idiots, I have given a 9 (and I have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since I first saw it, although Id like to see it once more before I do). He has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors. I tend to agree with him. I cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films. In 50 years, when von Trier retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time. It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this. So the key to interpreting Europa, almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime, is that we are deep in our/von Triers subconscious, and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone. What does the train itself symbolize? Consider it internally, and only then discuss it externally. Europa is a great film, a masterpiece. I was never bored by it, even though I watched it at 3 am. The perfect time to watch, actually, since it works in dream logic.#1
3635_3#Some good movies keep you in front of the TV, and you are dying to see the result. #0
11578_1#Perhaps the biggest waste of production time, money and the space on the video store shelf. If someone suggests you see this movie, run screaming in the other direction. Unless, of course, youre into self-abuse.#0
7730_7#If in the 90s youre adapting a book written in the 50s, set the bloody thing in the 50s and not the 90s. See, 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well, or ring as true, that far down the road. Its a simple rule that Hollywood habitually keeps violating. And thats the problem with this film. It should have been set in the era it was written in. Youd think that would be a no-brainer, but nooo. Id elaborate, but bmacvs comment spells it out quite well. Ill limit my commentary to Rachel Ward. She looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role. As a result, she looks like a crack ho on chemotherapy, and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag. I found her  I could die at any moment  look quite disconcerting, and it greatly detracted from her supposed  hotness  and the  sexual tension  the film intended to create. Other than that, the film was quite good; a 7+ out of 10.#1
12068_9#If you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue, and any sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film. It probably was originally a play, and thats why its dialogue heavy, but I cant stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters. #1
11050_8#Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This movie about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense. Even if it had something of a theater-play (almost everything happens in the cell) it never got boring and it was acted very well. In the tradition of  Cube  you felt trapped with the Characters and even if they were criminal, you developed some sympathy with some of them, only to change your mind by the twists the story takes. Some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air. Altogether intense and entertaining and as I didnt expect anything (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise #1
11114_1#I was never so bored in my life. Hours of pretentious, self-obsessed heroin-addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems. Its like watching lizards molt. Even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy. If you have insomnia, rent this.#0
11830_9#This is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork. The only negatives I found were Pacinos voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonnas off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those  faults  are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie.a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion..like nothing you have ever seen.#1
9005_8#This was one of those times when I had nothing to do with 27 premium movie channels available to me. The Theory of Flight grabbed me and held my interest. I found it both touching and amusing, a nice combination of feelings. I recommend it!#1
8107_3#This film is quite boring. There are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they dont succeed. Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. The incongruities in bouncing between domestic household/marriage issues and political crises are badly matched. Character attitudes change without explanation throughout. Badly disjointed.#0
6786_1#In the questionable comedy vein of Mel Brooks,  Wholly Moses!  tries to take the Bible story of Moses and make fun of it, resulting in the unfunniest Biblical spoof ever filmed. This is rated (PG) for some physical violence, profanity, sexual references, and adult situations.#0
5219_3# Metamorphosis  hold a tiny bit of cult-value, simply because it was written and directed by George Eastman. This Italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid Joe DAmato production during the late 70s/early 80s. Wouldnt it be interesting for avid Euro-cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare-butted in  Erotic Nights of the Living Dead  all the time? I thought so! Now, unlike the movies he starred in, Eastmans own  Metamorphosis  is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments. There are a handful of nasty murders, cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies (a guest appearance by sleaze-queen Laura Gemser!) on display, but its mainly a talkative movie. The handsome & eloquent Dr. Houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human DNA codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. He developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process, but if he doesnt come up with detailed reports any time soon, his research will be stopped. So Dr. Houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. Needless to say (and like the title implies), he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! In other words, his research sucked! Like the other reviewers already mentioned, this movie  borrows  a lot of ideas from David Cronenbergs  The Fly   the dramatic romance sub plot included - but doesnt add any originality from its own. The big difference is that you constantly feel connected with Jeff Goldblums character in  The Fly , whereas Dr. Houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible. The rapid-ageing-syndrome aspect also reminded me of Ruggero Deodatos sadly underrated giallo  Phantom of Death , only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didnt inflict it on himself. The physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films, though. Few scares or excitement to discover here, instead the movie features loads of bad acting, poor lighting, lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot. Feel free to skip this one.#0
4077_1#What do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are excruciatingly long, terrible lighting, painful editing, and awful effects? You get Jessica A Ghost Story Seems its shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this medium. In this case it does not. There are a few CUs where the persons face is entirely in shadow. One scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists. Its a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half but I guess then they wouldnt have a film at feature length. The main character is incredibly flat. Hes the LEAD male, so he should have some  hero  elements to his character, but he does not. He whines and is scared the entire film. I could go on, but I dont want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they did have nice camera movement. Too bad the lighting didnt compliment it. The cover of the DVD is nice, and thats where it ends. Just terrible.#0
1902_10#Lets begin with that theme song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is  If you get caught between the moon and New York City.  Its a great theme and song even after all these years, it never gets tiring. It really is a great song about New York City as well. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore CBE stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to Jill Eikenberrys character in the film. Jill would later star on LA Law. Anyway, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM who won an Academy Award for his performance in the film as Best Supporting Actor. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnellis character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her Oscar winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza doesnt get to sing. She plays a diner waitress. Anyway I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the Bach matriarch of the family who decides the familys fortune. Anyway, she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for Best Supporting Actress. Barney Martin best known as Jerrys dad on Seinfeld plays Lizas dad. Hes great too. The movie was well-written, acted, and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.#1
9583_4# Proximity  tells of a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him. This very ordinary film is an action/drama with a weak plot; stereotypical, poorly developed characters; and a one dimensional performance by Lowe. A forgettable film not worthy of further commentary.#0
4168_4#Well, this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more adult oriented humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-Disney Channel type mode, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really fake Italian accent. The movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget. There was one very cute moment which Ill just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner. The laughs are very few and far between. The end surprise for  Mr. Fix It  is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else. Might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or TV but dont waste your money buying or renting this movie.#0
8230_4#Im dumbfounded. Yes thats right. Im really caught here. No way did I find it awful, but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency. The idea behind such a trim, minimal low-budget Indie production isnt bad, but its a confused muddle and in the end didnt do anything for me. Its amateurish and simple; it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of-late fashionably rapid filming style. We have the documentary laced (hand-held) camera moving everywhere (despite never leaving the van), and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out. Lately you kind of get use to it, but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating. Keeping it still will help. The context has little groundwork (which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads. At a road-side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied SUV headlight. Scared, they flee and not too long that one-light SUV appears behind them. Soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror) spending most of the time playing out a drawn out, noisy and relentless cat and mouse game.  The performances; Jennifer Barnett, Angela Brunda, Danielle Lilley, Sandra Paduch and Mia Yi are workman-like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the scripts weaknesses in its character-foundation . Veronica Garcias flipped-out, bug-eyed intensity as the loony driver of the SUV was something yeah something. Her characters real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non-existent. I guess being psychotic was good enough. Now probably the most unnerving thing I came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack. Terrible techno music, to cheesy hard-rock and an overwrought closing score. It never felt overdone or got in the way, but it did stick out like a sore thumb. Co-directors Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources, but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle. Maybe it was enjoyable to make, but watching it just wasnt the case.#0
8133_1#The movie is just as fun as staring at the sun.Sheriff Pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking up all that so called  Blood  which in reality seemed like Fruit Punch. Most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie.The rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time, the ending was awful, the outlines were cheesy, and the scenes were terrible. What else more should I say to you viewers out there? My advice would be to get your Rabies shot if youve already watched the movie. This movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you didnt get your up-to-date shots.#0
12472_10#The little girl Desi is so adorable I cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here. It will make you cry, laugh, and believe. Knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there. Great cast and an overall great movie.#1
11341_4#In a way this is the disaster Fellini has been working towards all his life. The line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small, and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings. That said,  Casanova  left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by Bukowski  Yet, there might just be a point in portraying Casanova as an unsightly fool. And I challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini couldnt. More than ever he seems here like a dirty old man - a maestro, for sure, but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else. I find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film. It was a story not worth telling.#0
11939_4#Let me tell you something about this movie. I have seen it twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me. I really liked it. I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool. That is it. I am giving the movie the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I hadnt have fun with it as a kid.#0
9498_8# Painting is seeing, then remembering better than you saw.  So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter in The Light That Failed.The movie is in the grand old Hollywood style, starring Ronald Colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes Ida Lupino in her first important role, dependable character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned.),and a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston. Well acted and well directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.#1
877_8#Jean-Jacques career began with his essay answer to a prize question civilization makes us evil. This intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. In that sense it repeats a theme common to French films society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery may well hold true in France; at any rate, its quite romantic.#1
143_7#Riget II is a good sequel, but not quite as good as the first one. This series dont seem to be quite as serious as the first one. There are much more comedy in this, good one, though. All together this makes a good sequel. If youd seen Riget you can see this one without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These two makes up a series you dont wanna miss.#1
2038_7#This film exceeded my expectations. I thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish, so i wasnt expecting much. However, i was pleasantly surprised. At first i didnt take well to the lead girl and didnt really care if she lived or died. After a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character. Its not just some slasher film where people die for no reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film, but explains a lot. I would recommend this film to everyone. If youre not sure just watch it anyway, its only an hour and a half of your life. Youre going to live for 80 years anyway.#1
10442_10#This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that Ive ever seen. Closely followed by none other than  Before Sunset , which technically isnt another movie at all, since its about the same two people and the same romance. Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. Wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations. Young love, at its best.#1
7987_2#Im sure this was one of those  WOAH!  attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now its just silly. The films message is cliché. The Circle-Vision is disorienting. And that awful song at the end is grating. And I really wish theyd install seats. After so much walking, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear theres a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! You get entertained while sitting down, right? WRONG! Youre standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. Disney should make a newer Maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull, lackluster film. NOT FUN. Skip it. In fact, skip Canada altogether unless youre eating there. Move directly to the United Kingdom.#0
3078_1#I didnt think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts.really awful. The fact that it doesnt take itself seriously (usually a good thing) works against it, primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards. On the upshot though..the MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs.#0
5658_4# Laugh, Clown Laugh  released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. That kind of  ick  factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonettas affections with a young and handsome Count Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is being (until he reveals it himself at the end). The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career. While I adore Chaneys brilliance as an actor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy.#0
1918_3#TV version of  Twister  springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable. My sister bought this at a Wal-Mart a few years back when it was released, I saw it back then and thought it was okay. Later  Twister  with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt comes out (or was it before? I think it was 97) and did a better job overall. But  Twister  was more silly fun; this is realistic with a message. It all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters Twisters, or a low-budget character study? - John Ulmer#0
5415_1#Dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The movie followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti all of whom were superb. In short, the movie is worth a miss.#0
5471_8#During 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that Lily Powers,(Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to obtain great wealth and power. Lilys father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on Lily. As the story progresses, Lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president It is great to see a very young John Wayne, (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to first base with Lily, not even for lunch. A very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) stars along with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances. This is a great film from 1933 which was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen. This film is rather mild compared to what we view on the Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film. Enjoy#1
3994_4#I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. Im slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of his work. Wait for it to come on cable. I wouldnt have minded paying for it as a matinée, but Im feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it.#0
5966_7#Actually, I never bought into the metal was satanic and stuff, but this movie kind of played on that idea. Though certainly not a movie to take seriously or to rate really high, it does serve its purpose in that it entertains while it is playing. The story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said band starts to go on a kill spree from beyond the grave. So yes, a bit of  Nightmare on Elm Street  plot going on here. Granted Freddy never molested a girl in a car before. There was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it, but it was very different in how it played out as it had a band that kind of took over a town of kids and made them crazy. This one simply has the one fan of the band kind of helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him. Nothing to gruesome in it as I do not remember all that many gory kills. Quite frankly, the scene I do remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some creature incarnation of the band. Nothing great, but a nice time filler.#1
9401_10#What a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels it never gets Science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated, cultured audience..the kind of English language movie only done in pre-1960 England (and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever done in the USA. Its wonderful.#1
7870_10#The movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become. It has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person. No character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies and no character is 100% bad rather all are just different. The movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions. I would recommend all to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers those hip-shaking parties of Bollywood for the Page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But this is not all, then it shows how she couldnt survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she is fired from the job. Then she couldnt find a job of crime reporter and has to do Page 3 again. Not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie. I would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie. Please do not afford to miss it.#1
6360_1#May I please have my $13.00 back? I would have rather watched  Hydro- Electric Power Comes to North America . Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice, which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender. To listen to that voice again I would have to charge at least $150 an hour. And I dont take insurance. It was eerie watching Will Ferrell morph into Woody. But I dont think imaginative casting is enough. One should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie. Unless hes just doing it for the money. And if thats the case why not just reissue an All-Rap version of  Whats up Tiger Lily?  #0
7776_7#Does any one know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stacks might have been a Masseratti.Rock Hudsons character told his father he was taking a job in Iraq ,isnt that timely? I have had Dorthy Malone in my spank bank most of my life ,maybe this was the film that impressed me.Loren Bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out-acted Malone but Maloness part made a more sensational impact so she got the Oscar for best supporting role.Was Lorens part considered a leading role?Old man Hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoons of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up.In time,being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten,looking for attention,so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off.An ancient morality tale.But seriously,what were those sports cars?#1
7001_10#I have never commented on a film before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. Ive read comments saying this movie stays with you. It does. Its been almost 24 hours and I am still completely affected. This movie left me questioning my own self. How can I possibly compare myself to a character such as Ben who is totally selfless. I loved this movie. I love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end. I feel two emotions predominantly, happiness and sadness. An amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too. I so wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end, they were, forever. If you havent seen this movie, get it and watch it. Just make sure you have no distractions. Youll want to see every nuance in this picture. One for my library.#1
11418_4#Joel Schumaker directs the script he co-wrote and has a group of Georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations. The story line is a scrambled mess, but some scenes are actually good. There is a lot of wasted talent and time here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Featured are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most notable being McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is quite obnoxious. Coming of age is not so damn easy.#0
11702_4#No, I havent read the Stephen King novel  Thinner,  but I choked down the film version. Horror movies are an acquired taste. Regular movies give an audience a hero to applaud as he strives to achieve a goal. In horror movies, audiences are invited to savor the demise of characters. In director Tom Hollands low-fat but tasteless revenge chiller  Thinner,  nobody wins and everybody deserves the bite that is put on them. Gluttonous New England attorney Billy Halleck (Robert John Burke of  Robocop 3 ) has a weight problem. Although he rocks the bathroom scales at 300 pounds, he appears happily married to a trim, delectable wife, Heidi (Lucinda Jenney of  G.I. Jane ) with a yeasty teenage daughter. Only die-hard Stephen King fans will be able to stomach this misogynistic gooledyspook.#0
9209_7#STAR RATING       The Works      Just Misses the Mark     That Little Bit In Between    Lagging Behind   The Pits  The film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain, sounding like a blank Marlon Brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast, along with the obligatory cheap looking sets. But if, for some strange reason, your life ever depended on watching a Dudikoff film, this would be one of your best choices.    #1
1253_3#I read somewhere that Hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone. We can only hope. While this remake wasnt a total waste, I still wish I had the six bucks back to go toward a DVD of the original. Lots of violence and one of the worst endings Ive ever seen. This version doesnt add anything new. It only reiterates why Hollywood should leave the good stuff alone.#0
9789_1#They should have called this movie  Adopted Mouse Brother That is Slightly Inspired by Someones Vague Recollection of Stuart Little Who Just Kind of Skimmed the Book a Little, But Mostly Just Remembered the Cover  If it wasnt so misleading Id give it a better review. In the movie they screw all of that up. I think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.#0
11200_4#The good fellas at Websters Dictionary define Logophobia as the fear of words. I may just be Logophobic. For no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film, credits contain the words `Produced, Written and Directed by, and are followed by a single individuals name. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few jack-of-all-trades. Even the most seasoned of directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control of their films. But there I was, all nestled in my theatre seat, popcorn in hand and about to watch The Order when hurled at me like a Nolan Ryan fastball, were the words `Produced, Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland. Whoa!  #0
696_10#Surprisingly well done for an independent film, An Insomniacs Nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully well written, and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniac. With twists and turns around every corner, An Insomniacs Nightmare is provocative and engaging. It comes very highly recommended.#1
10219_10#When a rich tycoon is killed in a plane crash, his spinster twin sister, Martha Craig (Madge Kennedy), doesnt believe he grabbed the controls in a suicide dive (even though self-snuff runs in the family) but his three beautiful daughters couldnt care less. The pilot, Jim Norton (John Bromfield), goes to work for Valerie Craig (Kathleen Hughes) who soon coerces him into helping her wrest control of the estate from her troubled sister, Lorna (Sara Shane) and the family lawyer (Jess Barker). Valerie wants Norton to seduce Lorna when hes not fending off the advances of another sister, the nymphet Vicki (Marla English), but her plans are thrown into a tailspin when Norton falls for his prey. All bets are off as a world of woe -including corporate chicanery, seductions, suicides, blackmail, a murder plot, the Mann Act, double-crosses, disfigurement, and poetic justice- befall  Craig Manor , an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea B-Movie rating 10/10 Marla (and her body English) made marvelous movies! THREE BAD SISTERS was recently seen on the big screen as part of the Palm Springs Film Noir Festival but the jurys still wiping soap suds out of aw hell, its noir (5/10 on the noirometer).#1
5108_1#I cant help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tear-jerking. For one, its entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes.  Extreme Makeover Home Edition  is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat. Skip this one. If you like reality television,  Survivor  is far superior and moving.#0
8520_1#When I noticed that  Hamish Macbeth  was being broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled. I then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing. I adore M. C. Beatons books about the wonderful Scottish Constable. The characters in the book are entertaining and very well-written. The powers that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently have never have read one of Beatons books. Only the name  Hamish Macbeth  has anything to do with the series. Besides the lack of familiar characters, I find the whole show offensively loud. It seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other. If you love M. C. Beatons adorable Hamish Macbeth dont waste your time on this rubbish.#0
1786_4#So on the Chills Network on cable they are having  Vampire Month , Im such a dork, but I love vampires. So after a few duds that they showed I was pretty disappointed, but then I noticed Sleepwalkers was written by Stephen King. So I decided to go ahead and check it out, well much to my surprise, this movie was really bad. Most Stephen King films are entertaining and some are very scary. While Sleepwalkers was bad, it was a beautiful kind of bad. I had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was. Ive never read Sleepwalkers, from what I understand this is the only real vampire story by King, so I cant really compare book to film. I dont know if it was just my TV, but Sleepwalkers looked like it was made for TV. The special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched, even if it is fantasy, it had a lot of problems.  4/10#0
2683_3#Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail?If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. Contrived plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound. This slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line-the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out. (This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint). Later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and Bangkok is a big city, mind you, Ive been there- and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison. Cmon. Rent Another Day in Paradise instead.#0
5619_9#I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight - so, needless to say, I can easily relate to Polanskis  The Tenant.   Yes, the movies obscure. And slow. But it captures the alienating qualities of apartment living - something Ive done entirely too much of - so I dig it. Its funny how all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply significant! Definitely worth picking up for pocket change on DVD.#1
10228_3#To be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it, but im never one to let others influence my viewings, in fact im more likely to watch something out of defiance!. Bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away. The picture isnt very good, and is in fact very morally dubious, all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture. Sadly it doesnt, and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you cant help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film, nobody in the cast come out with any credit, with lead man Guy Madison painfully wooden in the extreme. Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10#0
2345_4#I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson,Lauren Becall,Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was terrible- just bloody horrible- he was supposed to be a charming jet-setting millionaire- instead he came off like a jerk from the word go- the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3  romantic  leads had no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress- although her campy tramp character was boring- think the older sister from Splendour in The Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. Had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on Get Smart#0
993_2#Im going to write about this movie and about  Irreversible  (the (in)famous scene in it). So you are warned, if you havent seen the movie yet. This are just my thoughts, why I think the movie fails (in the end - pun intended). Good intentions (Talia and Rosario had worked before), but failing to convey most of the things, they set out to do (even if you can see what they meant, it has to be convincing, otherwise it doesnt work)  not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are #0
635_1#Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luises character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Munis character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luises performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.#0

6513_9#To Be Honost With you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didnt go into theaters,The Deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used,There are a few dull moments when the storys following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday gets the props it should.The very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer,The property he buys turns out to be where the Witch(Tooth Fairy)lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger dont wanna give anything really away just a little info if youve wanted to see this movie then do so its worth the price of the rental#1
7393_1#Im a huge Steven Seagal fan. Hell, I probably weigh as much as he does although I dont have the street cred to sport the frizzy-mullet-ponytail. Having stated my own bias and affection for Americas favorite corpulent stage and screen hero, it is with a heavy heart that I must declare this to be his worst movie ever. Im not sure he could make a movie any worse than this. After this I dont know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me for listening to his CDs. Is it time I start checking out some of the Van Damme direct to DVD nutty logs? If you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet. A lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this.#0
4417_9#This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution. It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love.  The revolution, like the film JULIE, never seems to have an ending.#1
11987_7#Since it has been some years since I reviewed this classic I have decided to go back and review it more in dept, but first some insider notes from a movie critic. Now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much, to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like Talespin being released again to the TV screen instead of all the new ones, give me back my childhood cartoons, give them to the kids i have some day, give them again#1
8009_1#In The Lost Son, a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring. This film incorporates all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst-case scenario that exists only in the minds of Hollywood, the press and AG John Asscrap. If you get a chance to see this, youd be better off getting lost yourself.#0
3198_3#In short, the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing, somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast, and the 3rd act  there virtually wasnt ANY 3rd act! Otherwise, you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version to at least get some laughs out of it.#0
7670_1#Well where do I begin my story?? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money. Boo.#0
5669_10#In her first nonaquatic role, Esther Williams plays a school teacher whos the victim of sexual assault. She gives a fine performance, proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool. As the detective out to solve the case, George Nader gives perhaps his finest performance. And he is so handsome it hurts! John Saxon is the student under suspicion, and although he gets impressive billing in the credits, its Edward Andrews as his overly-protective father who is the standout. Bathed in glorious Technicolor, The Unguarded Moment is irresistible hokum and at times compelling drama.#1
4789_4# Phantasm  of 1979 was a highly atmospheric, creepy, scary and very original Horror flick, and, in one word, cult. The first sequel of 1988 was gory, witty, action-packed and highly entertaining. After the first sequel however,  Phantasm  creator Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas.  Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead  of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it even is quite entertaining, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to bring in something new, are at times tiresome, which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors.  All things considered,  Phantasm III  is an acceptable time-waster, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two  Phantasm  films can give it a try, but I recommend not to set your expectations too high.#0

4648_1#This is a bad B movie masquerading as a mockumentary. The porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character. That completely destroyed any  documentary feel  that they may have wanted to create. Someday, someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry. This is not it.#0
2640_2#Trying to conceive of something as insipid as THE SENTINEL would be pretty difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes. There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel as to be laughable. The action is too easily stymied by the  What the?  responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie.#0
1070_8#Jessica Albas Max and Valerie Rae Millers Original Cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial. Wonderfully politically incorrect. Quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but generally the standard is high and when it is not, Jessica is always worth looking at. Valeries urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging Dark Angel into sitcom territory.#1
68_2#Ned aKelly is such an important story to Australians but this movie is awful. Its an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America. Also Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accentit is the worst film I have seen in a long time#0
3096_1#For starters,  Hobgoblins  tries to ape the more successful  Gremlins . Thats bad enough but they dont even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here. Instead, its more like a bargain basement, everything-must-go clearance of embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound FX, acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws em down the old tube-aroo. One star for  Hobgoblins , seven stars for the MST3K version.#0
7580_1#This was an awful movie. Basically Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to the American forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid for an American military family, they all regard her as being Korean even though she looks more white (I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian, not at all Korean), and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the U.S. military in Korea is depicted is completely insane. Of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men whove never spent a day in Korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in Korea for either Koreans or American GIs and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic Asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie. Anyone whos ever been to Korea will know this is utter garbage. In the end the North Korean honhyol spy-girl gets killed, in an obvious  paying for her sins  way. Very bad film with a made-for-TV feel to it.#0
2107_7#I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay. Usually, I am into war and action movies but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies. Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. Yet still, I liked it a lot. If you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.#1
9465_7#Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. But, the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable. Through-out, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important. Though, it came down to old, flat and predictable ending. Id reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad, even) this movie would get better publicity. Still a fun movie.#1
8564_7#I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of Romania. This tells something certainly about the value, or maybe about the lack of universality of the film, but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. The film is splendidly acted by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega-star, we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art. Although suffering from a hesitant story-telling and falling sometimes in non-essential details or character comics, the film is still an important landmark for the Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the Romanian society.#1
7083_1#My husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense. (He never reads the synopsis). Alexandra Paul, who is usually watchable, plays an embarrassing scene here. There are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam. Dont even waste time renting this. 0/10.#0
12002_1#This is a sad film made for sad people. I was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart, wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe-inducing scenes after another. And there were people roaring with laughter behind me, which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse-s  t. Nikkhil Advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters. The screenplay is dull, probably he was drunk when he was writing this film. There is no strong hold on any of these stories. Nothing new , nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before. One of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it. I mean seriously is this story really required? Its not funny, not creative but only proves that Advani has no sense of comedy. Another of the stories (which was probably the only story I was interested in) is based on a mans infidelity and that too ends in a lame age-old sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar crap. I have no idea what the Salmaan-Priyanka plot was all about. There was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot. She cant take Karan Johars film because she has to marry Salmaan ?? Why cant she marry him and still take the film ?? or does Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married?? With six actors in the film obviously Advani cant produce the film all by himself. So he makes full use of sponsors like the Times group, shamelessly promoting their Filmfare magazines. And also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore  I come to IMDb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film. It just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are. With fans like these, movies like Salaam E Ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit.#0
3454_8#First off, Im not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact Im not even a huge Justin fan, but I did like this movie. overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. I dont know why it didnt appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage Ive seen on the big screen. I would say its worth seeing.#1
1549_10#There are movies, and there are films. Movies are more often than not merely cinematic  candy,  whereas films are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well-placed in the latter. As most viewers, I was highly impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what I consider to be the most sterling quality of the film. Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Deutschland, all the while in the throes of morphine addiction, die Fraulein is treated very shabbily by the German high command despite all of her efforts. The scene in which the Doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a Mercedes Benz command auto, alone, desolate, and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a  spys  lot in life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the Spy Who Came in from the Cold comes close. Fraulein Doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing. I only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again and again)enjoy this exceptional motion picture.#1
5214_2#METAMORPHOSIS I am working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of  The Atom Age Vampire,  which also featured a scientist striving for similar results. Set in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. As others noted, the end turns into a 30+ minute gag, which is seemingly endless. Without giving too much away, Id call this one,  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature From the Black Lagoon meets Home Alone.  #0
1187_3#Nope, I am just not going to get with it here. I refuse to go along with the program. Dont you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over-rated? Look at the reader comments and their star ratings Most are 6/10, 7/10 or better. I think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself, which is unique. How many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog DVD titles? I watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation, expecting fireworks, and instead got someone popping a Gucci shopping bag. It looked great, but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending didnt do much to save it. 3/10#0

9908_8#God Bless 80s slasher films. This is a fun, fun movie. This is what slasher films are all about. Now Im not saying horror movies, just slasher films. It goes like this A high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders, and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong. Disfigured and back for revenge, sporting a Joker/Jester mask (pretty creepy looking, might i add), Marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later, after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion. That is basically the plot? Whats wrong with that? Thats the beauty of 80s slasher films, most of them i would say. A lot of things could be so ridiculous, but they keep drawing you more in an in as they go by. Especially this film. One last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well, Marty Rantzen. A disfigured, nerd, who kills all his old foes in a creepy Jester mask. A good villain makes a good slasher. Simon Scuddamore, who played Marty apparently committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released. That alone adds something creepy to the film, and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the Marty character, i guess. All in all, great 80s slashers fun! Its a shame it will never be the same again#1
9796_9#In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for Direct-To-Video, but bumped up to theatrical status. It would become known as Batman Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the WB, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. Overall, while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago, MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan, you will love the five-minute short Chase Me.#1
8610_10#Diane Keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton,(Natalie), The Family Stone ,05, who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe. She always called her and told her,  Surrender Dorothy , which was an expression used in the Wizard of Oz,1939. A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughters friends and lovers. As Natalie investigates, the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. Great film to view and enjoy, especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors.#1
10984_10#One question that must be asked immediately is Would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? This is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort.#1
9240_10#Found this flick in a videostore, it cost $2 to buy. The whole movie stinks really bad! The so-called colonel, who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted, must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk. He nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense given the old mans inability to DO anything worth mentioning, a now two terrifyingly eighties-looking guys take over, in what must have been some sort of story. I got lost a hundred times but didnt mind, because the movie is so bad, its real fun to watch. Zero-Budget trash with actors not deserving that name. Go check it out!#1
9075_1#The Slackers as titled in this movie are three college friends Dave, Jeff and Sam(Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel respectively), who are about to graduate from university without sitting through an honest exam but making it end successfully. This continues until the very end when unlikeable but the most likable character of the movie Nathan(Schwartzman) figures out what they are up to. Nathan starts blackmailing in order to make up with his dream girl as he cant pursue that in normal conditions. The only problem is when the trio starts to work on it, Dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good hearted Angela(James King) Unfortunately, not a brilliant genre movie. Schwartzman makes to watch the movie easy as his performance is brilliant. Kings performance is average, I think she was hired just to be around with her gorgeous look. The Slackers is reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. Jokes are as shallow as in American Pie. But arent they all used? I think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality. Overall, a few smiley moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting(except for Schwartzman) and subject.   out of      #0
3470_1#As with most of Ben Afflecks movies, the comedy is dry and story is predictable. That is if you want to call this a story. Many points were left connected with no thought at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say that because, that would mean the torture would have lasted longer. As for any of Ben Afflecks failures, this one is no exception and is survivable only by the other actors. Even then, the acting for the most part was contrived and was not believable. The trip down memory lane with actors I have not seen in years was not worth the price of admission. All thought it should be told, they too are quickly joining the ranks of the  has-been . My choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all I would give it a one laugh  mainly because that is all I got out of it.#0

9573_1#Not totally off the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid.  Killer Tongue  is an uneasy mixture of sci-fi, horror, and supposed comedy. What this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film. There is very little dialog, mainly due to the fact that the script, if there was one, is complete  pond scum . I wouldnt even call it strange, more like just  total nonsense . This movie is certain to disappoint, and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish MERK#0
9487_8#The first time I saw this film, I was in shock for days afterwards. Its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention, helped by good acting and some really intriguing music. The ending, quite simply, had me gasping. First rate!#1
1173_8# Night of the Living Homeless  was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains. The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10#1
9956_9#Beforehand Notification Im sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here, but when I saw the preview for this movie, I was thinking  Finally!  I have yet to see one movie about popular African-influenced dance (be it popular hip hop moves, breaking, or stepping) where the main character was a Black woman. Ive seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-Black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it (Breakin, Breakin 2, Save the Last Dance, Step Up), but the Black women in the film are almost nonexistent. That always bothered me considering so much of hip hop, African-influenced dance, and breaking was with Blacks and Latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasnt always men who performed it, so I felt this movie has been a long time coming. However, the race does not make the film, so I also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watch. I wouldve given this movie five stars, but the music playing killed it for me. I definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs.#1
2817_9#This review is for the extended cut of this movie. I suggest everyone who is a Hong-Kong cinema, or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.(Or at least thats how I think it was intended. Why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes) When I was done watching it, I felt like I had watched a completely new Jackie Chan movie although most of the sequences were the same.#1
7748_2#This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it. I really dont know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo/theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar. What was it, oh yeah, Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tigers instead. The acting is extremely cheesy, the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers could almost pass for clay models, and even some of the sounds were off. For instance, when one of the college students is trying to escape, he uses an ax to break down a door, the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. The cheesy deaths were quite funny though.#0
7930_1#This piece of crap might have been acclaimed 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the Native American Indians played by white men. The right-wing Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life, just like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971 Stewart had actor Hal Williams fired from  The Jimmy Stewart Show  (a short-lived series that mercifully flopped) just because Williams was black. As if that were not bad enough, this film is very dated and boring. Watch  Dances with Wolves  instead for a less racist view. 0/10.#0
2453_4#I might have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jacksons trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison. The pace of this movie is rushed, many important scenes from the book are left out, and there is little character development. The animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over, which I found distracting. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished. There are some good points- the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter. Watch this one if youre in a hurry and cant spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you havent read the book youll probably be confused, because there is a lot missing from this version. 4 out of 10.#0
9980_8#Any movie that shows federal PIGs (Persons In Government) to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me. Despite its obvious flaws,  Vanishing Point  is a film to cheer.#1
8923_8#The Blob is a classic 1950s B-movie sci-fi flick. You probably know the story two teens (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they run into an old man with some weirdblob attached to his arm. They take him to the doctors office, and then go to find out what happened. From there, the blob spreads, eating everyone in its path. The special effects are cheesy fun, as is the story. There are a lot of great touches, like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district. Its no masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.#1
9100_7#Spanish films are into a, if not Golden, definitely a Silver Age. Piédras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or death-level, they still arent really melodramatic. This could happen. Definitely worth seeing. Its in Spain the moviemakers take women seriously.#1
11008_9#Youll notice by the stars Ive given this GREAT film that before you see it the first time, is implied. I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not much great coming in). Im not sure how this movie slipped past me -I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Still, it did. Great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films.#1
2967_9#Ernest Borgnine was so wasted in this movie.There was no point in putting this great actor in this movie.One of the greatest actors in the world wasted,and for what reason, none what so ever,so america if you want to put classic actors in movies DONT WASTE THEM#1
1156_2#Watching The Tenants has been a interesting experience for me. It is the first film I have ever seen where I have shuttled at speed through parts of the (non)action - and I can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to Serbo-Croat indie and find them fascinating. Strangely, I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; his eerie, clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable.#0
4845_1#There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award. Well, it does not deserve an audience as well. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly, the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least. Every frame, you feel you are getting the  full picture , its like someone is  cropping your view  from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I will be honest, I could not bear to watch the entire movie. The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. Take my advice, stay away from this piece of crap.#0
5621_4#Im an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film. After watching it, however, I honestly believe that I could have made a better documentary myself. Its arguments appear to have only four spurious sources (despite his being listed in the credits on IMDb I didnt see Richard Dawkins anywhere), its edited together crudely with laughably amateurish computer effects, and it doesnt make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial. The narration is pervaded throughout with a sneering, almost adolescent anti-Christian sentiment, ruining any possibility that the film might actually change someones mind as opposed to just preaching to the choir (i.e. me). Though there is some interesting discussion of the historicity of Jesus, the movie hits an unbearable snag when it begins to dwell heavily on the Christian school which the director attended as a child, an institution which apparently scarred him badly psychologically as it obsesses him to this day. Though TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of Christianity. Theres certainly a dearth of skeptically-minded religious documentaries on the market, and this film could have helped fill the void. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end appears to be some sort of therapeutic exercise for him. Its too bad that his Christian upbringing traumatized him, but he neednt subject an audience to his coping mechanism.#0
2143_4#I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn. The movie itself could have been its own story, I think that it should have been just that. I wouldnt say that I hate it, but I believe that it had many shortcomings. It seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original.#0
2108_4#A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. She discovers that right before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (supposedly from the groom) which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them. Patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a secluded estate, with his wife. In reality, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, by putting the brides in a suspended state, and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who is working with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) try to force Dr. Lorenzs hand by setting up a phony wedding, which eventually leads Patricia into the mad doctors clutches. This movie had a very good opening reel, but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes. The cast is decent, Walters and Coffin deserved better, but thats life. Russell steals the show (even out hamming Lugosi- who does not give one of his more memorable performances, even considering his Monograms) as Countess Lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of todays Hollywood prima donnas. Weak and contrived ending as well. Rating, based on B movies, 4.#0
4197_8#Shock Corridor (1963) was my first film from Samuel Fuller, and there I was impressed with the directors astute blending of B-movie and big-budget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock. Pickup on South Street (1953) was released a decade earlier in Fullers career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a big-name studio, Twentieth Century-Fox. Nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that theres a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike Dassins The Night and the City (1950) and Kazans Panic in the Streets (1950) {the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald}. In some scenes, Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors faces that theyre out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye. Though (unexpectedly) prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anti-Communist propaganda, Pickup on South Street is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City. Richard Widmark, an actor who Im really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of ill-ease that suggests hes biting off more than he can chew. The opening scene on the train is the films finest, as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victims hand bag, recalling Bressons Pickpocket (1959). Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street-woman wholl peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it (though, of course, she draws the line at Commies). Jean Peters is well-cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow-legged strut of a prostitute. Nevertheless, Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the films attempts at realism. Fascinatingly, upon its release, Pickup on South Street was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI, and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite. Go figure.#1
8268_7#This is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. And, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haines is  Tom Brown  and his main rival,  Bob  is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in a supporting role is Jack Pickford--always remembered as the brother of Mary. Of these three, Pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes Toms pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clichés are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. However, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing. 4/25/08==I just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920  Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be 1 is anyones guess.#1
7772_2#This is one lowly film. It has no real plot. We never are made privy to motivations, other than wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then its being controlled by these three older people. Why are they doing what they are doing; in order to strike fear into other members of the group? I dont know. There is some mist from a fog machine that rolls around in the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it. Does it do something? I dont know. Theres some nudity for its own sake. Im always surprised to see this in films this old. Things have actually settled down in this regard these days. Anyway, the people run around like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plan; no resources; no nothing. There are about five silly climaxes in the film. Who are these people and  is  there a ghost or demon. What happened to the other people? I challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence. What a mess.#0
11047_2#There are two reasons why I did not give a 1 to this movie. One reason are some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) work, who tried to play at their usually good level of acting. However at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting. Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogs, bad script work. And it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors. It could have been an interesting story though, but they failed completely.#0
9060_8#Saw this today with my 8 year old. I thought it was cute. I agree with the other poster that it wasnt anything like the book that I can remember, but we still enjoyed it. All of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining. Billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day. If he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the movie is set up to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and pukes at almost anything. Hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms. Good message about standing up to bullies and of course, a sappy happy ending.#1
5520_1#This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. It left me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I would have known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I am tired of it. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I am extremely disappointed. It has been several days now and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I have never been more disappointed in a movie, nor have I ever written a comment on a bad movie. I really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, no one would have seen it.#0
6619_1#This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema  Could not wait for it to end. To make matters worse it is given a 12A certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot, just bodies slumping to the ground, even Babban getting killed was cut out  Too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as I think the makers knew it would flop disastrously  Amitabhs acting was great but that Basanti wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgans mate cant even act. Devgan was wasted  I would not watch this for free again and I advise all others who read this to do just the same YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED #0
11840_4#Anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events were about to see cant ever be known and  This is the whisper [rumor] most often told  about one of Hollywoods most sensational  mysteries.  This isnt on par with Bogdanovichs trashy, so-bad-its-good  At Long Last Love.  Its perched on attempting something serious, but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because its so full of bitterness towards  the beast  named Hollywood. This is  National Enquirer  filmmaking. And it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the Oneida that weekend, but the audience gets pretty dirty as well.#0
9646_1#The Lack of content in this movie amazed me the most. First i though that people was going to compare this to Rock On! but im really surprised myself to say that this was worst than Rock On! So-so story Horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you gotta be kidding me. The music was Okay Khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad! Vipul Shah hasnt still learn from Singh is Kings critically bashed comedy. Now Asin.. where do she come from sorry for Asins fan out there but she suck d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didnt look good at all overdose of make-up! My final verdict go watch Aladin with your family instead wasting your time here.#0
5985_3#This film is just a kids against evil genre. Thunderbirds is just the hook to get people to see it, but are almost incidental in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a ploy to pull in the public. It was interesting to note what the film makers view of future London will be and how the World all fits together. Having said that it passes 90 or so minutes in a fun way and so may just be worth watching.#0
6629_1#If you have seen the Sholay of 1975, Dont watch this movie. If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975, Go WATCH IT. But do not watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of Sholay.  If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. )#0
7780_3#I could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd, but I decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe  something  would happen. This is the work of a writer/producer/director/special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie. Thats what he wanted, anyway. What it turns out to be is a lot of acting, either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river waters (oh, and what luck, a woman just happens to be naked in it even though there have already been DISAPPEARANCES!)  If you happen to get the Elvira DVD double-feature of this (bad print with bad transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, make sure to skip this one. Unless, of course, youre an Elvira die-hard and cant help yourself to hear her luscious commentary; personally, Id rather get Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots from Mystery Science Theater on this roast turkey.#0
9631_10#A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The Boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of Professor Noodle, a mad scientist whos just perfected his rejuvenation serum. Stan & Ollie proceed with their DIRTY WORK, spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the Professor wants to try out his new potion A very funny little film. The ending is a bit abrupt, but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific. Especially good is Stan & Ollies contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney. Thats Lucien Littlefield as the Professor.#1
110_1#I have this film out of the library right now and I havent finished watching it. It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although shed pretty much finished with it in Robin and Marian. This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. Its really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide. A great lady who was once a fine actress (as in The Nuns Story) and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50s and 60s who became a truly bad one--thats not all that common. And perhaps it is only a great human being who, in making such things as film performances trivial, nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly--which all of her late film work contained in abundance. Most of the talk about Hepburns miscasting is about My Fair Lady. But the one that should have had the original actress in it was Wait Until Dark, which had starred Lee Remick on Broadway. Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part. After that, all of her acting went downhill.#0
2674_7#If the redundancy of getting off the boat, on the boat, off the bus, on the bus.. is a way to waste time then you should go back to the Hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots. and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life. The long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and wait- in-line feeling the characters must endure. Frustrating? yes. Vital? Indeed. the limbo of that travel is the key to the rootlessness of this Turkish family. Beautiful film with great acting. Sad, but worth it.#1
4682_4#Yep, lots of shouting, screaming, cheering, arguing, celebrating, fist clinching, high fiving & fighting. You have a general idea as to why, but can never be 100% certain. A naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points, but then youd probably spot the many flaws. Not an awful film & Hackman & Washington are their usual brilliant, but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on. Im still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other & dont argue, but then you probably wouldnt have a film. 4/10#0
10763_8#I must admit that I was very sceptical about this documentary. I was expecting it to be the kind of All American Propaganda that we here in Europe dislike so much. I was wrong. This is NOT propaganda, in fact it is hardly political at all. Regards,#1
11414_9#A great storyline with a message. Joan Plowright is superb as  Phoebe , Mike Kopsa is hilarious as  coach  and Richard de Klerk plays the role of  Carmine  superbly. Mischa Barton as  Frankie  puts in a good performance and Ingrid as  Hazel  plays her first lead extremely well. This film is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The editing is first rate.#1
5237_1#One of, if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s.  Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. Its no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbars only work to make it onto the screen. Complete and utter rubbish on every level.#0
11803_7# Sasquatch Hunters  actually wasnt as bad as I thought. Rated R Graphic Language, Violence and some graphic carcasses#1
6412_9#Im certainly glad that a film was made about Carl Brashears amazing life story. Coming as it did during the Civil Rights era, Brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected. Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.#1
5732_1#Im all for a  bad  horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sh!t! How anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me. If you like rushed editing to cover the special effects, bad acting and a bad script then go for it! There was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake. Ill take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile any day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows a stinker when she sees one. I on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better. No such luck! I havent sen his other movie Torched and I doubt if Ill bother now.#0
12060_3#Offering a killer combo of terrible writing, terrible acting and terrible direction, its a tossup whether Kinjite Forbidden Subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad. Its almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest, seediest Cannon film. As if a glance at a cast list including characters like Lesbian Pedophile, Perverted Gentleman, Porno Actress werent enough, its your only chance to see Charles Bronsons cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo - but dont worry, its okay, as the offscreen screams make clear hes only torturing him for information. After all, even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice Catholic daughter, hes a nice Catholic cop who regularly brings local Catholic priest William OConnell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice - or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine. But then thats what you get for telling him  Look, I think youre a little bit unstable.  Still, when later offered a bribe, he may snarl  Id like to shove this up your ass, but I dont want to get my hands dirty,  hes clearly learned where to draw the line instead, he just makes him eat a $25,000 watch and sets fire to his Cadillac. The anal obsession even follows through to the films title despite the poster featuring a naked Japanese girl on a porn film set, the films only direct example of Kinjite/forbidden subjects, as Alex Hyde Whites English teacher explains to a group of Japanese businessmen, is, er talking about your bowel movements in polite society. Somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is, but the execution is pure Rising Sun the Archie Bunker Version, shot like out-takes from an R-rated 80s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot-em-up-and-blowem-up finale that sees a small army of machine-gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count. The last of Bronsons mostly bad to in different collaborations with J. Lee Thompson  and sadly Thompsons last film as director - its a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to.#0
10441_10#Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but its suffice to say that its one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as its about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does, at least thats deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And  yet  there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the town, in Vienna, until his plane the next morning. Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. Whos to say you cant suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklaters thesis, but theres more to it than just that. Its a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking on the phone in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the others friend. A+#1
4549_1#Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel  The Celestine Prophecy , which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present so-called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum, while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy-handed direction of Armand Mastroianni. Even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of ABCs  Lost  or Dan Browns  The Da Vinci Code , the filmmakers are hardly up to the task. This film reeks of ill-conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda, and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point.#0
8998_4#Stephen Feinberg, who Played the Proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie, passed away in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in Hollywood years earlier, working mostly on TV promos. He asked me not to see Tunnel Vision, but it was too late, I had seen it already! Actually I had seen it years before, when it was released. At that time I didnt think it was that bad a movie. However seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different. Yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated. Steve admitted it was not a very good movie. That said he was just a little proud of The Proctologist sketch.#0
6306_2#Working at a video store I get to see quite a few movies and on occasion I try to watch some of the not so big movies. Proud happened to be one of them. The initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during WWII had some merit. However in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in WWII. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. This primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie. I commend the men that served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured. A movie should have been made focusing on the accomplishments these men did for themselves, the Navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is racism during WWII.#0
11487_10#As always, controversial movies like this have mixed reviews. You either love it or you hate it, and not everyone will like this movie. This shows the perspective of the killers, which is something I personally feel is something important to consider. You may hate them, you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate, but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective. All in all Zero Day is an excellent movie, and I think everyone should at least check it out. In the past, we have always simply branded killers  psychopaths  and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence, but as Zero Day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that, and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers.#1
4616_10#The title of this film is taken from a party game called  Seven Minutes in Heaven.  The game was popular among my husbands friends when he was in junior high school in Brooklyn, NY, and he describes it as something like  Spin-the-Bottle,   Lifesaver Relay,  and other preteen kissing games. According to the rules, a boys name and a girls would be drawn, and the chosen ones ordered to get into a dark closet together and to stay there for seven minutes. In the meantime, there would be speculation among party guests as to whether or not the two had the nerve to hold hands, embrace, and/or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet. At the end of seven minutes, the game leader would say,  Times up  or knock on the closet door, and the couple would emerge from the closet. After being quizzed by the other guests, the couple would have to admit what they had done during their  Seven Minutes in Heaven.  Then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. The couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winners of the game. Such games have served as social  ice-breakers  for children and teens, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating to shy individuals. The film has been given this title because it deals with the teens first experiences with crushes and romantic love.#1
2048_7#A brutally depressing script and some fine low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good location shooting in Ohio power this fine TV movie about hard times in the rustbelt. As the mills close and the union jobs disappear, the blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone management, owners, their wives and children. Strauss is completely believable in his role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he put on weight. The heavy metal score -- was someone making a pun? -- is, at times, obtrusively annoying, but the cinematography by Frank Stanley is knockout, particularly the mill scenes.#1
9423_8#I cant say whether the post-WWII British comedies produced at the Ealing Studios are an acquired taste or not, but I am completely addicted, and The Man in the White Suit is one of the best. No need to go into the well-known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic Sidney Stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight. Many of the well-known faces from the world of British character actors - the nervous Cecil Parker, the suavely devious Michael Gough, and the bluntly ruthless Ernest Thesinger - put in wonderful performances. Guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and Joan Greenwood is delectable as Daphne (just the way she enunciates the word  Daddy , makes the entire movie worth seeing).  Knudsen   #1
6097_10#I dont see how you can say that Freddys Nightmares is cheesy and a rip-off. You obviously dont know good TV when you see it. The episodes are packed with drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddys Nightmares and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are Saturday Night Special,School Daze, and Love Stinks. If you think this series sucked then youre entitled to your opinion but remember its only your opinion and it means nothing. Freddys Nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and youll come to accept that fact soon enough. If you dont like it then dont watch it but dont deny its brilliance.#1
7609_10#An absolutely brilliant show. The second season began where the first ended, with much mystery. Suspense in most, if not all episodes and mystery everywhere. One that made me think and think again. Its truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful. Never fail to excites and I am looking forward to the new season. Hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time, more mystery to be solved. Good selection of cast too for this show, fit the characters perfectly. Really cant wait to finally discover the secret. Hopefully all the hype wont spoil the ending.#1
9525_8#ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newmans score . Its haunting and beautiful but youre aware that this music is similar to Newmans other work and while listening to the soundtrack youre reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION youre reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLERS CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leones gangster epics. Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldnt be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you cant help thinking what a superb director Mendes is  ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . Ive never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but hes every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newmans performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadnt decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career#1
6420_4#OK i will admit, it started out very pleasing and good, but then it just dropped downhill, i cannot believe Sarah Michelle Gellar could have even finished reading the script after about 5 minutes into the movie, the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie, was i wanted to see the twist at the ned, and to my surprise, well, folks i cannot even tell you if there ven was one, because the end just leaves you confused, and then the credit role, i was like what the hell? this did not deserve a theater run, i am sorry, but it didnt i mean it was horrible, the only reaso i gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumpy partsthats it! you can watch it, im not telling you not to, hey you might even like it or even love it! but if you hate it, dont say i didnt warn you!#0
5991_8#A sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces in name only, The Angels Wash Their Faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the Dead End Kids. As a matter of fact, with the presence of the Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for continuitys sake. Another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately , this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.#1
82_1#This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get  terrorized  by this pathetic  crazed killer , but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that theyre stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Dont let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.#0
1171_4#I can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works Ive quite enjoyed. The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word but  enduring  will do), left me in a vile mood, a condition relieved only by reading the IMDb user comment by ali-112. For not only has Rohmer attempted (with success) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century France but, as ali has pointed out, has shown (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times. The director has accomplished something undeniably difficult, but I question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor.#0
540_4#ALL FOR LOVE ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon`s army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . There`s also a storyline involving a murder . I`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at teatime . Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of French prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen . You really do have to worry if BBC schedulers have any type of clue as to what they`re doing#0
2860_9#It ran from 1959-1973. Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50s , psychedelic 60s and remained popular in the 70s. I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.#1
1179_2#Unreal  movie , what were these people on?? A mix of French Upstairs Downstairs, mating horses,porn (not suggested, its pretty full on for a film) & bestiality with a bit of Benny Hill music & chase scenes thrown in, its sounds crazy & its even more so to watch.   spoiler   It plods along in a tedious fashion for quite a while,. then a Lamb does a runner, prompting woman in period dress to run off after it, she goes into the woods where she is set upon by an erect  penis  attached to a man in a bear/rat manky suit, I put it like that as its obvious the  penis  is in charge & gets way too much screen time, ejaculating for the most of it, anyway, in a nutshell, it turns out she liked a bit of bear/rat tadger & thats about it, the rest is just padding.   end spoiler   A film made to shock & offend, thus getting talked about, any publicity is good publicity I suppose,a waste of time really, but the  main event  has to be seen to be believed, its hard to imagine that anyone thought it was a good idea as they filmed it.#0
11765_4#You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A sappy, trite verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. We have seen it before. You might enjoy this movie but please dont say that you were not warned.#0

10682_1#So Im looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called End Game. It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller. Well worth a look then. Or so I thought. Of course, this didnt make it to the cinema, and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room; it is appalling.#0
7933_4#Im a huge Randolph Scott fan, but this film is a dud. The whole thing has a canned, fake, soundstage feel to it, with truly awful rear-screen projection. It has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script, which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters. The directing is pedestrian, and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it. Ive seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable  soundstage productions  before, but this is not one of them. All it does is make you appreciate the gritty Scott/Boetticher films all the more. There are definitely worse Scott films out there, and this one certainly isnt unbearable, but it also certainly couldnt be deemed anything beyond mediocre.#0
12232_8#As a collector of movie memorabilia, I had to buy the movie poster for this film which, now that Ive finally seen it, has to be the best thing about it. Theres nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man. However, theres nothing more awful to put in your VCR than an hour and a half long image of the melting man. At first I thought this movie was pure garbage but then I realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson has to be the most wishy-washy persona ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so trite its unbelievable! ( Its incredible! He seems to be getting stronger as he melts!) And could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time Steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to  help  him? If this movie was meant to scare its audience, I think it missed its calling.#1
3857_9#Paul Verhoevens predecessor to his breakout hit Basic Instinct is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabbé); a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there, he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him. The acting in The Fourth Man isnt anything to write home about, but its solid throughout. Jeroen Krabbé holds the audiences attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct, but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoevens direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view, all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish, but he obviously has talent and its a shame that he doesnt put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films Ive seen, this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me, its worth the effort.#1
11032_7#Wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge, an ace mountain rescue climber Gabriel Walker (Stallone) comes back for his girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner), while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening, a spectacularly precarious mid-air hijacking goes wrong and $100 million taken from a Treasury Department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing  With breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures,  Cliffhanger  is definitely Stallones best action adventure movie#1
11985_3#Ever wanted to eat worms? Heres a documentary to show you how! YeahThe kid eats live worms! And thats about the most interesting part of the movie. I gave this one a very generous 3.#0
1625_7#A surprisingly good movie! It has quite a few good jokes thru out the whole movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extremes to show just how stupid the two main characters are. We get it, stupid blondes, get on with it!  So all in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave it an 8/10, but lets not get crazy.#1
10199_7#As a kid, I loved this game. I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this one even existed. Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Lasting Appeal B-#1
5215_2#Its the same old,  If I cant get the funding for my project, Ill inject myself  monster movie. There is nothing new here. Its a lot like the Jeff Goldblum  Fly  movie. The man manages to keep some semblance of sanity, but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments. The acting is pretty bad. There are people acting stupidly all along the way, putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. The guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter. Then theres his relationship with a young woman and her son. Admittedly, he is good looking, but he seems like a lot of trouble. Its just a pretty big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a Star Trek convention.#0
7291_2#In order to hold the publics attention for three hours, we were treated not so much to a familys romp through four generations and 120 years of Hungarian history, as to sexual liaisons with a sister, a sister-in-law and other adulteries. Oh yes, there was also a totally gratuitous rape. Having said all this, the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual - thanks to Jennifer Ehle.#0
118_8#Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Hollands own Holocaust film Europa Europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII. The American, named Leo, doesnt fully get what hes doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since, in his mind, its about time Germany was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds, he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German, merely mixed up. His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germanys horrors and enigmas. The characters, music, dialogue, and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth, Barr on one and Sukowa on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as Max von Sydows voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.#1
3921_1#This short spoof can be found on Elites Millennium Edition DVD of  Night of the Living Dead . Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. In execution, its a different matter. This short didnt even elicit a chuckle from me. I really never thought Id say this, but  Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2 In Shocking 2-D  was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring. My Grade F#0
6920_8#A fine western, following the fate of those who possess the prize winning gun, a Winchester 73. It has a great cast who give superb cliche characterisations with help from the usual effective story telling direction from Mann.#1
8019_1#I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly. I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful. It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great, or I wouldnt have bothered to see it the other day. I like supporting indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. Those that walked out, as I considered doing after about three minutes, probably didnt mind shelling out $11.00, or just figured it was going nowhere, fast, and not going to improve. Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are..either that or they didnt pay to get in in the first place. Additionally, the title makes no sense at all. 1/10.#0
11183_2# People I Know  is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about -- despite the game efforts of a talented cast. This movie is strictly for those who like watching Pacino strut his stuff, and enjoy the other principals. Unfortunately, between the script and direction,  People I Know  is strictly amateurish. Hence its limited theatrical release, and speedy journey to DVD. Consider yourself warned.#0
10090_8#I was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue, but was pleased to find a fast-paced script, an underlying moral, excellent portrayals from all the actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense, and beautiful cinematography--theres even a shot of the majestic stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic, before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work. All the supporting players round it out, and I do wonder who trained all those elephants. If you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.#1
10027_7#Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d  n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and wont do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie  Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.#1
2345_9#I really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more. A little soft on the crime front (its almost an afterthought and not terribly suspenseful or fleshed out) but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming. Will be watching again for sure!  Check it out.#1
5310_10#Pecker is another mainstream film by John Waters done on a smaller than Serial Mom. The title character of Pecker has a hobby of taking pictures of anything he sees. It doesnt matter if its dirty or shocking when he takes pictures. He soon uses the pictures he taken and puts them on display at his work. Pecker live in a semi-normal middle-class family. His dad works at a drinking bar with a claw machine, but doesnt make enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street. His mom runs a thrift shop and loves to dress-up poor people. His older sister, Tina, works at a gay bar where her specialty is trade. His younger, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar, and nothing but sugary food. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays ventriloquist with it. He also has 2 friends. On of his friends, Matt is a chronic shoplifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a laundry mat as if she was a dictator. Soon, a tourist from New York buys his pictures and displays them at an art gallery. With the picture comes fame, but the pictures expose the unusual life style of his friends and familys simple life. For an R-rated film, Pecker is sure tamer than most of Waters previous R-rated films and even Pink Flamingos. Another 10 out of 10!#1
7768_8#This gloriously turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirk at his most high strung. It eschews the soft wistfulness of  All That Heaven Allows  and the weepy sentimentality of  Imitation of Life  and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension. And of course, its all captured in vibrant Technicolor. Grade A-#1
538_1#Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat there, both thinking, this has to get better, these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap. Unattractive characters, hackneyed script, and listless pacing make for a long two hours. I actually couldnt hack it and left to do the grocery shopping (cat litter being more appealing than this film). The husband stayed and confirmed that it didnt get better--by the time Buddy is killed, you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful scenery and costumes cant keep this one alive.#0
10096_7#Robert Standishs novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a Ceylonese tea plantation So the events of the Ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to William Dieterles film The movie gave Liz a change of scenery, and allowed her more creative energy and self-respect than most of her other willful debutante-rebels The wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will, and so Taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for#1
8374_7#OK, this movie was cool. I dont think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. My brother and I still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in. Enjoyable all the way until the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. Judgment is victory for Robot Jox.#1
11656_2#Scary Movie 2 was a grave disappointment. Simply referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter. The movie plummets from there unfortunately. The acting is awful. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. The movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) I dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers. Overall, a very poorly done movie.#0
9179_10#This is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work. Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared  not handsome . But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre. This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it. Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true romance in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original. The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this.#1
8345_3#This movie could have been so much better, especially considering the talent. Larenz Tates portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. He doesnt lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are Larenz Tate, when he should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has Hollywood written all over it. The powers that be obviously pushed it, but it only made the characters more unrealistic. The positives of the movie were Miguel Nunezs portrayal of Little Richard, and the cameo of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. Its too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this film was a wasted opportunity.#0
345_7#The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced. Apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the twist). In those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it. The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.#1
3774_8#In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Teds excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future. The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as I appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot arent as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.#1
8060_1#What a bad, bad movie! I tried watching without fast forwardingThat failed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing, boring movie. I dont think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one  The one funny thing is that I watched  The Killer Cut  version of the movie. The box boldly states  More Blood!   More Sex!   More Terror than the theatrical release!  Yikes! If this movie was horrible with all those claims I wonder just how lame the  UN-Killer Cut  was??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living & the world of the dead watch any of The Night of the Living Dead series #0
10832_10#If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy in this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in main role. The story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and song  The Flame Still Burns  is perfect. You have to watch it.#1
8567_10#I enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time. Dont take the film all too seriously because remember its Disney and its rated G. Its good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice, particularly the  triangle  between Cruella, Le Pelt, and Cruellas faithful valet Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and really has made Cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is  cured  of her fur loving ways, she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater. (I even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her bipolarity as the dog loving Ella.) All in all I will go see it again in theaters, I found myself enjoying it so much.#1
479_10#Emily Watsons Natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I have ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. Or, is she transmuted to the king? The internecine weaving of the chess games and the families struggles for control, power, and victory is stunning. Just as the chess masters in the film do, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once, but all weave into either major or minor patterns. The period, the costumes, and imagery of early 20th century Italys lake district is captured magnificently. Not a single square of space is wasted. This is a magnificent movie (10/10).#1
2815_10#Cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre movie of some run-of-the-mill dudes. Total 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie in its genre. Thank you for attention.#1
11034_9#Eric Valette is obviously a talented film-maker, and so are the two guys who wrote the script. Therefore Maléfique is a great flick, made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination. Well, Im a bit exaggerating, but nevertheless Im sincere. So, if you like dark, gory movies, go and see this one. Its really worth it.#1
8045_1#I am so confused. What in the world was this movie about? What was the killers motivation? He seemed quite angry, but I have yet to figure out why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which I guess would make it a hill. Or a pile. Of crap. The acting was horrible. When I searched for a few of the actors in this movie, they had been in very few things that I had heard of, and that came as absolutely no surprise. I cant decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad, or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again. Starting . . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Really, though, dont waste your time with this. Theres so little substance that theres nothing there even just to make fun of. This was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks -- NO, one of the worst flicks of ANY KIND, that I have ever had the misfortune to watch, and Ive seen quite a few.#0

The fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine. Everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it. Seriously. I felt like it killed several brain cells after I watched this garbage. The positive reviews of this a$$crap were obviously made by the  filmmaker  (and I use the term VERY loosely) himself and/or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life.

So I Netflix that, and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its  very long wait.  All this time I am getting more and more eager to see it!

7453_10#I have always been a huge James Bond fanatic! I have seen almost all of the films except for Die Another Day, and The World Is Not Enough. The graphics for Everything Or Nothing are breathtaking! The voice talents WOW! I LOVE PIERCE BROSNAN! He is finally Bond in a video game! HE IS BOND! I enjoyed the past Bond games Goldeneye, The World Is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire, and Nightfire. This one is definitely the best! Finally, Mr. Brosnan, (may I call him Mr. Brosnan as a sign of respect? Yes I can!) He was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game. AT LONG LAST! DUH! Ive seen him perform with Robin Williams, and let me tell you, they make a great team. Pierce Brosnan is funny, wickedly handsome ( I mean to say wickedly in a good way,) and just one of those actors who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug, saying  Pierce Brosnan, thank you for being James Bond,   If it wasnt for you, I wouldnt know who James Bond is.  Hes a great actor! I am a huge fan of Willem Dafoe even though Ive seen him in a couple of movies. His role as Nikolai Diavalo was brilliant. (Did I spell the characters name right?) LOL  He does a great job with an accent. Sometimes I cant even hear an accent. I have seen Willem, I mean Mr. Dafoe, perform in two movies Finding Nemo, and Spider-Man with my favorite actress KIRSTEN DUNST! SHE ROCKS! Anyway, He never ceases to amaze. And Richard Kiel, wow, hes definitely got the part of Jaws nailed. Ive seen him in the movies and hes awesome! As a matter of fact, my Grandparents have met Mr. Kiel, and I was jealous when they told me. But, Kirsten Dunst is at the top of my list of Celebrities that I want to meet. John Cleese was breathtaking. I have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking, and gadget creating Q! Mr. Cleese was hilarious! Ive seen him work with Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. Hes awesome! John Cleeses most recent project is Shrek 2 starring Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrews and Eddie Murphy. ( Shrek 2 is now in theatres!) GOOD LUCK 007! Oh, yeah, and as Q always says  Grow up 007!  #1
9641_1#If youre watching this movie, youre either a Fred Olen Ray fan, you found it on the $4.99 shelf at Suncoast and thought  what do I have to lose? , or you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched. Incidentally, Biohazard IIthe Alien Force is also worth a look, but doesnt have the same enjoyably crappy veneer this one does.#0
2580_3#well its official. they have just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others have been awful. I mean the story is about two college fraternitys who battle each other for its houses, I mean come on talk about a weak plot, the first three dealt with growing up, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society. The best character in this movie of course is Jims dad i dont know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films.#0
3810_9#this is my first review on IMDb, i didnt really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now, i feel compelled to add my perspectiveand no, im not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you here that before ;-) ) FYI im in my late 20s 8,5 for me#1
375_9#this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen. i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on TV i my eyes are glued to it. the acting and plot are amazing. it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics. i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.#1
9026_1#This has to be some of the worst direction Ive seen. The close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact.  The ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film. This movie was never going to be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable.#0
333_3#I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics , and I`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of Eddie Murphy so I guess this movie has something going for it The title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily . Obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated . Not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening . In fact that`s the main problem ( And boy it`s a serious one ) with this movie - The whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together . I blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too . Did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be ? It`s part fantasy , part martial arts , part buddy movie , part comedy and it`s all crap#0
9530_4#I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story. Its about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs.; I dont see where the terror comes into play here. There are some  weird and  surreal  sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke andahoh well) play the roll of two psycho-man haters to the hiltthey do a pretty good job (although some of it is just a tad over the top). The movies not good, and its not horrible; its just really really dated! I mean this thing is dripping with the 70s. Its not really bad if you like that sort of thingyou knowthat thang?#0
11649_10#What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hrs to kill, watch it, you wont regret it, its too much fun! Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isnt anything more other than him, I still liked it. The music by A.R.Rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times, you really start liking it.#1
328_10#Fascinating I approached I Am Curious (Yellow) and its companion piece with great trepidation. Id read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex. What I got wasnt this, but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other. I sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was `lame or `boring approached the film as if it were pornography. Perhaps this is pornography, assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses, but it is intentionally un-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring. Her breasts may be saggy, her nipples unusually large, her thighs fat, and her face, chubby. But by the end of the film, the audience comes to identify with her, and accept her faults as human. This touch gives her even more believability out necessity. Had the director cast a Briget Bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified. I cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece. Be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film. The patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream.#1
10911_1#I hated this movie so much I remember it vividly. It is not even funny. Any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk. All I could think was  he deserves it, for making such a bad movie . Dont waste your time or money on this one.#0
6422_1# I just viewed this movie last night and I dont think I will ever think the same about any of the actors involved, because this movie will stick in the back of my mind.  Go watch the National Lampoons movie, but stay away from this movie.#0
11188_10#I am a big fan of Stephen Kings work, and this film has made me an even greater fan of King. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They have just moved into a new house, and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. The Creeds new neighbor Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. That burial ground is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human being (or any kind of pet) up in the burial ground, they would come back to life. The only problem, is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person, theyre evil. Soon after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary, everything starts to go to hell. I wont explain anymore because I dont want to give away some of the main parts in the film. The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good, but needed a little bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this movie, mainly because it was so original and gripping. This film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie, and frightening. One of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back, was in fact the make-up effects. There is one character in this film that is truly freaky. That character is  Zelda.  This particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Creeds sister who passed away years before, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie isnt generally scary because she isnt talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the living      out of me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scares, some pretty good acting, first rate plot, and mesmerizing make-up. This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.#1
486_1#This flick was a blow to me. I guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models, home makers or mistresses, since that seems to be all theyll ever be portrayed as anyway. It is truly saddening to see an artists work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated. Inconcievably (or perhaps it should have been expected), Artemisias entire character and all that she stands for, had been reduced to a standard Hollywood, female character; a pitiful, physically flawless, helpless little creature, displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here. Sadder yet, was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film, and reality. To portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist, someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture, just plain pisses me off. If the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person.#0
9131_9#I only wanted to see you laughing in the Purple Rain. This is an excell film. It should have been re-rated to PG-13. But anyways, Princes first film and greatest. The follow-up sucked. But I havent seen for years so heres what I can remember about it. The Kid (Prince) has to juggle with winning over the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), keeping his band together (The Revolution as themselves) and the tension in his family. But his rival band (The Time as themselves) is ruining his life. Like Morris (himself) is trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry and if you luv it, buy it.#1
8122_10#I never saw this movie until I bought the tape last year. I was enthralled and entertained. It has all the elements of what I love to see in a Sci-Fi story, in a book or on the screen. Theres social commentary, speculation, and a good story. I think its a must see, and not only for Sci-Fiers.#1
9976_1#The first scene in Problem Child has a baby peeing into a nuns face. For this movie, thats witty. A nasty, mean-spirited comedy, its inept on so many levels it beggars belief. John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from Hell, and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note, annoying performances and puerile humour. And what the hells Jack Warden doing in this mess? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when its done with the crudity, the movie is made so badly its quite a bizarre experience. But never mind all that. The lowlight of the whole thing is Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen  believe me, you will want to smack him right in the mouth.#0
8485_3#From the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the Fiend. Its all tiresome, slow moving, unimaginative drivel. It was OK seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around. Visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time, but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this. I just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic. And then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned. Perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someones pants pocket.#0
1895_10#I watched this over the Christmas period, I dont know why but it reminds me of Christmas so I watched it, so there we are.  I can watch Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film.#1
3096_10#Six degrees had me hooked. I looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replaced its time spot. I thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised it ended. We could relate to the characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters. There wasnt anybody on the show I didnt like and felt the acting was superb. I alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas. I for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give it a good time slot, dont keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on.#1
9857_7#While I loved this movie, the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high. I own the DVD, so dont get me wrong, I am not saying dont watch it or even buy it! Its just that I still think the first scene was the best, and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it.#1
2375_8#i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds ive every seen. it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie. my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it. in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better. but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up.  thank you#1
6082_4#Although there are a lot of familiar  television  names associated with  A Man Called Sledge , there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960s-70s television series like  The Rat Patrol  is a bigger cast and a lot more violence.  Then again, what do I know? Im only a child.#0
6435_7#I think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie dont understand how to watch a movie and/or have little sense of elegance. First, to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together. Modern sensibilities demand great drama. No, I dont mean great setting of characters and plots, but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic. This is a subtle movie. Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. It is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness, politics, human weakness, venalityyou name it. The world its set in would be alien and not understood todaya world where if you have it you have to flaunt it NOW and LOUDLY, even if you only think you have it. This movie helps set the record straight.#1
4991_10#Its a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the US. I found it through a rare video dealer, and it was certainly worth it. This is, without a doubt, the best film made during the pre-code era, and the finest film of the 1930s. Masterful director Frank Borzage made wonderful films about the Depression, and with MANS CASTLE he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era. MANS CASTLE is the crowning achievement of the pre-code era. If only more people could see it.#1
5480_10#This is a great movie, it shows what our government will to to other countries if we dont like their government. This isnt as bad as what Reagan and Bush number one did to South America, but the US still has no business messing around with other countries like this. This movies also proves that American media spouts government propaganda. This is exactly what they did to Aristide in Haiti. The reason this coup against Chavez didnt succeed is Chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote. The other reviewer is lying when he says  Chavez seizes the airwaves , the private media is running anti Chavez propaganda all the time.#1
4957_8#10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was improvisedin the best sense of the word. Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other. It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view. Grady Harp#1
3383_8#Especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed (1973), this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong. Too many people, and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. Its set in New York in 2022 (I think), and it reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta. Gritty, pre-Star Wars dystopian science fiction.#1
6044_4#A well put together entry in the serial killer genre that unfortunately gets mired down in its own pretentiousness to be really satisfying. Willem Dafoe is superb as a NYC detective trying to track down what appears to be a copycat using the same Renaissance art-related killing techniques used in a series of murders he solved years earlier. Scott Speedman is Dafoes junior partner and they have pretty good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters pop up to conveniently tie the two cases together. Clea Duval is the friend of an earlier victim and Peter Stormare is some sort of art broker/mentor to Dafoethats a bit hard to take, although Stormare is, of course, never dull. The films ending is particularly disappointing. Look fast for Deborah Harry as Dafoes less than forthcoming neighbor.#0
9349_8#I didnt really go into  Reign Over Me  knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story. The plot was easy enough to understand, I suppose. This guys whole family died in 9/11, and he shuts the world out of his life. Alright. I didnt know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it, and it really doesnt on a very obvious level, so if youre scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours, I wouldnt worry about it. I think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention  September the eleventh . The movie takes its name from the song  Love, Reign Oer Me , off of The Whos rock opera, Quadrophenia. The song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story, but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax, and at the very end. The movie is paced well, and does not feel like its dragging anywhere in its length, which is a little over 2 hours. If you can accept Adam Sandlers portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man, you will enjoy the movie. You will become entangled in the story, and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it. It is not the best movie of the year, and theres nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it, but its a very enjoyable, watchable movie, all in all.#1
5835_2#Ah WINTER KILLS , based on the novel by Richard Condon which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago . I knew Condon also wrote THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller A dire movie thats an ordeal to sit through#0
4511_9#I just picked up the DVD release of this movie while on holiday in Norway where it has been released with English subtitles. The films only weak point is the rather clichéd Flower Power teacher who uses every friendly teacher trick in the book. Other than this I feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy.#1
11145_8#After Racism, Rural exodus -also known as migration from the country side- is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view. It has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away. Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.#1
1449_9#This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesnt mind his Louuu-siana accent. He may come off as annoying if you cant stand this dialect. The way that Pacinos character interacted with Cusacks character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times. Danny Aiello was superb as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many. It may take a second viewing to remember,  which Zapatti was which?  After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap. The ending didnt have a lot of sting. It was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the movie wasnt billed as a  huge, blockbuster  big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great but the films lack of  splash  in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations. It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there. Made in 1996, it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come. So, make yourself some lemon pudding (youll see) and see this movie #1
8594_7#The Sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was right.A great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it wasnt and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keither Sutherland is too,but however it is very hard to shrug him off his role as Jack Bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in The Sentinel than he is in 24.also another person trying to shrug off their TV role but failed.Eva Longeria.She wasnt that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thing.After i saw the film i had constant dreams about The Sentinel and couldnt sleep.Overall Sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it.#1
4685_7#In Lizzie Bordens  Love Crimes  (1992), Sean Young plays a gritty D.A. in Atlanta. Shes a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes compromising photos of them, then leaves them. Dan (daneldorado@yahoo.com)#1
5469_4#This film might have weak production values, but that is also what makes it so good. The special effects are gross out and well done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious, as are the other members. This film is actually trying to make a point, by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4/10 Fair comedy, gross out film.#0
1527_7#Savaged when it came out, this film now looks handsome and sounds great. A feast of intelligent thoughtful acting, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook,and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesnt jump around and show off- his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greenes script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity.The piece has the look of a made for TV movie, and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that. Too many contemporary movies on historical themes cannot resist dumbing down. What would Mel Gibson have made of the Maid? Many drooling shots of her on the rack probably, then crisping up on the BBQ as the flames take hold. Preminger does none of this. The burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction. There are a few weak performances, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and was not expecting to watch it through, but I was gripped . In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joans story has unexpected resonance.#1
8236_1#I cant believe this is on DVD. Even less it was available at my local video store. I give a  1 , since I cant give a  0 . I just dont see any way this movie could be entertaining.#0
6119_9#okay, but just plain dumb. Not bad for a horror/comedy film. I was reading how people switched it with the Michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe (never seen it) the horror (possibly comedy) uncle Sam, ill have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on VHS of Amazon and got it November 21, the day before thanksgiving. worth the four bucks, l.o.l. at this film. 9/10#1
11788_8#I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one. First of all, I find this short-film very entertaining and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher. One other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story, just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on. No-one else could have done that better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism at its best. Sure, I will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewers side, will find themselves disappointed. And in good right. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. The one that helped make Lost Highway/Mulholland Dr. is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else, will just not get what this is all about. My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about messing with your animal-core, your instinctual self, by giving you the means (image, sound, situation) by which you instinctively react. Its not about pleasure of any kind, its about getting the desired reaction out of you. And, that, my friend, is pure art.#1
8979_2#It was Jon Pertwee who said   It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly   . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is   Very easy   . David Baker ( As Director /Screenwriter ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK.. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin . PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise . I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there - This film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in America - People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . So we`ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film . Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , but this doesn`t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy#0
9441_9#The makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters,as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.The horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors,playing parts.I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on screen,as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty,Ronny Cox,Bill McKinney,and though he appeared only briefly,James Dickey,the man who authored the book upon which the film is based,as the sheriff of Aintry.It is somewhat disturbing,and kids,of course,should be shielded from it,but this is great,dramatic cinema.#1
10806_9#I felt this film - throughout. I waas impressed with Russell Crowes talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, such a typical Aussie blend of softly softly approach, a bit self depreciating and very persistent. Really loved the cinematography and direction. Pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive. Gosh, didnt Russells talent even in 1993 shine! .. and I have yet to see Gladiator.#1
6680_2#Wow, what a snoozer. Definately one of bacons worst films. The bad acting coupled with a formulatic, if not incredulous, script make me yearn for time I wasted on viewing this on cable television back. Not really much I can say about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to the person hes recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by (spoiler) a basketball game. Grade F+#0
11860_10#This movie has it all. It is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana(played by Al Pacino), is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in America. This cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of Miamis Drug Empire is astonishing. Brian DePalma does an amazing job directing this picture, so much that, the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline, as well as every character in the cast. With Tonys characters pressence being so believable and strong, Brian DePalma brang out the raw talent exposed by Steven Bauer(Manny, Tonys best Friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio(Gina, Tonys Sister), Robert Loggia(Frank, Tonys Boss)and Michelle Pfeiffer(Elvira, Franks Wife). I enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and still watch it on a weekly basis. On this year, the 20th Anniversary of this classic crime movie, I for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers. With other crime movies being so dramatic I find, this movie is a shock to the system.#1
8592_1#To make a film straddling the prequels and the  real  Star Wars trilogy would tax even a great film-maker.Mr Lucas is not that film-maker. No the film only picks up with the Chancellor turning on the Jedi and has one great (overlong) sequence at the lava falls#0
6183_7#Financially strapped Paramount pulled out all the stops for this 34 stage adaptation entry big budget, large cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen tagged as the director. What happened? Two things Busby Berkeley didnt work for the out-of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didnt deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street. I have to believe that the cutting was out of Leisens hands since the great Duke Ellingtons number is savagely chopped, but that doesnt mean that it aint worth a look the Sweet Marihuana number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower, considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing Toby Wing (whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied Jack Oakie. Carl Brissons acting is bland as Melba Toast but hes a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective. And try to spot Lucy in the chorus. This rates a 7.0 as a curiosity. Feb 2010 re-think I recently gave the film another look and now feel I was wrong to berate the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I can understand Leisens argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. I still have enormous issues with the editing however. Paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the Production Code at the worst possible time in its history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934s Search for Beauty). A must see for pre-code buffs.#1
6008_1#If you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, please dont give up on the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and already Im almost finished with book 10. I dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesnt do the series even a sniff of justice. While  Left Behind the movie  only vaguely follows the story of the  Left Behind  (the book), the characters arent even close to accurate. And thats just from the first movie; theyre about to release the third. Please, even if you didnt like the movies, give the book series a chance.#0
6384_9#It is written in stone that Disney animations simply ~must~ be musicals. Right? Where? Show me. Because I found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~not~ containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard Disney musical fare.  the Fiend .#1
9912_10#Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notchI highly recommend this movie. Her performance, in my opinion, was Academy Award material! The only real sad fact here is that Universal hasnt seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format, whether it be tape or DVD. They are ignoring a VERY good movie. But Universal has little regard for its library on DVD, which is sad. If you get the chance to see this somewhere (not sure why it is rarely even run on cable), see it! I wont go into the story because I think most people would rather have an opinion on the film, and too many  reviewers  spend hours writing about the story, which is available anywhere. a 10 #1
3252_9#The story of  A Woman From Nowhere  is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a Eastwood Spaghetti Western A mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place. Even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the location is in a town somewhere in Japan. Id highly recommend film if youre a Ryoko Yonekura fan (which I adoringly am) and/or a  girls with guns  movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings. To me, theres something eminently and inexplicably appealing about  girls with guns  movies like  La Femme Nikita  and  The Long Kiss Goodnight.  And to have a gorgeous gal like Ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake.#1
11798_10#Ive seen this film literally over 100 timesits absolutely jam-packed with entertainment  Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981)I never thought an actor could capture the  intensity  like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as Im concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jonesthis film captures his best performance #1
4469_9#Usually musicals in the 1940s were of a set formula - and if you studied films you know what Im talking about - a certain running lenghth, very  showy  performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc. Why not a 10? Near the end - at nearly 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a bit long. There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now. But overall, this ones a definite winner on every level.#1
7523_1#Once again I took a chance and rented this bag of crap. Billed as a horror flick, there wasnt one scene, not one, that was even remotely scarey. NOT ONE  Sure there was some nudity, but all the lesbian action got a little old. I guess maybe that was suppose to be this movies saving grace? And Dan, what an annoying ass bag  Right from the beginning I knew I was in for it when good ol Dan first spoke. And he was suppose to be intimidating? What a laugh  All in all, this movie is dreadfully awful! How in the hell do movies like this get made? If you want a movie with a few thrills in it, dont rent this one. This movie is about as thrilling as the Teletubbies.#0
3884_1#Many moons ago when I was seven years old, I can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie. It appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. Being the wise adults that they are, they told me  Absolutely not! Its a bunch of trash.  Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid on my block to see the  Incredible Melting Man.  Dont make the same mistake that I did. Listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie. They were right.#0
3282_3#The Dukes of Hazzard will academy awards  Best actor and actress 4 the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie. I gave a empty DVD so this  movie  could be burned 4 me. I sat trough it and i want my money back #0
947_2#As someone who lived through,and still remembers that decade vividly,if the actual 70s had been half this funny and (semi)normal,they would have been so much more enjoyable.Actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright-eyed and normal as these kids did.The countrys youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that 60s rebellion that it spawned,especially in the behavior department;the petulance,the smugness,the self-righteousness,the childishness,the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters exhibit any of that. Someone compared to  Happy Days ,and I can see whyThey were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast,and they both offer only surface ,cliched depictions of the actual eras,not even close to the full scope of it,just showing the obvious things - the fashions,toys,music,contraptions,etc,and thats it.For those too young to remember,or werent born then,trust me,the 70s werent like that,any more than  Happy Days  were like the actual 50s,as  M A S H   didnt accurately portray life at a US Army medical base during the Korean War,etc.#0

2963_8#The creators of south park in their own film here, this is a brilliant film with a huge entertainment factor. If you like Naked Gun films and are not young and not too mature or serious on your humor, youll love this.#1
3404_2#Im not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f|u|c|k|u|p|s, it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isnt even remotely possible. Others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities already. Im surprised NASA let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you havent seen this yet, save yourself the irritation. Watch Apollo 13 again. At least that tried to be sort of real.#0
9617_2#Three years ago, Rachel(Therese Fretwell) was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and drowns. Rachels friends think it is time for her to stop beating herself up and taking blame for something she had no control over. So grab the brew and something to chew and head back to the same lake that has been in Rachels constant nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath has already started when two of the friends are splattered before even heading to the party. This flick has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and winged itvery badly! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the meatier role as Rachels boyfriend Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel there are some pretty lame acting and a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of before they get offed. Giving attention to a few more players that had the nerve to appear Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one MEMORIAL DAY you wouldnt mind missing.#0
9721_7#How to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach. I recommend this fun and worth watching American with English cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit, relax and enjoy movie for what it is. If youre about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it.#1
2328_3#I saw this recently and I must say, I was moved by the factual basis of the story. However,  Holly  as a movie did not quite work. I am however, looking forward to watching the documentary which the producers who organised this project had made because I think that would be a much more compelling work than this film. I believe in the films message and intention, but I have to be fair, so I rate  Holly  3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie. But I think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and I am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which I hope will have its debut on BBC and other TV networks.#0
892_10#sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything. great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos. the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button, as its one of the best end fights Ive seen. sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow.#1
5846_3#Yes, this is one of THOSE movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. I have watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other comments give the idea well enough. The characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge, the acting-- oh the acting-- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses. But not for more than 99¢, OK?#0
830_10#I didnt have many expectation going into the film, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role. He has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play off each other great, and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time. The humor is dark, the performances by Brosnan, Kinnear, and Hope Davis are great, mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship, and you have a great film. This is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time. This is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of Brosnans career.#1
10232_1#Its one of those dramas thats so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely dire, direction appalling, lighting purely armature, the only thing letting it down from a true so bad its good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesnt at least destroy any speeches. Theres continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout. And finally last but not least the acting is appalling. For a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this.#0
9361_9#Reign Over Me (titled after the who song) is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyones eye. It was a moving story of a guy (sandler) that lost his family in the 9-11 world trade center attacks. Years later, he runs into an old college roommate (cheadle) that he doesnt even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress ensued by the loss of his family. The two rekindle their old friendship and Cheadles character, Johnson, realizes that he must get Sandlers character, Fineman, some help before its too late. This was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time. Its completely worth watching and after seeing it, Im positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more.#1
860_8#Audiard made here a very interesting movie. It begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman, in its working universe as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected Hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life  but the guy is just coming out from jail. Their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively. Charactersdescription is profund, goes into detailsboth start to help each other; for she can read on lips, which reveals itself to be very useful for himShe will progressively evolve, far from what she was at first. Its beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even if it turns into a film noir at the end. Gesture is in particular beautifully observed in Audiards filming. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated at the Best Actess Cesar Awards for her magistral play. Action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple  etude de moeurs . Its actually surprisingly entertaining  8/10.#1
5837_3#i cant say i liked this movie very much.it has some amusing moments,but it doesnt seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a drama.it doesnt really work as either.its too light in tone to be a drama,and the amusing moments are few and far between.it also doesnt make a lot of sense.things seem to happen for no reason.and its also extremely convoluted.i feel like they just made things up as they were going.if they had just taken a bit of time to explain things,this might have been a better movie.i would say the ending was anti climatic, but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to something,which it didnt.it just sorts ends,and thats that.i didnt find it boring,really,but like i said,there there just isnt any point.ill give Winter Kills a reluctant and weak 3/10#0
3660_1#I saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently, on one of those dollar DVDs that seem to be everywhere nowadays, and was so moved by it that I cannot contain myself. For those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable Mexican import, and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone elses jaundiced commentary, there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows. So if you are one of those reckless individuals, stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself. If you get drunk enough in advance, you might be fortunate enough to pass out before its over. Of course, one doesnt really expect any sense from a film like this, but at least it ought to be good for laughs. This one isnt. Forget it, buddy. There is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film, from its patched-together, tequila-drenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score, that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any MST3K type laughs out of it. If its not even good for that, what the hell is it good for? If Montezumas revenge could have somehow been digitally remastered and put on a DVD, it would have looked exactly like this movie.#0
10807_1#This movie has successfully proved what we all already know, that professional basket-ball players suck at everything besides playing basket-ball. Especially rapping and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is. First of all, is it just me, or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a can-opener. Secondly, why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when, even though he has magical powers, he sucks horribly at making music? Third, I have read the Bible. In no way shape or form did it say that Jesus made genies. Fourth, what was the deal with all the crappy special effects? I assure you that any acne-addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that. Fifth, why did the ending suck so badly? And what the hell is a djin? And finally, whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the Eiffel Tower, because this movie take the word  suck  to an entirely new level.#0
9137_10#This is the only movie Ive seen Prince in but it dont matter. And I thought he was only great at singing boy was I wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is great. Thats why it won the Oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and Grammies under his belt. Although the cursing gets in the way with the film (just make sure no little kids or in the room). There isnt to much to say without revealing the plot. You should really go out and get this movie your collection isnt complete unless you got this movie in it. What else could I possibly say except for go and get this movie now!#1
1622_8#I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas  Fats  Waller, Bill  Bojangles  Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (notwithstanding) Louis Armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed  Cotton Club  in Harlem. True stereotypes are there, but this was the way it was and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature.  Disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well for example, 1937s Silly Symphony  Woodland Cafe . But we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now clips of the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park will be also scrutinized, analyzed and even vilified by future viewers.#1

3055_9#In his first go as a Hollywood director, Henry Brommell whips an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issues with melancholic authenticity, and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of a father-son hit-man business. The film is directed astutely and consists of a wonderfully put together cast as well as a swift, family-conscious screenplay (also by Brommell) that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre. As a bonus, Panic delivers subtle, acerbic humoran unexpected, undeniably charming, and very welcome surprisethrough its bumbling, unsure-of-himself, low-key star, whose ever-cool state is enticing, especially given his line of work. Henry Brommells brilliant Panic is something of a rarity in Hollywood seldom seen (with the exception of 2002s Road to Perdition) since its conception in 2000it weaves two conflicting genres (organized-crime, family drama) into a fascinating, warm hunk of movie-viewing that is evenly strong in either directionand its one that will maintain its exceptional, infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for ages to come.#1
6323_1#This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you cant go out for recess, and youd rather be watching anything, ANYTHING else. At least thats what it was like when I was in elementary school. I just remember HATING this movie. Granted, I havent seen it in 15 years or so, and they probably dont use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone Youd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them. Trust me, pick anything else. Even though the topic is kind of controversial, the plot is so tame and slow that I cant remember anything about it except that I disliked it so strongly that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn all of you against it.#0
8580_4#If my memory is correct, when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy - a funny look at the adult entertainment industry. If thats what its supposed to be, it doesnt really work. It just isnt that funny. Setting that rather significant (since this is called a comedy!) failure aside, since I have no personal knowledge of the subject matter, Ill avoid comment about the authenticity of the story - which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a Toronto massage parlour, except to say that - if this is true - the life is pretty dull.  The performances from the 4 leads were all OK, although I didnt think anyone came across as outstanding. All four characters were a bit shallow. Cindy was a sympathetic character, and so was Conrad for a while, although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie. Given the subject matter, theres surprisingly little nudity (and what there is is restricted to one scene.) In fact, there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this. As for the overall quality of the movie, its a low-budget effort, which shows, although you expect a certain griminess, I suppose, of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour, so thats forgivable. It certainly says something, though, that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer-director Soo Lyus resume and - given the normal lack of depth in the Canadian film industry - that it wasnt even deemed worthy of being nominated for any Genie Awards - the Canadian version of the Oscars. 4/10 - and Im being a bit generous with that.#0
312_2#If youve ever seen this movie, youd know that it! If you havent, and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie, because it ranks right down with the worst. So, if youre REALLY bored, go rent it. If you want to know what its like, heres my little summary Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adam doesnt like how one passenger is getting all the babes, and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes. BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! Youll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is.#0
5427_3#A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest looking like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom (horror mainstay, Karen Black, the only remotely good thing about this travesty) buy. The actings pretty laughably bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scares or suspense to be had. This film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last. People looking for a similarly themed, but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of  Friday the 13th the Series  where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. That packs more chills in its scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across its 4 films. Eye Candy Charlie Spradling provides the obligatory T&A#0

419_7#This Cecil B. DeMille epic of the old West contains what may be Jean Arthurs finest performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral, but devotedly doting Calamity Jane. She really pulled it off! Gary Cooper is at his most taciturn, but manages some occasional pithy sayings The plains are big, but trails cross  sometimes. The story is a pastiche to end all pastiches. All the cowboy heroes of Western lore seem to be in there somehow except for Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story in person (or at least, DeMille would have us believe so). There is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety, this is a stomp em in the face tale for the masses. A remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what Eisenhower was eventually to name the military industrial complex. It isnt just a story about gun-runners, but about arming anyone for money, and doing so from the heart of Washington. But lets not get into politics, lets leave that to DeMille, who can be guaranteed to be superficial. The chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by George Antheil, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, Bad Boy of Music. Antheil seems to have originated the big sound adopted by all subsequent Westerns, whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies. That is why it does not sound at all unusual, because we have heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into American mythic lore, and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then, corny as it may be, but doubtless appropriate. It is amusing to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian. Gabby Hayes is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. Gary Cooper overtops them all, looming large, - but when did he ever loom small?#1
1535_9#Thankfully as a student I have been able to watch  Diagnosis Murder  for a number of years now. It is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing. The main cast gave good performances and Dick Van Dykes entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM was the fast pace, witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score. Sadly it has been unfairly compared to  Murder, She Wrote . DM is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it is gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of feelgood, family friendly cop shows. Now there is just depressing gritty ones.#1
8690_8#Alain Resnais films are uncanny in the way that they arent really edited for continuity, but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited. Love unto Death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie, and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the Eros/Thanatos relationship or perhaps creates a new relationship, that of Agape/Thanatos. --PolarisDiB#1
4480_1#Let me start off by saying that I didnt watch this movie at first with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies, and  MTV  was pasted on the front cover so I was not expecting much. What i was expecting was a tear-jerker, overly dramatic but at least effective. Overall, the movie is just garbage. Im a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this crap, not even close. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere.#0
7937_10#I thought the movie  I Do They Dont  was fantastic. In the past Ive watched Rob Estes on  Suddenly Susan  &  Melrose Place  and also Josie Bissett on  Melrose Place  and loved seeing them together again in  I Do They Dont . They have great chemistry together (I guess being married in real life helps that!) - in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball. Of course they stumble, but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about. So many people have been talking about this movie - all good! - and the movie left us wanting more. This would make a great series - appealing to many ages! - it would be so nice to see a real life, down to earth, family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so called  Reality TV  that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days. Someone tell the people at ABC Family they have the start of a new series here #1
7448_2#I watched this film version of R.D. Blackmores classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 A&E version was released on video. And what a poor substitution it proved to be  This version does not have the authentic, I-feel-like-Im-there aspect of the A&E movie. The actors are, for the most part, wooden (with Sean Bean the exception) and the  romance  seems forced and contrived. In fact, there is no kissing until the end of the movie  The triangle between John Ridd, Lorna Doone (or Lady Lorna Dugal, whichever you prefer)and the evil Carver Doone isnt mentioned or expanded upon. We dont get much insight into Carver here, or as to why he has some (if any) romantic feelings for Lorna. This movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel, such as Counsellor Doone, and Johns sharp-tongued youngest sister Lizzie which were crucial to the plot. The screenplay itself is lacking in conviction. The political intrigue also doesnt figure in the script. The way Lorna came into being with the Doones isnt true to the original story. Now, dont get me wrong, Clive Owen is a handsome and talented actor (watch Gosford Park and King Arthur for confirmation) but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout, and long hair (it may have been a bad wig) just doesnt suit him  Polly Walker is a lovely and accomplished actress (see Enchanted April and Patriot Games, in which she also costarred with Sean Bean), but she appears colorless and lackluster. She has a cold sore on her lip that make-up cant hide, and the costumes dont seem authentic. The late Robert Stephens does a respectable turn as Sir Ensor Doone, although he only refers to Lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter, which she was reputed to be in the book. Also, it seems to me that Owen and Walker are too old for their roles (maybe its the make-up) and the scenery is brown, cold, gray and barren, without so much of a hint of a sunny sky. I understand that it is set in Southwest England, but it is green there and they do get their sunshine  The portrayal of Tom Faggus character and his  death , which doesnt happen in the novel, depresses the film even more. The one positive note is Sean Beans performance as Carver. Although it doesnt even come close to matching Aidan Gillens portrayal in the A&E movie, Bean does make one mean villain. In short, watch this only if youve got a few hours to kill, but dont expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel. See any other version ( but I highly recommend A&Es film) over this tired adaptation.#0
1044_4# Raising Victor Vargas  is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y. Times crossword puzzle at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona, you dont have to  Pause  the DVD. Just let it roll, cause you wont be missing anything really important. No twists, turns, or tension. Its not really an ethnic movie, its a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. It made very little difference. Ive seen it all a zillion times before. Just plug in a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family, or an Irish family. Just the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze.  So  Victor Vargas  is a pleasant little movie. It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. But the writers let them down, giving them a flat, unspectacular script to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the  fast forward  button.#0
430_7#This was a very good film. I didnt go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting, the script, and the scenery. Miranda Richardson was fantastic and so was Joan Plowright. They stole the show. But the other actors played their parts wonderfully also. Very enjoyable film.#1
2117_1#Brides are dying at the altar, and their corpses are disappearing. Everybody is concerned, but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening, nor can they prevent it from happening. Bear with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive. Continue to bear with me. Finally, the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances, but of course, they cant figure out the improbable motive. Lets just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on If you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated to Lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered, explaining that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror films (the kind with budgets and plots). Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen!), and then the fun really starts. The cinematography and acting are OK. There are a lot of well dressed, very good looking people in this film. The directing is fair, and the script is a little better than the material deserved. Nevertheless, this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b-film fan. The best thing about it. It does eventually end, but not soon enough.#0
7630_1#A boring movie about a boring town in the 50s. How can anyone think this is a classic? The producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several movies that were way above her acting ability. I think this movie gives an insight to how bad Peter Bogdonovitchs future movies were going to be. Cybil Shepards career took a dive after being in several movies that Peter Bogdonovich produced. It wasnt until  Moonlighting  that her career started to come back. I thought the acting was poor rendition of the,  Graduate . I have noticed that this movie hasnt been shown in the US. The only place I have watched it was overseas in Europe late at night.#0
6556_9#I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single dad with a 17 year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I WISH my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others! So for me, perhaps this is PG level Fantasyland. I read many Nancy Drew books in my teen years, long, long ago. Sure THIS character was ably played by Emma Roberts but did NOT resemble the Nancy Drew I recall from the books. That is due to script, not the acting. I am very disappointed in other reviews written here. Some expect perfect connection with the books, some expect more credible situations or adult action film. I got what I expected! Good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls, And their Fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement. This is a Teen PG Movie, not James Bond! Which would YOU Want for a Role Model for YOUR Teenaged Daughter?#1

10580_8#This fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy day-to-day economic conditions during the 30s. Remember, 10 cents bought a loaf of bread back then, so this was a minor luxury for many people. Its testimony to how Hollywood did its best to make the USA feel a little better about itself. Youll note that with the studio system in Hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type-cast in similar movies, e.g. James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee . Then too, branches of the U.S. military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer, Busby Berkeley, at the end.#1
8776_2#Michael Keaton has really never been a good actor; in the Tim Burton Batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains. Here, he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living Well, this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller, but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you. Because theres way too much stuff that ends up unexplained, undiscovered and uninteresting. So wheres the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that WHITE NOISE makes a fool out of itself? Truly bad acting and horrifying edited, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever.#0
3206_4#I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie in the Cebuano language. (Not dialect as most Filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as. As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are to each other.) But I was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie. Being a Canadian, of Cebuano parents, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I was further excited to hear that it wasnt another stupid action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love these types of movies. But alas, I was short-changed. And whats with so many Filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother???#0
6496_10#Example of how a World War 2 documentary should be made,using first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom participated in this awful conflict,and archived footage gathered from around the time .I caught this on a re-run on the History channel about a year and a half back,with no knowledge really of the Second World War at the time,but it enveloped me,and now I consider myself a World War 2 buff,watching and reading any and all that I can find about it,but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary,definitely worth buying the boxed set of. This is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard.#1
10211_2#Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The single real issue is the protagonists dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life. Abundant  emotionally powerful  scenes do not go with this plot and, because of bad acting, they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to introduce Anthonys dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve, although it is difficult to speak of any characters perhaps except for Sonny. Beside him, actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to, they come off as self-indulging amateurs. I wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the plot, or the bad acting, disturbing any appeal that might be left.#0
10955_1#This is the story of two guys who found a copy of Funky Monkey. Finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local Cineplex Odeon. After seeing such classics as Every Which Way But Loose and Project X, these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome. Shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from Matthew Modine telling them Seven days.#0
2683_10#Franco proves, once again, that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema. True, much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work. Jerry Van Rooyens splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or may indeed (as one mysterious character states) be a devil, attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits. A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema.#1
10252_3# A scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters, occurring across the globe. Hoping to discover the source of these signals and whos behind them, the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals. What the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be,  according to the DVD sleeves synopsis.     End of the World (1977) John Hayes ~ Kirk Scott, Sue Lyon, Christopher Lee#0
44_2#Not sure if Im referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director Devil Hunter  sure is one bizarre horror movie. 2 out of 10, kids.#0
2334_9#Pushing Daisies truly is a landmark in Television as an art form. Everything seems to pay homage to Amelie and Tim Burton, but so what, in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare, this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not. It is just Brilliant. Truly addictive and an absolute pleasure. Perhaps like one of the Piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways.#1
11089_10#This film made John Glover a star. Alan Raimy is one of the most compelling character that I have ever seen on film. And I mean that sport.#1
524_10#I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of  Stairway to Heaven . Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what Im talking about). Such imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated extremely high by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this movie gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I can purchase it, and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.#1
6319_10#Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area I couldnt wait to see its final copy. Viewing this film at the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I havent laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time! It is great slapstick. The Russo Brothers did a fine job directing. The entire cast performs their best comedic acting No slow or dry segments George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and hes great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick. I was most imprest by William H. Macy as crook  Riley  and Michael Jeters as  Toto  they keep you in  stitches . I believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie.#1
8362_1#This is one really bad movie. Ive racked my brain and I cannot come up with one positive comment to make. The acting is atrocious. Ive seen more believable performances on cable access. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the President, and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst. Night of the Sharks isnt even so bad its good. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before its filmed. And to top it off, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack Ive ever heard. Im surprised my ears didnt start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record. From everything Ive read, the Italian film industry was dead by 1987. Night of the Sharks is like a final nail in the coffin.#0
11073_2#This is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the worlds best. The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES! This one isnt especially bad. Its especially typical and typically bad, shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction, high school level acting and  gee whizlets see what this button on the camera does??  photography. If Michael Moriarity was so intent on doing a Jack Nicholson impersonation, couldnt he at least have done a GOOD Jack Nicholson impersonation? And if the movie was shot in Vancouver, truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building (part of the  plot ) why in Gods name do we let that endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as Seattle??? Not only am I mad about this film, Im embarassed and more than a little ashamed. The Australians turn out some splendid stuff. We produce pretentious second rate piffle. Gawd #0
3515_7#Pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the murderer wanted to whack the dame, why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths youd have to worry about staying shut. Why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word? Are there really cops out there who are wise cracking, gum popping, grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner? This probably played well back before the wheel was invented, but it is so corny and unbelievable today. Catch the manic drum break by Elisha Cook; his frenetic hammering never once matched the recording. His mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync.#1
7908_2#I didnt expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out. Still, I held out hope. It sounded a bit much like  Bride and Prejudice  (L.A. guy falls for an Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B&P was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters. Two stars is being somewhat generous.#0
2064_1#Oh dear. While Chevy Chase and the gang at SNL set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level. Fortunately Chevy is barely in this at all and cant be blamed for this utter tripe. It seriously is very, very bad. While meant to be a political comment on USA at the time of its release (1974) it still remains neither funny or acutely observed. The sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as theyre all drawn out to the point of complete boredom. This is credited as Chevys movie debut and Im pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it. Avoid even if curious.#0
7966_4#CREEPSHOW 2 is the ill-fated sequel to the George Romeros (overrated) original, CREEPSHOW. Any sequel following a Romero film thats not directed by Romero himself has got some large shoes to fill, mostly because of the Romero fans out there who think hes God. I didnt care much for the first film and funny enough, I didnt care much for the sequel. The film series had so much potential but it was short-lived because both films were less than stellar.  Except for the few titillating aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile, seeing CREEPSHOW 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time. CS 2 is more rental material than something you pay to see on the big screen.#0
10320_2#I was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. And talk about hype, I even heard an interview with the shows creator on the BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world. Canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to Hollywood on a regular basis. So how come the producers of this show couldnt find any?#0
9506_8#A sober, reflexive piece, a little miniature which blossoms into a magnificent humane pictorial sequence which goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen. This quiet little story will hold you enthralled - if you do not have too many problems with the various Spanish accents ranging from Mexican to Peruvian, and Marisa Paredes more authentic Iberian Peninsular usage! Garcíadiego has accomplished a perfect adaptation from the novel even the grand maestro García Márquez should be proud of her superb work. And hats off to Arturo Ripstein who has so ably concerted the whole effort into a gem, a ruby, and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so touchingly.. This is not light commercial Hollywood stuff.#1
11643_7#I find I enjoy this show, but the format needs some work. First off, the good attributes. I like how this show will take us through the day-to-day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad theyve allowed their lives to become. This is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome. Intervention doesnt candy-coat things and sometimes the outcome (often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing) is a negative outcome. This makes the positive outcomes all the better. I used to find these  blender  episodes so annoying that Id only tell my TiVo to record episodes containing one addict, but then it became easier just to record all of them.#1
6061_10#I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. The musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production. Even though it is shot for those huge Imax theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system. The final magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, is loving father who proudly watches over his sons career. They work together so well that every father and son should see this. You can tell that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience.#1
653_1#If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the minus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible  horror  films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time. Whoever made this version of  Prom Night , you screwed up. The actors could probably have done a decent job if it werent for the questionable scripting. This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip. Id sooner go and see  One Missed Call  again, at least that had some plot.#0
889_10#This is one of the best Hong Kong (action) films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes. This Sammo film has it all, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero as well. It is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights. Sammo fans- This is a must see (See also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.#1
7333_3#I enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes, but 20-minutes in I was liberally applying the fast-forward button. Far too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walking from room to room, down hallways, through doors and down the street, and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused. Gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay). It might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that I hadnt heard said in many other films before, or if the ending wasnt - disappointingly - the one I had predicted three minutes into the film (atypical for an independent/smaller studio film). At least its heart was in the right place - it wasnt your standard formulaic Hollywood manipulative nonsense.#0
7639_8#Its not a big film. The acting is not amazing (some sub charterers are even played badly), The film is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big films, this one is not for you. yet it has a big - REALLY BIG plus on the story. Larrys story works, because we know this story from our own lives. The girl we didnt ask to a date, the test weve failed, the friend we let down, are all in our history. This movie works, because it touch it, Its a great story because its a small one. Its the life we all have, with regrets we all have, and yet the message hits every life we could have lived would have had their downside. The first time I watched it, I was 15. It was shown in a party at my school. 16 years later, I keep reflecting on it every once in a while, and every time I see it, it puts a smile on my face. Watch it. It will do you good. Youll be happier with what you have.#1
3258_10#I happen to run into this movie one night so I decided to watch it! I was very pleased with the movie I thought it was a wonderful plot. Its a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say! And this wife stayed devoted for 23 years  I thought it was a great movie #1
4303_1#Previous comment made me write this. It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist.Look,race is nothing.Im color blind.I look like Pierce Brosnan but Im no Irish. So what?I might add that I am not 100% Serb,that I have some Austrian and Croat blood within me but whats the point.Im dark, half-breed?Is that so? Anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like Lantos(producer9and director is racist for me.Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. Hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back. I am proud of being Serb and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians,Croats,Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes I am from Serbia and I have multiethnical family).This movie doesnt show sufferings of Serbs or Croats within Sarayevo,terrible terrorism of street gangs,Muslim extremism.I add I kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers Muslim,catholic or orthodox, killed in this war.This film is manipulation with our misery,false humanitarianisms which doesnt help at all.It helps Lantos to fill his pockets with more doe,alright!#0
1371_3#I cant figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad. Its like the TV station are desperate for anything, anything at all. Theyre buried underneath a bunch of snow, the electricity constantly flashes on and off, yet magically there is a background light that stays constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? That, and all that stupid bickering between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping. But because its such bad directing and acting, you will not your Florence Nightingale fix with this flick, sorry. Im joining the negative feedback, and I concur that this is one of the worst movies ever.#0
10796_1#This film proves that the  commercial  cinema ,or else,the Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis.There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on Shaquilles name.There is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot.What else?The screen is somewhat dim,ONeal is a bad actor but Francis Capra is even worse. Rating 1 / 10.#0
2657_1#I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie,  The Christmas Box  based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show, hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my  new  life. After seeing this movie I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who  think  they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child. This movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from start to stop. I had a few calls after the movie, each call the same,  That was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back  What a bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither would have EVER made the movie to be so off the mark. I guess thats Hollywood.#0
8848_7#I watched this film in a very strange way -- I had put it on my Netflix list and couldnt remember why (other than that I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it). Since the film has no opening credits, I couldnt even remember who had directed it. My final comment is about the comments -- if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on IMDb -- and the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and con -- its a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film.#1
2126_1#Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but its ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well, croons so effectively, and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy. In his more cutesy moments (with the girl in the train station, in the final number with Rosie), I couldnt take my eyes off him he was so repellent. You keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. By the way, if you see a production of the stage musical, the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie, youll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical Ive ever seen.#0
1306_7#An unusually straight-faced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget, but the drama is involving-- its one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on Cinemax 2 or More Max or whatever they call it, you end up watching 40 minute blocks when youre supposed to be going to work. Along W/  Deathstalker 2 ,  Chopping Mall , and  The Assault , a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow low-budget brethern, who has a real ability to pace a genre film, when he actuallys interested in the material (i.e., dont bother watching any of his Shannon Tweed flicks with a 3 or a 4 after the title!) Actors whove had too little to do recently (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for chrissakes) really put their all into some of their best roles in years -- as for Grieco, he has the right look, although his acting is a bit one-note -- its clear his character is supposed to be self-destructing throughout the film, but Grieco doesnt quite convey it. I checked IMDB and I see the writer also wrote  Sorority House Massacre 2  &  Dinosaur Island  for the director -- both minor classics in their own rights, but obviously  silly  Roger Cormon-like Cinema -- this ones more like some of the better Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B-pictures of the 70s -- giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time -- a real step forward. Not  Citizen Kane,  and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive, but a well-written, character-driven above-average straight-to-video actioner. Small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along, which is rare enough (as I was reminded as I tried to sit through an Albert Pyun monstrosity called  Heatseeker  the other night -- this low-budget stuff isnt as easy as it looks -- but thats another story!)#1
9674_9#I didnt give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like  Citizen Kane  and  Seven Samaurai.  However, this movie is so all-around wonderful, its a real shame it scores so poorly for the general IMDb voter. However, the IMDb voter leans to the geeky, and  Paulie  doesnt qualify for that. Its a sleeper film you wont regret watching.#1

11637_8#Scream was Wes Cravens last decent thriller. Since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of Hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night, including the disappointment of the Scream sequels. Perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him, so that when it came time for supper, he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo. Finally, after who knows how many bad movies later, he gives us a delicious, ruthless, gripping, chilling suspense thriller with Red Eye. Dont overlook this feature. There are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at Cravens recent pictures. If not for the you, do it for all the times youll see your girlfriend, or boyfriend, or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you. Wes finally gets it right. Aside from his trademark mastery in suspense, Red Eye is not without its humor as McAdams replacement Cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order. It was a relief that Red Eye wasnt a disappointment. Instead youll get the pleasure of seeing McAdams deliver another incredibly talented performance, Murphy look creepier by the minute, and Craven craft a classic traditional thriller. A flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of Cravens renaissance had it arrived right after Scream.#1
9495_8#Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80s exploitation, hooray! The pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that were dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later were up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship. Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sisters naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes? Well, Bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesnt mind at all. Sick, dude! Anyway, as kids they fled from Russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy. A friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers. When the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, theyre facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine. Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of  White Fire , but it sure is a lot of fun to watch. Most of the time you have no clue whos beating up who or for what cause (and I bet the actors understood even less) but whatever! The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded. The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and I wont reveal for what reason  Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes. Bos principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent, the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film, theres the obligatory  were-falling-in-love  montage and loads of other attractions! My God, what a brilliant experience. The original French title translates itself as  Life to Survive , which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie None #1
12084_8#A toothsome little potboiler whose 65-minute length doesnt seem a second too short, My Name is Julia Ross harks back to an English tradition of things not being what they seem -- Hitchcocks The Lady Vanishes is one example. Out-of-work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new employment agency in London, whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend. After reporting to duty, she wakes up (Having Been Drugged) in a vast Manderley-like pile on the Cornish coast, supposedly as the barmy-in-the-crumpet wife of George Macready, who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks. His doting, enabling mum is the irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good-vs-evil than she occupied in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically; we know whats going on but are powerless to tell poor Julia. This movie, curiously, is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest (and very few British) films noirs. I think its closer to the Gothic old-dark-house tradition than the American one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption; it does, however, evince a more modern, psychoanalytic cast of mind. Whatever you call it, it remains a sharply satisfying thriller.#1
11435_3#I wish Id known more about this movie when I rented it. Id put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt contrived, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple I dont care how big a part of the story line that is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. And Charlie, for a zoologist, she certainly doesnt seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made Gray fall for her? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion), the cabbie in drag, and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were such great dancers, I wish wed seen more of that, as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie). Could have been better.#0
4412_9#Ive watched this movie twice now on DVD, and both times it didnt fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude. It seems more like a depiction of reality than most other Hollywood fare, especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed. Even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint, it doesnt fail to question it, and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost, not matter what, and cruelty is a common denominator. My recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie, if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare. Dont watch if if you want non-stop action or heart-renting emotion.#1
757_8#I need to be honest. I watched and enjoy this show because it was gross, offensive, hilarious, and raunchy. Yeah, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. If you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards, for example then you will have a great time for it. Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Specially the Paco character.#1
4936_1#I wasted my time and gave this show a chance. This has to be one of the worst new shows. If they gave an award to shows that suck THIS one should sweep the category. The acting is poor and the story line is contrived. Now Dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining. That show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped. This new show, based on an insurance companies commercials, is not funny and really has nothing going for it. Possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were, and still are, repeated is what is wrong with this show. It just came to TV and already we are tired of seeing the  caveman  characters.#0
6956_2#Sorry, but every time I see a film wherein a woman sucker-punches a man and the man does nothing but cower, the film looses all credibility. So the new (female) Starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero-type than the new-age Kattee Sackhoff-- whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as  a compelling, exciting, must-see, ground-breaking performance,  by the politically correct new-speak of todays review copy editors; but in essence, it is just a tired, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse the biggest cliché on screens today. I may give this series one more shot, but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in. As James Hilton once bemoaned,  A story, please; just give me a story.  #0
570_10#Embarrassingly, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. Its a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit wild, the other brother is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly cast as the father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The movie closely follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format. Unlike most book to movie stories, this one measures up. Its a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.#1
11186_2#I wanted to watch this movie, but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off. Characters dont seem to react to anything. Consider this Heath Ledger is walking a night (through a cemetery I believe) when he is attacked by spirits, which he drives away. Once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all. When asked what happen he says blandly  attacked by demons, nothing serious. , as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire. 0 out of      stars.#0
4787_3#This entry is certainly interesting for series fans (like myself), but yet it is mostly incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, as is the sequel continuity. Some striking effects, to be sure, but we never find out what it all really means. Try to see the  NC-17  workprint version which contains the gore that was cut to be re-rated  R .#0
4382_8#Overshadowed by  Braveheart  released the same year, the two costume dramas beg comparison. I admit my bias against Mel Gibson, yet I maintain a rational preference for  Rob Roy.  Both  Braveheart  and  Rob Roy  compellingly depict Scots history in bloody, romantic fashion.  Braveheart  is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. Its also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Note its cornball usage of slow motion filming. Its violence is both ugly and glorious. It is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset. While  Braveheart  surpasses  Rob Roy  in sheer levels of carnage (not to mention its indulgent running time), the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. Its action is more understated, yet more surprising and clever. Its sex is less showy, yet more erotic.  Rob Roy  also has a better realized romantic interest. Its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period. Its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended  The Last of the Mohicans  and  The Patriot.  You may find the latter more akin to  Braveheart  with its emphasis on blood lust, with the former more similar to  Rob Roy  in tone. All the of the aforementioned movies merit their R ratings for violence.#1
4541_10#i saw this movie on cable, it was really funny, from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys, jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part. I compare this movie to  RUSH HOUR  in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case. The chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories. Enjoyable soundtrack, good script, i give it 10/10.#1
8534_10#Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia, a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident. While learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition Joel befriends slick, fast-talking, charming womanizer Raymond (an amazing Wesley Snipes) and boorish, surly, racist biker Bloss (a terrific William Forsythe), who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients hes forced to share a room with. Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving, but married girlfriend Anna (radiantly played by Helen Hunt). But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own. This remarkable movies key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste, wit and warmth, specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters ones lifestyle, including and especially your sex life (this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to make love in a motel room). Besides the expected poignancy, the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw, earthy humor thats highlighted by the uproarious sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club. The uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding, with stand-out supporting turns by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss doting, amiable mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses. Despite the grim subject matter, the film ultimately proves to be a very moving, positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit. A simply wonderful little gem of a drama.#1
5440_2#I have been a huge Lynn Peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie  Far North , and even though I loved her in her one other film  Slow  (2004) where she plays  Francis , this is by far and away her strongest role. P.S. Does anyone know where I can get another Lynn Peterson poster?#0
6020_7#A beautiful new print of  Zabriskie Point  is playing in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. Its time for a full evaluation of the film. Lets hope that the new print means that a DVD with some insightful  extras  will be out in the near future. I hope to get back to see the film a second time. Recommended highly to all Antonioni fans.#1
5125_1#As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The acting wasnt the best. Thats forgivable. Its the message thats not Give Jesus your life and everything will change - youll tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into All-American athletes. I laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. But wait, thats not all. Youll get a brand new truck, a $6000 raise, and you and your wifes struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. THEN youll win the state championship because God helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than hes ever kicked before - and into the wind, no less - all because  God wanted him to make it.  Then youll win the state championship again the next year. None of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadnt chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts. Heres what I took away from the movie God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and its all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. Which bible is this story based on? Ill bet Saint Stephen wished hed known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. It would have saved them all a lot of trouble.#0
9107_1#I was mad anyone made this movie. I was even more angry I lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this. I could have had a wax job and been more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. I was a bit confused at first but then I caught on and realized what was going on. By this time the film was half way through, and Yes I am a procrastinator but I always want to see things through until the end. So I stuck it out I watched it all. Not only are the actors not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions, they just arent convincing. Ive seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie. If you like bad movies with bad acting watch this.#0
11591_2#This film is so incredibly bad, that I almost felt sick watching it. Up until this point, the other installments had at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was suspenseful and gory. Part 2 was off beat and entertaining. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 had great music, good special effects, and a new entertaining Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything Ive ever seen before. Alice, a much prettier blond, from Part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan. At parts, this supposed Elm Street installment turns into a daytime soap. The newer characters seem harsh, and even that sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this one. He looks tired, and doesnt seem to be as gruesome. His one-liners seem out of place and different, where as in Part 4 they could be pretty funny. Leslie Bohems story never gets off the ground and Stephen Hopkins direction is so bad, that it makes my grandmother look good! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. Its also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!#0
6444_4#Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. Steven Greenstreets documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members. Naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints, but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals.#0
5989_1#wow i payed £3.50 to go see this movie at the cinema. Cant believe i wasted my time. The acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude. Probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life. I swear to god swept away is better than this. Madonna should of won and Oscar compared to these guys. An hour and a half of my life i want back. Honestly people dont see this, even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence. i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden, theses guys here of the actual puppets. pleas guys dont waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it.#0
11562_9#I simply cant get over how brilliant the pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. Its like the movie doesnt even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two. Add I have just learned recently that John Fiedler has died so to all the fans of him I am deeply sorry. I didnt mean any disrespect and I will try to be more careful of what I am blah blah blahing next time.#1
1002_3#I dont want to go too far into detail, because I cant really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film, but I had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie. The animation is crud and the story alternates between boring/pointless to extremely irritating. The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy, and the humor just did not work after being translated. It was a total chore to watch this movie, and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything - I wasnt expecting a Ghost in the Shell sequel, but I was expecting something entertaining, and it simply didnt achieve this. Yaaawwnnn Rent Kinos Journey instead.#0
4213_7#Director Samuel Fuller concocts a brilliant visual set-up cocky pickpocket unwittingly lifts some microfilm from a womans purse; it turns out shes a courier for the Communists, and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police. The Film Noir Formula is all its glory--before the ingredients became clichés--including waterfront locales, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack, and one hell of a climactic fistfight. Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are right on target, and the smart, sharp script is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for knockout supporting role as a  professional stoolie . Exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails.     from     #1
1884_3#Fragmentaric movie about a couple of people in Austria during a heatwave. This kind of movie has been done more often, and most of all, better. The stories dont really have anything to do with each other, apart from the pathetic finale people are cruel. Ugly flesh, unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point Ultra-realistic? Hardly Boring? Indeed. Not even gorgeous Franzisca Weiss can save this one! 3/10#0
2948_10#It should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like it. Murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes about dicks, pussy, tits and insaults so many famous people including his own  family . Among the people who gets it by murphy are Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life. I mean, when a person doesnt know who Mr. T is, but still laughs so hard of Murphy as Mr. T, theres something about it. At the time I saw the show I couldnt remember who Mr T. was but still laughed. Now I know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny. Because thats what Eddie do - he can make those impressions so good that it dont matter who the hell hes trying to do, its still hilarious. And on top of that, we learn that Murphy actually is a very good singer. Please watch it..#1
9680_8#This is such a great movie to watch with young children. Im always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over. Gena was good, Cheech was fun,the Russian was good, Maria was adorable & of course Paulie was the best!#1
7271_4#This could have been the gay counterpart to Gone With The Wind given its epic lenght, but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs. The characters are uni-dimensional and have no other development in the story (theres actually no story either) than looking for each other and kissing. Its a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity, and achieving true emotional resonance. On top of that, it pretends to be an  art  film by using the worst naive clichés of the cinematic snobbery. But anyway, if someone can identify with its heavy banality, I guess thats fine.#0
10652_2#You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for The Safety Pin Killer! Thats right, in Killer Workout, a dumb slasher movie if Ive ever seen one, the unseen murderer dispatches his (or her?) victims with an oversized, novelty safety pin. It is an odd choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Naturally, the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing. #0
9611_3#There are so many goofy things about this movie that I cant possibly name but a few On a comedy level, or as high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, its viewer beware. Therefore, see this only if a) you must see every western out there b) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments appeal to you. Woah..#0
11357_3#1st the good news. The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and they dont go for the gotcha gimmicks. The film is based on the true story of the high point in human history, and even features one of the actual participants in that story Buzz Aldrin. Go rent  Apollo 13  and see a 9-rated movie about the REAL space program (RIP).#0
5227_10#The  Men in White  movie is definitely one of the funniest, if not THE funniest, comedy movies I ever watched! (and I watched quite a lot!) It is about two garbagemen, who become  Men in White  and then stop an invasion from space. It is also a parody of lots of classic movies, such as  Men in Black ,  Star Wars  or  Dr. Strangelove . Anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head. There are tons of funny gags and jokes here, and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you certainly wont regret it #1
8416_7#One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism, the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in Berlin. Classic movies like  Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari.  (1920) and  Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens  (1922) were the most famous direct results of this movement, and while the movement didnt have a long life, its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today, specially in the horror genre. One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener, director of 1920s  Der Golem, Wie Er in die Welt Kam , as in his debut as a filmmaker, seven years before the making of that classic, he was already making experiments with expressionism in film. That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally, another horror film  Der Student Von Prag . As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement, its hard to deny the enormous importance that  Der Student Von Prag  has in the history of German cinema, probably in the history of cinema in general. It may look dated even for its time, but considering the limited resources its director had, its truly better than most films from that era. As the movie that started Paul Wegeners career, and with that German expressionism,  Der Student Von Prag  is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history. 7/10#1
2264_9#Vonneguts words are best experienced on paper. The tales he weaves are gossemar, silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of Marilyn Manson or Jerry Bruckheimer explosions. His words have been treated well once before, in the remarkable Slaughterhouse-5. The film version deserves a 10, but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that I just cant do itsome of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory#1
373_4#Blank Check is a movie that I saw on TV one day and like most movies they air on TV Blank Check wasnt that good. First of all no one I have ever met has seen Blank Check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s. Also Blank Check wont be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixars films. I wouldnt call Blank Check a bad film but its not really entertaining either. (Or at least it isnt to anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check isnt a entertaining film because nothing about it is original. Everything just makes you go  what havent I seen this before?  Blank Check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (Which strangely enough both have Macaulay Culkin in it) Blank Check isnt a bad movie, but it deserves to fade into obscurity.#0
6173_1#This movie is a blatant attempt by the left in Hollywood to portray Reagans administration as incompetent and bungling. Some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis, but Im sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie. My first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong this time. There are apparently many others.#0
9110_3#I watched this movie at 3o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But still I think it wasnt good, this movie wasnt good at all. The reasons why are many. They should have handled the situations with more style and class, but they didnt, and therefore, this movie turned out bad#0
5180_2#that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there. I found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions, unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror. This was woeful#0
6804_1#This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie, A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet, thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps, HUH  Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds, when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!#0
3595_10#This movie has made me want to become a director, and Michelle Rodriguez is brilliant. How the hell wasnt she on mtvs top 25 under 25, she beats them all. This film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance, best film i have ever seen.#1
5236_10#This stylistically sophisticated visual game presents a story within a story. The protagonist is scriptwriter Bart Klever who fights persistently with his new text  which is, at the same time, the screenplay of the film were watching. In the movie Bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film Barts struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme, as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space, light, colours and a couple of cats. The outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmakers interventions, which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment. The constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise What is truth and what illusion ? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest? Can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space?#1
3945_4#My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. Its not that the movie is terrible, its just not what I was expecting or hoping for. While Ive been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, Im not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so Im coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any,  light  moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers. I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. Im convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it.#0
10785_1#Wow, what a great cast! Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Christopher Walken, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Hank Azariawhats that? A script, you say? Now youre just being greedy! Surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary? Youd think so, but no. Americas Sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another. Its like everyone involved woke up before each days writing/shooting/editing and though  You know what? Ive been working pretty hard lately, and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names, right? Im just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can.  So much potential, yet so painful to sit through. There isnt a single aspect of this thing that doesnt suck. Even Julias fat suit is lame.#0
9757_8#Richard Willaims is an animation god. He was hampered in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins  Greedy ). Joe Raposos repetitive music doesnt help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesnt show it in all its glory, lets hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still its worth watching for some eye popping animation.#1
336_1#Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds peaked, then started making dreadful Hal Needham car chase flicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling Last Action Hero. And here, loquacious Eddie Murphy erases memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this  family  adventure flick, which is an unbelievably tedious, childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see Charlotte Lewiss great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film. #0
181_2#Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 200 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70s to early 2000s. It was  Return To Cabin By The Lake  the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it. You have been warned.#0
137_7#After some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie, i was doubtful of giving it a go, but i had £3.99 in my wallet & thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie & saw this and gave it ago & Im glad i did, i enjoyed it. Directed by The star of films such as Chain Reaction, the Ring, Bourne Identity,(Brian Cox) i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it werent at all, i found some of the humour quite funny especially Alfred Molina the star of Spider-man 2 the Character Doc Ock. He was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film. Of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw Matthews name, and that made me get it! and no his part isnt big at all, its very short at the very end of the film, its not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film. I suggest you give it a go. Some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing, the acting, and a bit more action. But its watchable.#1
8511_1#I could not, for the life of me, follow, figure out or understand the story. As the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible. Im going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story/plot problem that never got sorted out. The producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from the other idea, which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killers pursuit by the police. They ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit. Too bad really because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography. In fact, a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours.#0
5954_7#I sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All well and good, and sure, not all perfectly done. However, I sense one crucial point about this film is being overlookedthe cultural significance of its location. The film is set in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying so. Thats a bold move in the film world today, and a rare treat for fans of indy films. And indeed, it may not be the last. Pensacola is world renowned as a Navy town, an aviation town, a lumber town, and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy. Rarely is it seen as a growing film town. But thats all changing now. More film companies are coming in to shoot. And more native Pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of a growing trend of Pensacola-based indy films, and more are on the way. Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community, and by and by, the world is taking more notice. Watch and listen, world. The Pensacolians are coming. Like a virus.#1
12343_2#Oh, brother. The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total  bomb  from me is because its at least historically noteworthy as the first Three Stooges film (when they werent yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy). But even as a longtime Stooges fan Id have to say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to Mr. Healys taller boss janitor. Theyre not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing. Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates Baron Munchausen (heres a good example of the level of humor  I object!   On what grounds?   Coffee grounds! ). His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even the schnoz himself is a bore.#0
1410_4#A still famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not filmed for four years. When he is invited to participate in a new project, he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket. He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he becomes attracted with her ability. His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor. But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time.

1498_2#Justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside, lets just take this movie as its offered, without extraneous explanations. Apparently this wasnt just random crap I found on the movie network late at night, apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through its production. How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God have mercy on us all.#0
5094_8#If you a purist, dont waste your time - otherwise, hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the Stewart Granger/Deborah Kerr version - Ive seen it dozens of times, but this film is every bit as good, only different. I wont detail the differences because it would spoil the film. Also, it is a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (Im a huge Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain, and the supporting cast is superb. I find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a Hallmark Production and this film was no exception. The cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you wont be disappointed.#1
1433_10#Brilliant execution in displaying once and for all, this time in the venue of politics, of how  good intentions do actually pave the road to hell . Excellent #1
10156_10#This great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5!Why not!It is a great portrayal of the life of Christ without the ruthless sensationalism of The Passion of The Christ.Johnny Cash did great things for God which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most,like our churches.The film itself took less than a month to film as Johnny felt the strong presence of God guiding him through it.Great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans.At least the Billy Graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new Christians.Thanks Fox for producing it.As Walk the Line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece.Movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves! In summary I believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright, honestly portrayed and a great witness to the Christian faith!#1
12009_10#I really thought they did an  excellent  job, there was nothing wrong with it at all, I dont know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible, it moved me to tears (I guess it moved about everyone to tears) but I try not to cry in a movie because its embarrassing but this one got me. It was SOOO good! I hope they release it on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that I cant explain, it made me want to strive to be a better person, they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted, I guess. Compared to that, I feel like our own trials are nothing. Well, not nothing, but they hardly match what they had to go through. I loved it. Who played Emma?!#1
2727_3#This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION doesnt really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. What she does do however, is shine when shes on screen. The near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some Warner contract players of the day. JANCIE RULE shows promise and its a shame she didnt become a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the  go-getter  with aplomb. Better if this was in color. The Travis Air force base locations with some rear projection work well. Whats best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. If you enjoyed THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN youll like this one.#0
4284_10#This movie is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the Balkans yet again, 45 years after the time depicted. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response. The accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types, however, make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex-Yugoslavia to its madness. In fact, no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie, and its twin,  Maratonci trce pocasni krug.  Did I mention it is one of the funniest movies Ive ever seen?#1
5067_10#Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Grey Owl is best character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I do not know if he had better nor worse roles, Im not his fan, but this one was really exceptional. And little bit more. I pay my respect to the original Grey Owl.#1
10713_9#An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as the Highland clearances, feature in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them. Its all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and its a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken. Im English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful. The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words, you are watching the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should go and see this film.#1
10459_2#Disjointed, unclear, bad screenplay, poor photography and directionall in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at TBN. TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring  China Cry , the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But  The Omega Code  is an unfortunate miscue. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved  China Cry , I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone. They do much good with their ministry, but this isnt an example of it. Dont waste your moneygo rent  China Cry  instead.#0
4990_1#I can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick, but this is just bad. And not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing MST3K make fun of it. Its just nauseatingly bad like you cant find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try. I truly regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this crap. You can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers. Apparently  Walking Tall  has garnered enough income that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment. If its not the worst film Ive seen, its so bad that its blotted the worse films from my memory.#0
3599_8#This movie is a real gem. The arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives completely believable. The dialogue is fresh, and oh so real. The situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed. Until the climax, that is. Then its as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable. But I dont want to discourage people from watching this film. The first 3/4s of it are truly remarkable. I gave it an 8. There are some remarkable performances here. Check out this movie.#1
5674_7#This time around, Blackadder is no longer royal(or even particularly close to being any such thing) instead, rather a butler to the Prince Regent, portrayed by Hugh Laurie(who replaces Tim McInnerny, who presence is sorely missed, and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was a bumbling and complete moron, we cant help but care for him, which isnt at all true of his replacement) as being intolerably daft(which he apparently was, according to the Trivia page), not to mention loud-mouthed and utterly non-threatening. Edmund can now do just about what he pleases, and does so. Why is he so frustrated and angry(honestly, it gets depressing at times)? Yes, his master is a buffoon, they always are. He doesnt seem to lack money, nor is he in any danger. In the second series, the Queen was mischievous and childish, and would cut off someones head - or marry them - on a whim. Here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting. There is still commentary and even a little satire. Too often, it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own, so they merely restate it, not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags. And I cant tell you how many of them I figured out before they were done, literally more than a minute away. Its not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered. Baldrick doesnt change from last season hes still rather pathetic and stupid, leading to  silly  humor. Frankly, the amount goes through the roof. Dont get me started on the gross-out stuff. The sarcastic, verbal wit can still be great, though much less of it is than before. Id say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny, while the other three didnt really get me into them at all. I was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were I could see many of such coming a mile away. Some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced. This continues with the tradition started by  II  of letting the plans work out occasionally. The theme is the worst of the bunch, the credits sequences the least creative. All in all, this is, by far, my least favorite of the four. I recommend it to fans of the franchise and of British comedy in general. 7/10#1
4562_9#Saw this film on DVD yesterday and was gob-smacked and flabbergasted. The unaffected acting of DDL just blew my mind, and I was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting. All of the character were so authentic to me, I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mom. Go and see it! Youll cry your heart out, but youll experience a wonderful catharsis! Besides, it teaches you one important lesson Determination is everything. You may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all. If you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self-pity. It wont get you anywhere and the only person wholl pity you will be yourself.#1
523_1#It is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today. maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties, and I am out of touch with todays movie going generation, and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie, since so many people loved it. I found it foul and vulgar. I havent said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and crude. I am not a politically correct person, and even I found the gay jokes, not only not funny but downright offensive ( Im not gay). The main character in the movie is not even a likable person, just pathetic. When the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see.#0
3219_10#This is a great movie. It has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action. This takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story. An awesome one man army action film for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action/sci-fi fans.#1
12216_4#Dont get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the movies but enough already re Death On The Nile. Everyone has done this one! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of Agatha Christies novels. I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb. The sets were terrific and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how awful he looked. I hope he doesnt look that way in real life! I honestly cant remember from other movies whether the very end was the same. Somehow I dont think so. I thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not Ms. Christie wrote it that way. I would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison!#0
1930_10#This film is hilarious, original, & beautifully directed. I have become a BIG BAD SWIM groupie, tracking it to film festivals whenever & wherever I can. Ive seen it about half a dozen times now, & each time, enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years. At nearly every festival it has screened, it has either sold out, or won the Audience Favorite award. Its clear that people love this film, & even clearer why they do. The cinematography is superb, the characterization & acting brilliant, the ending fantastic, & the direction filled with compassion, wisdom & the art of perfect timing. Its hard to believe this is Ishai Settons first film. I hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.#1
4606_7#Police Story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself.Compared to other action films,Police Story makes Schwarzenegger and Stallone look like beginners.The stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb.If New Line Cinema has any sense,they would release this in theaters.#1
5958_4#In the small American town of Meadowvale Dr. Anthony Blake (David Gale, the IMDb listing for this character is wrong its definitely Dr. Blake not Dr. Blakely) is the director and founder of the famed Psychological Research Institute and also hosts a local T.V. programme called Independent Thinkers. He uses this T.V. show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence. Dr. Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses its spinal cord as a tail thingy. Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank, eats mice and the odd bad actor, each time it eats someone it gets much bigger. Meanwhile at the local high-school gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski (Tom Bresnahan) has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets. Jim is sent to Dr. Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems. While there Dr. Blake hooks Jim up to, well something Im not actually sure what. This whatever it is, is attached to the brain. At first Jim is able to resist the brains mind control. The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and its plans. Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car. Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet (Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston) but is handed back to Dr. Blakes assistant Verna (George Buza) soon after by Officer Marks (Harry Booker). The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding its mind control techniques, and with Independent Thinkers going national the brain doesnt want anything or anyone to stop its evil plan for world domination! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain, before it takes over the world! Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here, the Brain wasnt as bad as I thought it was going to be. Dont get me wrong as it certainly isnt great either. The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T.V. storyline. It moves along at a fair pace and isnt too boring. No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all, its just there and thats it we have to accept it. The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element, theres the T.V. mind control, the brain itself, Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr. Blake that isnt explained at all. Production wise this film looks cheap, and probably was cheap. The acting isnt great but Ive seen worse, and what is David Gale doing in this? In fact this role is similar to Gales role in Re-Animator (1985) even down to his characters deaths in both films. The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big. Each stage is just made of rubber. It doesnt look particularly good and isnt scary or creepy, just cheap. Theres no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and youll miss it decapitation. The nudity is provided by Dr. Blakes assistant Vivian (Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack) before she gets eaten. The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it. Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on T.V. for free.#0
6681_10#This movie deserved better Its great fun, has some wonderful jokes and sight gags, some in-stuff for the  Geeks  amongst us (And we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effectual. Watching Paul Reubens fart in the face of an Academy Award winner is worth the price of admission alone. I never read the comics series before I saw the movie, but have since. as good as they are, I still recommend MM the film. (Although having the Flaming Carrot as a character would have been cool, too) Greg Kinnear is, well,amazing as Captain Amazing, and NO ONE ELSE could be The Shoveller except William H. Macy My favorite line in the film?  Weve got a blind date with Destiny. And it looks like shes ordered the lobster.  See this film. BUY this film! Its only 5 bucks and some change at your local Wal-Mart. Youll thank me. Really you will. Oh, and Ms. Garafolo is in it. THAT ALONE makes it watch-worthy#1
3613_8#When  Girlfight  came out, the reviews praised it, but I didnt get around to seeing it. I finally saw it when it got released on video, and understand the glowing reviews. All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself/herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years ( Rocky ,  Million Dollar Baby ), but I still think that they did a great job with it here. In fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. Really good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one.#1
3787_1#I must be that one guy in America that didnt like this movie. I guess this just wasnt my style or something, I just dont see whats so fascinating about it, this was  barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history.  Its about a guy that came from nothing, and goes on to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and thats exactly my feeling about the entire movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias/drug trade/criminal groups doesnt automatically make it a great movie, dont forget good storytelling.#0
6031_3#Its been a while since seeing this the first time, so I watched it again with the second movie in the series. While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I havent seen yet, Ill review under the original title Thus, the  Left Behind  movies fail because the  Left Behind  books arent worthy to be interpreted into movies.#0
10796_9#If youre a a fan of either or both Chuck Norris & Judson Mills then this is the movie to see.It has a lot of adventure in it.It is a great follow up to Presidents Man.The chemistry between the main three stars(Chuck Norris,Judson Mills,Jennifer Tung)is incredible.My personal opinion.This movie along with the original,has turned out so well,that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series.If youve seen Presidents Man,i recommend this movie for you.If youve seen Presidents ManA Line In The Sand but you havent seen Presidents Man,then let me suggest that you do.You will not be disappointed with either one.#1
224_4#The worst thing about Crush is not that its acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and its not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better. #0
8007_7#This game is very addictive, I kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you cant save a game when you are in space contributed to this, at times I just HAD to play on in order not to loose any game data. 7/10#1
5786_2#When you look at this now and hear all the language in here, its amazing this was rated  PG,  but thats the 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk spews out the Lords name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! Yet, few people consider that offensive, and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who  rate  them. I like heist movies, and a lot of films by director William Friedkin, but this script doesnt deliver and it just has way too much of the  Sleazy 70s  feel to it, visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in TVs  Columbo  it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films. This is far from the only case.#0
11075_2#Once upon a time there was a science fiction author named H. Beam Piper who wrote a classic book named  Little Fuzzy  which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of todays authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold. This is the book where they got the idea for Ewoks from. But dont take my word for it. Heres a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of  Little Fuzzy  for free http www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137#0
12401_4#I am at a distinct disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two movies in this series, although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films. Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. Judging it on its own, it was pretty boring. The ending with the car chase with ZDar, Caitlin Dulany, and Robert Davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie.#0
11501_2#A romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class  artist  with a comfortable upbringing It is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks, boyish jokes. They do never look for work, the do almost never experience rejection or anguish, etc. Living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school Ridiculous. Specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of Ken Loach, etc.#0
5500_10#This Documentary (Now available free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone must see this. But the poor of Venezuela didnt believe the media. They went to the Palace in their millions and demanded that Chavez be returned. In the face of such overwhelming numbers, the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the US. Chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation.#1
6103_2#To be honest, im surprised by the positive votes that this film has received. The movie just drags along its 81 minute life span, and the audience has to suffer the whole way through. Actually there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well. Scott Valentine(Merrideths boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough watch. I guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies.give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day(to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in  Bloodstorm Subspecies 4 ). The movie moves so slow and is only positively punctuated by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradlings dance scenes. This movie can honestly only be recommended to the die hard fans of Charlie Spradling (which i am, and i still had a rough time watching it!).#0
1374_8#A French film Ester Williams would love. But the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a Paris exurbia finding themselves. No question where Sciammas sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as  animaux  but actually only the 3 girls are in focus, and for the entire time, with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background. Marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on Floriane ( a Renascence quality beauty per one reviewer) and she is also a friend of convenience to Anna not unattractive, but for her, the time of her bodys perfection was short, and now she is an adolescent in a womens body. What ensues is a journey to self-realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un-natural where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth? While the dénouement was breath taking, with Florianes self-absorption beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, it all seemed abstract, Sciammas puppets.#1
5734_1#This is the kind of movie thats so extremely bad that you cant stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that it cannot continue to be this crappy all the way to the end. It just cant. You know, worse than Jaws 4-kind of bad. If youre hoping for a mix between Ichi the Killer and August Underground keep looking. You wont find it in Live Feed.#0
10672_9#Anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly, I would refer them to Roger Eberts review of this movie. He is one of the most respected Critics in the industry, and he gave it 3 1/2 Stars. This is a great musical. It has its slow points, and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines, but all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Take a closer look at the movie, and then maybe you will understand what I am talking about.#1
4627_1#Cheap, amateurish, unimaginative, exploitative but dont think itll have redeeming amusement value. About as unentertaining, uninstructive and just plain dull as a film can be.#0
1334_4#So I finally saw the film  My Left Foot  last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is The central performance of Day-Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less. So yes; just because youve overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesnt make you any less of a jerk Being a good person takes priority; setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list.#0
9764_1#In one word abysmal. I give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Cormans worst effort, bar none. Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast. I cannot believe that this is now going to be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with  Wild In The Streets  - another retro stinker. I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some, scanned the digital channels the premise looked interesting enough because I like viewing B-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks. It seemed familiar somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought why not? What a big mistake it was a horrible start to my day. Ted in Gilbert, AZ#0
10439_1#Id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot(!) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie Ive ever seen! I cant believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.#0
9254_7#no movie with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here. This is a poor mans version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye Ms.Eleniak. Tom Berenger plays another gruff, maverick military type well and William Mcnamara plays his rookie-about to be discharged foil well. The plot on the face of it is absurd because I lost count of the times Eleniak should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel-good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling. This isnt really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time.#1
10056_8#We watched this in my Womens Health Issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and I absolutely loved this movie. I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is a movie I will show to my children. The professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women, but this movie was more than that. It is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite.#1
1129_1#Ive seen this film because I had do (my job includes seeing movies of all kinds). I couldnt stop thinking  who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to Cannes Festival!  It wasnt only boring, the actors were awful as well. It was one of the worst movies Ive ever seen.#0
3257_1#After having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was Is this supposed to be irony or not? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this film was not meant to be ironic. So, the story tells us about an US-American Super-Doc saving a south American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen. The film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example.#0
4906_9#I dont believe this was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. This was an uncomplicated plot, yet interesting. It is a good movie to watch when you dont want to do a lot of thinking, just want to be told a simple story. The Canadian scenery was breathtaking. The beautiful Fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing.#1
6999_3#This film is pure Hollywood hokum. It is based upon a novel called Not Too Narrow  Not Too Deep by Richard Sale, which may or may not have been interesting; it would take research to find out! The story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film, so either the film was savagely cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start. There is not one millisecond in this film which is remotely realistic, either in terms of events or characters. It is pure Hollywood fantasy in every respect. Two well-known actors, Paul Lukas and Peter Lorre, are so under-used and wasted that there was no point in their being in the film at all. They must have been thrown into the mix in the manner in which one adds a sprinkling of chopped chives to an omelette, hoping that the flavour will be enhanced. The film is a ponderous attempt at producing a morality tale, and is so corny that it is laughable. The story concerns some hardened criminals imprisoned in French Guiana who want to escape from their French colonial prison through a jungle (very much a Hollywood set jungle, with a rubber snake). Naturally there has to be a woman in the story, so Joan Crawford hams it up as a down-on-her-luck tramp who for some reason becomes irresistible to Clark Gable, one of the escaped criminals. Crawford in escaping through the jungle wears high-heeled shoes and keeps her makeup fresh. Gable flirts and grimaces and makes mawkish expressions, crinkling his brow as was his wont, smirking and looking suggestively at everybody, which was his manner of acting. It is hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal when he is always trying so hard to be Clark Gable that surely he hasnt any time left to be a thief. (Attention-seekers are by definition too busy to steal and unsuited to a task which requires that people NOT see them.) The whole escapade is so ridiculous that it can only be regarded as light entertainment. An attempt at religiosity and depth is made by injecting into the story a mysterious angel of mercy who voluntarily walks into the prison and pretends to be an inmate. He helps in the escape and accompanies all the criminals and ministers to their various deaths, helping them to find peace in their last gasps. This character is played very well by Ian Hunter, who retains throughout a convincing air of secret knowledge, smiles enigmatically, makes cryptic prophetic remarks, and has a small spot trained on his face to give him a heavenly glow. The theme is meant to be redemption. You might call it the Donald Duck version of Hollywood Goes Moral and Gets Heavy. For real depth, Hitchcocks I Confess of 1953 shows how it should really be done. By contrast, this piece of trivial nonsense shows just how bare the cupboards of Meaning were in Tinsel Town, and that when they went rummaging for something that might mean something, all they could come up with was, you guessed it, more tinsel.#0
4150_2#Oh it really really is. Ive seen films that I disliked more, due to whatever reason, but never have I seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making. It even fails to fail at film making, in a Way the Hercules in New York could be said to do. Its not the film I like the least, but it is the very worst film Ive ever seen. So in the end, this is not a film so bad its good, or so bad its in any way enjoyable, even drunk. Its just a mess, and worth no-ones time watching.#0
4458_7#This has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot. It is another sailors on leave film, zippier than Astaires Follow the Fleet but not as good as On The Town.  Very pleasant then but a bit too long. A taster of better musicals to come.#1
10430_9#I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. Having saw it twice, I couldnt help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesnt believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But, I didnt rate it as a  great film , it still seemed to me like another thinking persons feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel thats more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities didnt strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies Ive seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaterss own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. I dont know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celines first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile Ive seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I dont know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. Im sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.#1
4144_1#Vampires Vs. Zombies starts with the breaking news that the unidentified disease that is spreading across America leaves the sufferer with homicidal & cannibalistic tendencies Travis Fontaine (C.S. Munro) & his teenage daughter Jenna (Bonny Giroux) listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try & escape the disease when Travis runs over a guy who I assume is meant to be a zombie. Slightly further down the road he stops to help Julia (Brinke Stevens) & her teenage daughter Carmilla (Maratama Carlson) who are waving at the side of the road, at this point there is also a third teenage girl named Tessa (Melanie Crystal) sitting in the back of Julias car bound & gagged. To me this situation would seem strange but Travis, like the trooper he is, takes it all in his stride & agrees to take Carmilla off Julias hands &, well I dont know actually. So, with a complete stranger, Travis drives off leaving Julia & Tessa. Carmilla seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a Vampire & she likes to bite people & turn them into Vampires, oh & shes partial to a bit of lesbianism too. Travis, Carmilla & Jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself The General (Peter Ruginis) who appears to be some sort of Vampire killer & probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it doesnt really matter & I really dont know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it There isnt much else left to say, Vampires Vs. Zombies is easily one of the worst films ever made. The (V) next to the title on the IMDbs main page for Vampires Vs. Zoimbies indicates that it went straight to video, well thats far too good for this pile of crap as it deserves to go straight on the nearest fire.#0
11928_8#This movie, while seemingly based off of a movie of the same title in 1951 released by MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still a great film. Danny Glover in one of his best performances brings George Knox, a down on his luck baseball manager with a short temper, to life. As for this movie being  stacked , how about adding Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience works and shows through in his performances on screen, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock from the Sun), Brenda Fricker (a charming and well seasoned Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes even he is good in this film), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be as pivotal in this film, but he got exposure), Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey goes the same for Adrien, except the Dazed and Confused part), some great character actors like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, the owner of the California Angels), and the rest of the cast does a great job, plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone, I dont care what recesses of depression youre in. I loved this film as a kid, and it brings back memories when I watch it today. I need this on DVD. I recommend it to any parent whos looking for something their kids have not seen, and everybody else, for that matter.#1
10891_1#I saw the trailer to this film and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, the acting is a shambles, the special effects (if you could call them that), look like something that wouldnt be out of place at a school play. Some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen, which unfortunately is all to often. As for a story, forget it. This is a warning, dont waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things I have ever seen. If, for some reason, you like this film watch Troll 2, you will probably enjoy that as well.#0
311_9#I thought Rachel York was fantastic as  Lucy.  I have seen her in  Kiss Me, Kate  and  Victor/Victoria,  as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. She is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything! I believe that Rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon. And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing.  Lucy  was a star turn for Rachel York. I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. I also hope it brings her an Emmy.#1
12467_1#This movie was slower then Molasses in January in Alaska. The man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview. I had to wake up the people I was watching it with, several times. After it was over, I felt bad for having woken them up.  I was brought in expecting the excitement of 24. I got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman.#0
236_9#It is a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again.  The Amati Girls  is such a movie. In old time movie theaters I would have stayed put for more showings. Was this story autobiographical for the writer/director? It has the aura of reality. It is no coincidence that the family name, Amati, translated from the Italian means the loved ones.#1
8241_2#This movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school. I have to give it credit on its campiness though. Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically. It was so bad at times that it was comical, which made it a fun watch. I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there.#0
1351_1# The Bubble  is an effort to make a gay Romeo & Juliet type of story with an Israeli and a Palestinian, although it seems to come at it by way of  Friends  or  Beverly Hills 90210.  The characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line. The movie seems torn between fluff and depth. On the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as (in one example of many) some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand, and get answers like,  Hey, were here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation. Dont get political!  Beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line, its just one of many ham-fisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests. On the other hand, the movies main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of  Bent  a play about gays in a Nazi labor camp. The scene on stage is awkwardly rushed, undermining its erotic power (understandable given the constraints of film-time, but still this could have been edited to much better effect.) and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film. Too bad. This play deserves much better. Gloriously bad films  like the works of Ed Wood -- at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them. This one doesnt even have that going for it. Most of the sound track sounds like Simon and Garfunkel on quaaludes, and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes, the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre TV-movie-of-the-week.#0
9618_4#I have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like Friday the 13th/I Know What You Did Last Summer, this movie wasnt that bad. In fact it wasnt as bad as most of the Horror films Hollywood has released recently. The killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that, original. The cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low-budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio Artisan/Lions Gate has been offering. My only real complaint that wasnt due to the films budget, which must have been small, was the contrived  twist  ending. Im sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me. The ending was just stupid and tacked on. Before that I was a little bored, but actually enjoying it. 4/10#0
6419_10#This film is an excellent military movie. It may not be an excellent Hollywood Movie, but that does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but that is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste, but  as a retired Soldier  I appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted. The story itself has been told and retold several times over, but it remains for a professional soldier  and an African American at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew, and as it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashears work to become a Navy Diver, and his life as a Navy Diver beyond his graduation, is not the only story that is presented. There I also the story of how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday defied the illegal order of his Commanding Officer that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did, and paid the price of a loss of one Stripe and a change of assignment. It also told the true story how Brashear found the third Hydrogen Bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if Brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself. This was a complex story that was worth telling, and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story, and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner, and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner.#1
8223_1#Definitely, definitely the worst film Ive ever seen, no questions asked! Contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, since its an independent, low-budget film, but cmon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying. oh and by the way, this movie is NOTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand-held camera  this is an effect and not a trait! Used cleverly it can be breathtaking, but in this case its an excuse for inadequate cinematography.#0
4352_10#I was looking through the movie listings in my area on yahoo and seen a movie that had not been advertised. I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it. Having watched  Mad about you , once, I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. However, I am a big fan of Peter Falk. So the spouse and I took a chance. We were both swept into this story. The beautiful scenery, the heartfelt acting and the sense of family and moral values that are seldom seen in movies and the world today. Not that sappy emoted junk, but real life situations from real life-like people. I even have to say, Paul Reiser was excellent, although, I still wont watch  Mad about you . I dont know where this movie has gone. I heard it was put out in limited release. It should be shared with the world. It is one of the finest movies I have seen. M.#1
11627_8#Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to Miami. She ends up sitting next to an assassin named Jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies. The reason she has to switch the room is because Jackson wants to blow it up. I especially liked the ending because it was heart-stopping. I didnt know what was going to happen and I was surprised by it. For me, this movie just took off.#1
5128_9#First let me say I am not from the south but I am an American. I dont love Country music but I can stomach it. I would never wear a cowboy hat but I wear hats. I dont live in a trailer but I do eat tuna salad and own a home. What does that have to do with this comment? A lot if you are one of those people who say only  country  people love this movie. This movie is loosely based on the  They loved and lost  premise. James Bridges directs an American love story as real as it gets. In an era of Jerry Springer and  Lets put it out there  mentality, this film rings truer than ever.  If you can watch this for what it is, a true American love story. Then I recommend that you take it for what it isa film before its time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. If this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more. Lastly, the music however dated, is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age.#1
9405_10#While Hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after WWII, England developed a very prolific film industry. In  The Man in the White Suit , inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business! How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity? This is an example of one of the great movies in which Alec Guinness starred before he became Obi Wan Kenobi. Its a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world. If youre planning to start any kind of business, you might want to consider watching this movie.#1
8123_1#(spoilers)Wow, this is a bad one. I did a double take when watching an old Star Trek episode the other day-it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts-and there was Stewart Moss, a.k.a the unlikable hero of It Lives by Night! He played the first crewmember infected, who dies from terminal depression. All I could think was that hed watched his own movie too many times, thats what caused the depression. This movie is full of truly unlikable people. There is no redeeming character in the film, not one. Its very hard to feel bad about Dr. Becks turning into a bat(or whatever he actually turned into), because you just dont like him. And you dont like his shrill, bony wife, or the nasty sleazy Sgt. Ward, or Dr. Mustache LoveSo why would you invest any time or energy in this movie? Where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to bother caring about it. Not to mention the horrible cinematography, which made it look like theyd filmed the movie through urine, and the five cent bat special effects, many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying. Not the worst film Ive ever seen on MST3K, but down there in the bottom ranks, definitely.#0
1569_10#I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon, and Waffle are cats so different from each other, yet they refer to themselves collectively as brothers. I often find myself trying to imitate the tired, sighing accent of their butler, Hovis, or even the Scottish borough of Gordon. There should be more episodes made about Human Kimberly. The episode about the cats disguising themselves as pre-teen girls to gain admittance to Human Kimberlys slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. We cant drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the Catscratch voices or the Hanson Brothers from the movie Slap Shot. Future classic. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD??#1
2681_3#A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the ending to this film? #0
1780_10#My mother and I were on our way home from a trip up to the North East (mainly Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in Boston. Now, I dont know much about film so I thought this might be a bit educational. The first movie we saw was this one, THE ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I dont know about you but I thought this was great! Im from Texas and where I come from we dont see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted that it was too violent, but said that I didnt know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture. I was shocked by the fight sequences they were great. Also, I am a big fan when the good guys win so I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys. This was true brilliance. Im not sure when its getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out. I think youll be pleasantly surprised. A word to the wise though, it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch. Its more for adults.#1
2652_1#I cant believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and I feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs. When one of the main characters announces that hes gay twice in the first five minutes, dont ignore it as typical PC nonsense and figure it has to get better because it wont. If his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesnt make you sick, then be thankful the freak who wrote and/or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint. I mean, get real. Its one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flicks supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of  closure  over the sudden death of her daughter. What does one thing have to do with the other, one might be tempted to ask? Apparently, the two issues are inextricably interwoven. And if that werent bad enough, theres the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor. I mean, seriously, hasnt that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis? Why must she go around like that? At the very least, how about shaving the ugly thing off, and while youre at it, have those horrible moles removed, too. Would YOU slurp up some ice cream she just served you? I think not. It must be a New Jersey thing.  Youd think Diane Keaton might save this piece of drek, but think again. Was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse? I dont even wanna think about it. So what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter. This grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and thats all there is to it. One wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going. None of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant. Trust me -- pass this piece of crap up. Its not about death, a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter, or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it. Its a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director.#0
7478_2#When I saw previews of this movie I thought that it may be dumb, but it will at least be funny. Well I was wrong. Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But by the end, I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next. Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.#0
10572_1#   SLIGHT SPOILERS    Once the young father is a parent, he has found happiness. He insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper. We see the 15-year-old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teens busy=body mother is peaking over his shoulder. Fade to black.#0
10124_8#Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber-conventional realm. Its a yakuza/triad picture, involving cops versus Japanese &/or Chinese gangsters (mostly Chinese, as the title suggests), but already even in his first technical debut, Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here-on in. Social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and ones roots, which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2; thumbing-of-the-nose at taboos like gay sex and (satirical) rape/violence towards women; blood-curdling violence. Its certainly not as surreal as some of Miikes most recent films, but this is expected as hes trying out things that hes just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers. Its got all of those qualities, and its also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy (in spots) and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans. As the first entry of the  Black Society  trilogy, as its called, I was quite impressed, and its a fine quasi-calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.#1
6971_10#Of course the average  Sci-Fi  Battle Star Gallactica fan will hate this. That kind of makes me happy. I dont like those cheesy sci-fi shows especially Battle-star Gallactica and that is why I like this show. What I love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great Anime! From young teens running around shooting guns, to and extremely well balanced and complex script, to robots it reminds me of something that came from Japan except a little bit better (most Anime is too confusing).#1
556_1#In my book  Basic Instinct  was a perfect film. It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role. It had marvelous photography, music and the noirest noir script ever. All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get! I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made! It does damage to the original, so bad is it. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body applies to film-making, too. There should be a law Dont ever make a sequel to a perfect film #0
9820_10#This is a very good, made for TV film. It depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970s and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around. The worst & most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog. The teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family. But boy!, does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end. The father/homeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is. He stands up to them and protects his home and his family. A very good actor..I might add. It is definitely worth seeing!#1
3903_10#Stumbling upon this HBO special late one night, I was absolutely taken by this attractive British  executive transvestite.

11396_2#The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that doesnt go straight to the Playboy Channel.  The Hazing  borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable just barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper-thin and the actors couldnt act their way out of a grocery bag. Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. Sometimes, when Im bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is a lot like that. Chew on it for 90 minutes and youre left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.#0
11691_8#Great movie when I saw it. Have to say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. As I got older and saw it again I realized that the movie is average. Compared to movies that are known ad good comedys, this is nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great. Also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking. Its like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch. I like the movie overall so i give it a Still a good 7/10 for me.#1
4008_9#Its hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as Notting Hill pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this, but well, heres the evidence and its quite compelling. Several have alluded to TV drama, and yes, this does have a seventies Play for Today feel at times, but is always a cut above, mainly I think owing to some quite superlative acting from Anne Reid and to a fine script which shadow-boxes with cliché without ever getting one on the nose, except maybe right at the end. (I didnt like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway, nor the oh-what-a-beautiful-morning final scene she deserved a more studied finale than that I think, after all that hard work. The slippers business was a bit OTT too, on reflection). And of course I was, as everyone probably was, dumbfounded by what Anne Reid does with her character and with her body. Shes /not/  the repressed, dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time , this is far too simplistic for the character we have. Again and again there are allusions to her having been a  bad housewife , not to mention that thing she does with trays, trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward. The daughter accuses her of having  sat in front of the TV all day  instead of, well, whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been she has no answer. She never was a model wife and mother, at least not to herself - thats where a lot of the poignancy comes from, the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply wasnt good at, ever.#1
4928_3#This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. A wealthy upper class English woman schemes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind. Theres a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters. But naturally theres a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man. The wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that.#0
1771_10#A classic series that should be at least repeated or released on DVD.Billy Toth,after realising he is adopted after the death of his parents,embarks on a journey to find his real parents.After various rites of passage,his search culminates in the discovery that his fathers identity was stolen and used by a human trafficker in Europe!If i remember correctly,the series ends on the Austrian(?] ski slopes and a cliff top chase resulting in the death of Billys fathers betrayer. This series was all filmed on location in various destinations round Europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes crossing into the realms of film noir and crime thriller.The main arc was often eclipsed by the slices of life that Billy went through during his years of toiling to find his mother and fathers secrets.A class act but underrated and forgotten.#1
9026_9#In my opinion, October Sky is one of the best movies of 1999It totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need, like, wonderful story and good character interactions. October Sky will remain in heart for as long as I can remember, and I just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film.#1
227_1#Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. But by now its too late. Its hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop, because Id never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).#0
3258_2#DOC SAVAGE THE MAN OF BRONZE (1 outta 5 stars) Dreadful, dreadful movie based on the pulp magazine/paperback series by Lester Dent/Kenneth Robeson about a super-heroic adventure hero in the 30s and his five assistants, all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil. It was a pretty hokey series but kinda fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a movie version in the 70s, starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely but I never got a chance to see it. It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I have finally seen the film I can understand why. The plot and characters are never treated seriously its all kind of tongue-in-cheek and campy kind of like the old Batman TV series only without the benefit of being funny or having any visual flair. Corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, dumb stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting. Actually, I find it kind of fascinating in its badness what could they have possibly been thinking? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern-day remake but I dont imagine that would have turned out to be much better.#0
3821_9#Secret Sunshine (2007) is famous for its awards at the Festival de Cannes in 2007 and other film festivals. Jeon-Do Yeon, who played the newly widowed Shin-ae, won the best actress trophy at the 60th Cannes festival. Secret Sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and Jeon-Do Yeon received a best actress nod from Asia Pacific Screen Awards. In addition, this movie won the best film awards in virtually all Korean film festivals. Masterfully written and directed, and uniquely photographed, Secret Sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy. This film also talked about the forgiveness of God and people. Lee Chang Dong, director and writer of this movie, said in an interview,  In a vast sense, I wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense. Without love, we cant talk about hope and salvation.  Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent genre. This movie is not a movie about religion, but it drew attention from many Christians in Korea because there were a lot of Christian elements in the movie. Secret Sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in Korea. It is like Da Vinci Code. While Da Vinci Code helps us discuss the early church history, Secret Sunshine prompts us to deal with lifes messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable. With a shallow interpretation of the movie, people misunderstand Christianity and its theology. With a deeper interpretation, this movie will help us see beneath the surface. Some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched Secret Sunshine, and Lee Chang-dong responds by saying,  They were already anti-Christ before they watched this movie. Secret Sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through Shin-aes life.#1
9321_8#As romantic comedies go, this was a cute and winning one. I thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better, but that is not a huge tripping point. But, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads. I hope to see them cast in more projects soon. Overall, this movie wont change your life, but is is sweet, warm and winning. Not a bad thing to be at all.#1

7793_10#My brother brought this movie home from the rental store and I remember expecting it to be such a bore. I think the title especially put me off. I cant ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over. I watched the movie twice before I let my brother take it back to the store. It is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did. I was completely caught up in Rubys situation as she tries to make her way through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I could have kept watching for hours. Another downside is that I have been unsatisfied with everything Ashley Judd has done since. She is so perfect in this movie. This film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time.#1

10818_1#Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Brontes work, and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours, the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional, thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding. There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their love is superficial. This is such an injustice to Brontes novel;you are given no impression of Janes quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance which attracts Jane to him. Despite to poor scripting, I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, however overall the production was poor. Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful. See  Jane Eyre  (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.#0

4206_9#Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train. What he doesnt realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm, microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations. Its a B movie in texture but an A film in execution, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10#1
9204_10#The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anands mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujaris posters. But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Devs mind to be made into a film. Overall it is a good film.#1
8919_7#Who would think Andy Griffiths  Helen Crump  (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past? But that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie, which might best be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God Knows What From Outer Space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would shortly decide that  Steve  sounded less prissy), a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders, but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous, man-eating What Is It that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left. But will the grown ups believe them? Of course not, what do they know, theyre just kids! The movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best. The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously, with many a soulful look into each other eyes, and the  adult  supporting cast probably says  Kids!  very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film its creature, which is well imagined, well-executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. And although clearly on the cheap side (check out those miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a fairly well-made film--and theres that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure. The 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but that wont prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility, and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated  grown ups only  get together. Make plenty of Jello cubes for movie snacking! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer#1
2770_8#Watching David&Bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to Sunday school. Despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining. The studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for. Peck portrays King David as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.#1
5620_10#Roman Polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time, as the mind behind classics such as  Rosemarys Baby  and  Chinatown . Probably what makes Polanskis cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces, he is also fond of making low-key movies that are of a more personal nature.  Le Locataire , or  The Tenant , is one of those movies; a horror/suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done. While  The Tenant  may not be for everyone, those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience.  Le Locataire  is really one of Roman Polanksis masterpieces. 10/10#1
1903_10#Ok, even if you cant stand Liza- this movie is truly hilarious! The scenes with John Gielgud make up for Liza. One of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century. Dudley Moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch! The one-liners are the best.#1
564_1#The producers made a big mistake casting Mark Lester, who couldnt act or sing, in the title role. Aside from his very bad  acting , all of Lesters singing had to be dubbed by a girl. I dont know why they cast him at all, since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well. Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy, who was only supposed to be 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Jack Wild ever was. It was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.#0
5251_7#well  Waynes World  is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off-shoot movies. from such cinematic offal as  Its Pat  to the recent 80 minute yawn,  A Night at the Roxbury,  many have, no doubt, lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen. well fear not because Tim Meadows comes through in spades. the well-written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the Leon Phelps character introduced in the five minute skit, the storyline allows the character to develop. the humor (consisting largely of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory. its a just great time if you dont feel like taking yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of  Saved by the Bell  fame, makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible. finally Billy Dee Williams, reliving his Colt 45 days, gives the movie a touch of class. and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself, you will find this movie to be eminently quotable,  ooh, its a lady!  #1
11673_8#Having seen Charley Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see how Charley would be in his own show. I thought Charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth. Its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness, it just shows their human too! I dont know a lot about bikes, but this show gripped me right from the start. The preparation and organising for this event seems immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and Im fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets. I love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music. I cant believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope its not the end, I cant wait to see the next episode#1
3012_8#This is one of those movies that you wish you hadnt seen before - so you could see it again   for the first time   . Van Dines books still bring pleasure - but are termed excessively flowery by many . This movie is by far the best film adaptation of his works . William Powell is William Powell - say no more . The plot is intricate . The story moves all too quickly , because you want it to last . Enjoy.#1
7157_7#This film is an entertaining, fun and quality film. The film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book, and tries to stick to the exact lines. The actors are all suitable, and you would expect them to be the part. They use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film. The graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film. There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard, for example. The camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book, and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book. All of his group are mentioned a lot in the book, but are not in the film. Overall, a great film for a rainy afternoon#1
6198_7#Im one of those people whod crawl a mile through broken glass to see a Hal Hartley film. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my Hartley favorite) NO SUCH THING, Hals unique brand of movies are an acquired taste. Infusing equal parts mystery/espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte. The comedy isnt in your face necessarily, and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to fruition. And thats the case with FAY GRIM, the sequel to Henry Fool. Even so, fans will probably devour Fay Grim and beg for more. Though this wasnt my favorite Hal Hartley film, I know Im ready.#1
6212_1#It used to be my thinking that movies required plots, or some other means of making you care at all about the story line or anything that is going on. This movie has showed me that you dont actually have to have anything like that. If you are looking to entertain yourself, then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up. It would be a far better use of your time. Time that you will never get back. Jurassic Park 3 was pulled off better than this movie.#0
12010_10#Warning mild spoilers. The film is beautifully shot, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. That the events portrayed actually happened in these United States of America is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.#1
7418_8# Shower  is an story about loyalty, about the unstoppable advance of modern world in the detriment of rather traditional and more human ways of life. A man forced to choose between his successful career in business, his big-city life, his wife, and his retarded young brother. The eternal doubt between what we WANT to do and what we SHOULD do. The modern China versus the ancient one. The public baths with its gatherings, its cricket fights versus the shopping centres and the skyscraper. Lots of old men and women that are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said  though one of them is killing the other.  My rate 8/10#1
11092_8#52-Pick Up never got the respect it should have. It works on many levels, and has a complicated but followable plot. The actors involved give some of their finest performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider, and John Glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals. Notable too are Vanity, who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows, and Kelly Preston, whos character will haunt you for a few days. Anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this.#1
8157_4#Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II starts at the Hamilton High School prom of 1957 where Mary Lou Maloney (Lisa Schrage) is cheating on her date Bill Nordham (Steve Atkinson) with Bud Cooper (Robert Lewis). Bill finds out & is devastated, meanwhile Mary Lou is announced prom queen 1957 & takes to the stage to accept her award. Bill, still hurting, decides to play a practical joke on Mary Lou so he throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches Mary Lous dress setting it & her on fire, within seconds Mary Lou is toast. 30 years later & Hamilton High is soon to hold its annual prom night. Bill (Micheal Ironside) is now the principal & has a teenage son named Craig (Justin Louis) who is dating Vicki Carpenter (Wendy Lyon) & are both planning on going to the prom together. Bud (Richard Monette) is now a priest, that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both Bill & Bud. One day Vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens, this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of Mary Lou is set free & is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen & in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death. First up is Jess Browning (Beth Gondek) whose death is put down to a suicide, Mary Lou begins to posses Vickis body as the night of the prom draws nearer. After disposing of some competition in the shape of Kelly Hennenlotter (Terri Hawkes) who tries to fix the prom so she wins. Mary Lou in Vickis body is crowned Hamilton High prom queen which allows Mary Lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance & really liven the party up With absolutely no connection to the original Prom Night (1980) & directed by Bruce Pittman I thought Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II wasnt a particularly good film. The script by Ron Oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes, whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations I suppose. Personally I found these different elements didnt really gel or work that well together at all. The whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable, after the opening sequence where Mary Lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark & then the film plods along for another half an hour until Vicki is finally possessed & the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil Mary Lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated, come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd killer not dead & ready for a sequel ending didnt you? Dont expect a hight body count, just five throughout the entire film & none particularly graphic although I did like the way Monica (Beverley Hendry as Beverly Hendry) tried to hide in a shower room locker which Mary Lou crushed & resulting in poor Monicas blood oozing out. The supernatural side of Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II is depicted by Vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour & Mary Lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life, the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water & zombie hands drag Vicki into it. The slasher side of Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II isnt outstanding, I did like Mary Lou herself as she churns out the obligatory one-liners & she made for a good villain even if she didnt get to kill enough people. Oh, & yes I did get the running homages to various other horror film directors with almost all of the characters sharing last names with one, this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch I suppose. The acting is OK but the normally dependable Micheal Ironside looks lost & uninterested almost as if hes asking himself what hes doing in this & if hell ever work again. Forget about any gore, someone is hanged, there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen, someone is impaled with a neon light, a computer goes crazy & electrocutes someones face(!?) & Mary Lou bursts out of Vickis body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene. There are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well, if thats your thing. To give it some credit Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II is OK to watch, has reasonable production values throughout & is generally well made. Overall I was disappointed by Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II, it was just too slow & ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes. Im not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating, Ill give it a 4 as theres nothing specifically wrong with it I suppose & Ive sat through much worse films but it just didnt really do anything for me Im afraid.#0
3318_3#How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her too bad shes completely out role. I havent read the book by Jane Austen, but I cant believe it is so superficial and the characters arent much more than caricatures. It wasnt probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book, but I had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I was taking a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who didnt overstep the mark of overacting (a couple of times).#0
2247_10#Im disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in Ted Demmes  Blow  Writes, directs, and stars. SEE IT.#1
12463_4#OK Hollywood is not liberal. Which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique! If you cant dazzle them with brilliance, then baffle them with Bull S.#0
11011_3#A series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day. Not as mind-numbingly awful as say  Freddy Got Fingered  or  Lost Reality , but that in NO way is an endorsement in ANY way, sense or form. Features the worst rhyming clown ever. Any most if it isnt offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct. It also has the worst song parody EVER put on film, the WORST Arnold impersonation EVER (not just the worst put on film, literally the worst EVER). I have NO clue why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan, or Slash would star in this (the reasons I watched this in the first place) The only thing mildly amusing was Dickman. In conclusion I wouldt recommend this film to ANYONE, but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something notable with you lives people. Plus if its true the Church of Scientalogy hates him, he cant be ALL bad. My Grade D#0
11876_1#I think this is almost all I need to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions though. Ive basically never seen such an armateur production, and I mean that in all senses of the word. Although the physical camera work, boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, unfortunately its not the only areas. #0
1134_2#As a Dane Im proud of the handful of good Danish movies that have been produced in recent years. Its a terrible shame, however, that this surge in quality has led the majority of Danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism. In fact, it has become so bad that I no longer trust any reviews of Danish movies, and as a result I have stopped watching them in theaters. I give this a 2-out-of-10 rating.#0
9572_8#Those individuals familiar with Asian cinema, as a whole, are aware that Japan is renowned, or notorious, for its hyper-violent films and Korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films. Dog Bites Dog, while not necessarily getting as hyper-violent as the craziest Miike film, nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some Koreas more ambitious efforts, it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all its own. The greatest strength this film has though, like the greatest of the Japanese or Korean efforts, is that the brutality, rather than detracting from the film, actually develops the characters, if not, pushing the story forward. The two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such. Sam Lees character, for instance, is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely, amidst various encounters with Changs character, it is revealed why he is. Without spoiling this part of the story too much, it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father. Changs character, on the other hand, has his most primal instincts honed to, if not perfection, brutal efficiency. Surprisingly, Changs story arch, while not necessarily revealing a more human side, actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal (and no I am not talking about Sam Lee, rather Pei Peis garbage dump girl character). Ultimately however, for the first 80 minutes or so, it is a, more or less, straight forward cat and mouse, or Dog chase Dog, film in which every encounter ends in at least one death (seriously, once Sam Lee and Chang Square off, some one will die) and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act. Which brings us to the films one weakness. Unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but, to put it simply, it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since, rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film, the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it. Dont get me wrong, if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasnt filled with sweet music (in fact if it, like the majority of the film, kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job), it still could have worked and not detract from the film. As it is though, despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters, the way it was handled made it feel tacked on, and almost, insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across. Nevertheless, it is still a breath of fresh air from Hong Kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact.#1
3551_1#This movie is just plain terrible  Slow acting, slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldnt have been on there. The best part was the showing of Iron Maiden singing in some video at a theater and thats it. the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it  The characters in this movie put me to sleep almost. Avoid it #0
1742_1#Well, maybe Im just having a bad run with Hindi movies lately. I asked the video store guy for Apharan (Prakash Jha) but being a new release, wasnt available yet. So I had to settle for this one. It turned out to be the stupidest Hindi movie Ive seen (and Ive seen quite a few). No wonder BOllywood is the laughing stock of the whole world! If IMDb had negative ratings, I would give Garam Masala a -10. Its a short review because theres nothing to write about but the usual bag of F-grade garbage. Bollywood should change its name to Follywood. And yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.#0
12273_2#PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made, unedited, sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start. It is just another Mafia-based comedy that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating. Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes, but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino is, well, the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films. The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick, pratfall fashion imaginable. What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone. Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms had this flimsy story been compressed into a half-hour gig it might have had a chance. Grady Harp#0
3508_4#Despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad  documentary,  I must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative. That said, after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it, one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands.  Ultimately though, it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie which raises the rating of the original GREY GARDENS above a single (generous) star.#0
319_1#A friend of mine bought this film for £1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of hot girls. Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.#0
3545_7#Big splashy film of the Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him IF he gives up craps. He decides on one last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), who bets big, is in town. He bets Sky that he cant get mission worker Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. That may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie! Its worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while. I give it a 7.#1
8010_7#I previously thought that this film was the lamest of the Muppet films. I would like now to retract that statement. In my opinion now, the lamest MUppet film was the TV movie ITS A VERY MERRY MUPPET Christmas, am ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE rip off that was truly dreadful. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas.  The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was the real showstopper, with Muppets from Sesame Street even appearing for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his final line What better way could anything end?. But I wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining. There are cute cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the late, great Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly entertains. I must state though that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three defininitive MUppet movies.#1
3365_1#This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her. Nell then looks across at Theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor. It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened. And can anybody explain what Nells final words mean -  Its about family. Its always been about family ? Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard.#0
3572_10#I remember watching the Disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch. Plenty of other renditions, Ever After put aside, of Cinderella, have, in fact, lost their touch throughout the years. Then I found this production with a flawless performance by Kathleen Turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood. I would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic Fairy Tale with an interesting twist. My only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other Fairy Tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print.#1
4334_10#Who wouldnt want to go on road trip with Peter Falk? That guys right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores. Women are going to love it for all the wake-up romance advice for men, and men will love it for its spot-on father/son character study--one great little scene after another. And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what its like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most fun part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falks special craft. Really delightful. Lets hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and folks.#1
8344_4#After reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so-so. I finally decided to throw in my no cents worth. I agree with most on the point that if it hadnt been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down I-77 years ago, at least as far as a tank of gas would allow. I did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion. This wee tale by the Brothers Crook is like an old record with a skip in it. As an American I understand the difficulties Ind film artists have to face. A trip to Romania would have wiped out the budget for sure. Lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of Claire in the gas station, Claire on the side of the road, Claire under the bleachers, Claire in the house, Claire in the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. It almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living but dont write a two page script and turn it into an hour,twenty flick. Before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background. All of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film. Also, there is an appearance by co-director Jeff as he is in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis derrière. Well, with all sarcasm now satisfied I still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career (I hope)and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching.#0
3268_8#A charming romantic comedy. The plot is a little too complicated--I tried to summarize it three times and I cant. Suffice to say its worth seeing. The movie is funny, beautiful--the plot is totally unrealistic but it works. Everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great--it creates a sweet, romantic feel through the entire film.  Extra bonuses--the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song  After All  sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.#1

She has been studying witchcraft by mail, and has been secretly learning it in her home, she is doing well, until three children who have been separated from their parents from the last air raid, are sent to stay in Angela Lansburys huge house. She is not happy about having them, because of her secret. They only want to go back home. The oldest boy is very hard to get along with he is a brat. The other two a boy and a girl are just inquisitive about their new place to stay and the lady that is their hostess. The kids find out about her secret and that is when the fun begins. Fun and more of it. Family fun. Laughter, frolic, adventure, something for everyone. The special effects are quite good. This is a musical the tunes are every bit as catchy to sing later as any of the other Disney films. Add this to your Family Video Library. You will not be disappointed.#1
11336_7#Answer despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier, and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth. The whole, this time, is much better than the sum of its parts.#1
704_10#This film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers Ive ever seen. If you accept that its low budget from the start, you can appreciate just how good of a story it is, how very well written the script is, and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money. All the elements of a great film are here. The visuals, though shot on digital, were gorgeous in places. The bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just amazing. Its such a trippy piece of work, but not done in a pretentious way, and because of that I have a whole lot of respect for this film. It comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there.#1
2613_2#This sequel is thoroughly uneven, incoherent and rambling in  plot  (if there really is one)and tries too damned hard to be modern (ridiculous, out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate) and cute (yawn there are too many manufactured, belaboured jokes with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and she is normally very good) sweeps through this film, parodying herself as the original De Ville and the lead from Sunset Boulevard! Its a film that isnt even good to look at. This is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, characterisation and acceptable acting. This doesnt. It is bad.#0
4864_7#In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that, only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (MR. FANCY ROMFORDS HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels). Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and dont forget, his first book, SKETCHES BY BOZ, was also a funny book). So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST (which got pretty grim at points). Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. Dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that. The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it, and the weakness of Joan Fontaine. Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role, but the flaw is really Wodehouses - he didnt make the character very interesting. But the film can stand without that, given the other performers and their characters, Gershwins music, and Wodehouses marvelous sense of fun.#1
12081_8#Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail-biter. She accepts a position as secretary to a London society dowager (played imperiously by Dame May Witty) and her creepy son (the effete and bothersome George Macready). Before she knows it, she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor shes never seen before, where Witty and Macready are calling her Marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that shes Macreadys mad wife. Of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds, and even though we know Julia has to eventually escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how shell manage it. Grade B+#1
6126_10#I saw Jack Frost for £400 at my local store and I thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was right it was good. For starters this film is about a killer snowman so thats something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the Snowman on the cover.  The acting was okay and the lines Jack Frost said had me laughing  I only axed you for a smoke  and  Worlds most pi  ed off snow cone  how funny and camp is that? The tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too  Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack gouged eyes with candle sticks . If youre looking for a for a B-Movie Comedy horror thats full of puns then check Jack Frost out. 10/10#1
2763_1#I went in to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The movie failed to meet them. In short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clichés and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer. I would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video, but Im not even sure that its worth that much.#0
5175_10#A great ensemble cast! A fond remembrance of younger carefree days. This movie takes me back to when I went to summer camp. Indian Summer, while full of practical jokes and pranks, is about growing up and coming to terms with life with middle-age life. My family & I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.#1
10289_10#WOW, finally Jim Carrey has returned from the died. This movie had me laughing and crying. It also sends a message that we should all know and learn from. Jeniffer Aniston was great, she will finally have a hit movie under her belt. If you liked liar liar you will love this movie. I give it 9/10.#1
29_10#There are some films that every Horror fan owes himself (or herself) to see, and Emilio Miraglias  La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte  aka.  The Red Queen Kills Seven Times  (1972) is definitely one of them. With Gialli and Gothic Tales being my two favorite sub-genres in Horror, I was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while, and even though my expectations were high, this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes. Miraglias earlier Giallo,  The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave  (1971) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed Giallo with Gothic Horror, but it couldnt possibly compare to this instant personal favorite.  The Red Queen Kills Seven Times  is, hands down, one of the most unique and overwhelming Italian Horror films ever made, and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it. An incredibly mesmerizing Giallo with strong Gothic elements,  The Red Queen  delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre An inventive and incredibly compelling plot, spine-chilling suspense, a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere, eerily lush colors, stylish murders, a brilliant score, and, not least, a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful Barbara Bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror. As the whole film, the murders are stylish and extremely elegant, yet frightening and macabre, and some of them are quite gory. Bruno Nicolais mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets, and makes the films intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting. The plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings, the tension-level increses with each passing minute.  The Red Queen  begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second. Overall, this is one of the films that I cannot find enough words of praise for.  The Red Queen Kills Seven Times  is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest Gialli ever made, and a top-priority for every fan of Horror and/or Italian cinema to see. 10/10#1
4526_10#This movie is really funny  The General is Keatons finest work but there are many of his works that are more hilarious - in this one are multiple sight gags and creative humor. We watch it over and over and it only seems to get funnier!#1
11759_3#For those looking for a sequel for the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s, this isnt it. Nor is it a historical drama. Rather, it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical Shaka, but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to Sinclairs idiotic story about an African superhero who is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman, and Nelson Mandela. And what kind of a name is Mungo?!#0
4336_10#The Thing About My Folks is a wonderful film about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father, but also that son with his wife, his sisters and his mother. Paul Reiser has written a semi-autobiographical movie about his relationship with his father. The movie is funny, poignant and thought-provoking. It led me to re-evaluate my own relationship with both my now-deceased father and my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Pauls father - the role could not have been better cast. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser are recognized in next years movie awards for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his script.#1
3919_3#This movie is not as good as all think. the actors are lowlevel and the story is very comic-like. I respect fantasy but Lord of the Rings is fantasyConan..is fantasyTHIS IS JUST NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENTWhy did they include this Splatter-tongue, it makes everything worse. The only good thing is the cinematography and the cutters Job.#0
3410_3#Yes, this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now. Kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kids kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space. This camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things. Give it a rest, they are there for fun, not to become astronauts just yet, just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp. However, you do get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role. So in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me. Probably for a few others as well, who else would like to see Kate Capshaws face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature.#0
7761_2#After a series of power-outages on a remote island zoo, genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island. Man, the sci-fi channel has made some bad  original  movies, but I think this might possibly be their worst so far! This badly written and directed  Jurassic Park  rip-off offers all the usual clichés (mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are  expendable losses , characters walking down long dark hallways alone, brain-dead teen characters whos only function in the film is to die a horrible death, etc.), and, unsurprisingly, no suspense whatsoever. The special effects are atrociousthe puppet heads in close-ups of the title beasties are bad enough, looking like stiff plush dolls, but the CGIwhich makes the computer-generated dinosaurs in  Walking with Dinosaurs  look life-like by comparisonare just downright awful. Theres some gore, but most of it looks pretty unconvincing. Oh, and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things Ive seen in years. I couldnt even laugh it was so bad! Oh, and heres some interesting trivia for youthis film borrowed music cues from the 2003 sci-fi film  Alien Hunter , which was far superior to this piece of crap.#0
8647_1#Amateurish in the extreme. Camera work especially overwrought - documentary camera operators neednt spin around ALL THE TIME. Who financed this crap?#0
7765_4#Strange, almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie. Is it because its from 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling?  Or is it because I am subconsciously irritated about the fact that English-speaking actors try to behave as their French counterparts?#0
10521_1#This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4. I have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose. This is also a  horror  film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight. My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared. The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie, half of the time she is British and half the time she is American.#0
6943_9#The traditional Western is synonymous with wide open spaces, clearcut morality, inevitable storylines, the optimistic faith in a heros ability to shape his own destiny, to escape his past. These qualities reflect directly the American sense of self, the self-shaping Dream, the pushing of boundaries and frontiers, which is why the genre is still alluded to by opportunistic politicians. With some noble exceptions (eg Wellman, Hawks), the Western was healthily free of neuroses or real anxiety. Anthony Mann changed all that forever, and this first foray into the genre is one of the most violent, vivid, complex, not to say exciting Westerns ever made. The old John Ford silhouette of riders on a vast mountain is reprised, but signals here not progress but repetition and circularity. But for all its deconstruction, the film is also tangibly vivid in a way few Westerns ever achieve. Manns incisive technique intrudes his camera in crucial positions, alternating revealing distance with intense examination, making the saloon doors and stagecoaches seem thrillingly alive and lived in.#1
8468_3# They Are Among Us  is poor science fiction at best. Mediocre acting bogs down this film. The plot holes are numerous. Aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human. In their alien form they supposedly have exo-skeletons (which is why they need the plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails. The heroines father  disappeared  after Project Blue Book closed, but was supposedly an F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, pick  Invasion of the Body Snatchers , and see how it is done right.#0
7897_8#At first sight this movie doesnt look like a particular great one. After all a Bette Davis movies with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6,5 must be a rather bad one. But the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. 8/10#1
2809_8#The saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and NO-ONE felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards. Oh, and I will add a personal comment about AIDS. Despite everything, there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror. When AIDS first arrived, it was called the  gay cancer , and governments preferred to  let them die  rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags. Then it became clear that AIDS would also be a heterosexual disease. But the government wasnt ready for that; So when straight people began getting ill too, the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves (examples The Names Project the quilt memorializing all those who died of AIDS; Act Up etc) The result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them, because no other organizations existed. This close contact, in my estimation, is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals. When AIDS first came on the scene, many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if straights didnt suddenly become ill too; nevertheless, the strides that have been made in gay liberation - to the point that, as I write this, there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage - these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without AIDS to bring us together. It is sad to think that all those people - both straight and gay - had to die before our common humanity became more obvious - but if what I am writing here is true, and I think it is - then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain.#1
4615_10#I think that people are under estimating this incredible film. People are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep. Which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have Stephanie beaton. This is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film. The general view on this movie is that it has bad acting, a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this. But i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiecethat has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining.#1
25_7#I never saw this when I was a kid, so this was seen with fresh eyes. I had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter. Plus, the idea of Christopher Walken singing and dancing made me curious. The special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was entranced. I loved watching Walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him. Very amusing to see him dance! And if the songs werent great, at least they werent Disney over-produced saccharine sweetness. The ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly, we had recently read  Puss in Boots , and I had wondered about the implausibility of the story. But while staying true to almost every aspect, Walkens acting made it believable. Great fun. Id watch it again with my daughter.#1
12311_9# Chinese Ghost Story  is one of the most amazing Hong Kong films I have ever seen.Its a brilliant mix of fantasy,comedy,romance,horror and martial arts.The film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights.I love especially the fight scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue.Truly original and refreshing film and another Embalmers fine recommendation.#1
2010_3#Oh, its the movie - I thought I waited too long to take out the dog I cant believe I watched the whole thing. I guess I was optimistically anticipating that it was going to get better. Horribly disjointed dialog, pathetic acting, and totally improbable events. Like Tobys mom hanging herself in the time it takes Col to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a 24 ceiling and no chairs, counters or anything around her motionlessly suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in. The little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the puppy of the first couple was a close second. The basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick, but this version sadly is not it. I get more scared when I open my electric bill every month.#0
9057_7#Lets keep it simple My two kids were glued to this movie. It has its flaws from an adult perspective, but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it.  Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the dads.)#1
4679_10#Terrific film with a slightly slow start - give it a chance to get cooking. Story builds in interest and complexity. Characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments. Superb New York City locations - gritty, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of  Sex in the City  - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to the HBO/Hollywood notion of New York City , sex and relationships. Its a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. LOVED IT! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and her love interest (forgot his name!).#1
12035_8#I recently stumbled across this film on TNT five minutes into it, while on vacation in Florida (hey there has to be some down time in the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any feature length film on TNT. I mean  Drive Me Crazy  isnt THAT old already, is it? #1
9504_2#The only reason I watched this film was because I had recently read Robert Houghs less than perfect, but interesting, fictionalised account of the life of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in a less than flattering light. Historicaly interesting.#0
8126_7#I must admit a slight disappointment with this film; I had read a lot about how spectacular it was, yet the actual futuristic sequences, the Age of Science, take up a very small amount of the film. The sets and are excellent when we get to them, and there are some startling images, but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards  Things to Come , as it stands, is an intriguing oddity, well worth perusing, yet far short of a  Metropolis  Tis much as  silly , in Wells words, as that Lang film, yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it.#1
9715_7#Heres the skinny, it seems that this is much older then I thought it was. But its still cool. The bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part. There are some character issues that I hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that it seems to be a MACROSS knock off. Not just the animation style but several character designs. For example all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY of MACROSS. The mechs look similar to MACROSS as well as the other characters. This is really not made for little kids, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So to make a long story short I give this cool MACROSS knock-off 7 STARS.#1
6290_3#Recap Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deeply and love and certain they are perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago. Todd, Rons brother in law to be is not so happy. He is afraid the marriage is a threat to his cushy job in the family business and decides to arrange Rons bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation, get evidence and break Ron and Mel up. 3/10#0
2110_3#Now I love Bela Lugosi,dont get me wrong,he is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie but he certainly did his share of clunkers.This is just another one of those. And he was right----we horror fans will always have a love for Bela Lugosi.He gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera.We do give two f  ks for you,Bela.#0
8173_8#The brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. Its one of mans primal fears. This movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who I guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so its not really working out. In a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor Earl Boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot, which I guess is the absolute worst you can do when youre a killer dentist. Its a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written but theres gore. The plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey, its a killer dentist movie, weve all thought of it but they did it first.#1
5452_8#A pre-code stunner with Stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps her way to the top. These pre-code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination. Stanwyck is outstanding as Lilly the daughter of a speakeasy owner/father who sold more than booze to his patrons(johns).After the old man dies(good!) Barb heads for the big city for better things.She uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top. John Wayne makes a poor  cameo  and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach. I loved the banter and strong lines between the actors. I highly recommend this film to all film buffs and to watch Stanwyck who is great and beautiful as Lilly.#1
6633_10#The first film ever made. Workers streaming from a factory, some cycling, most walking, moving right or left. Along with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with Melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; with the Lumieres pure, unadorned, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former. worse is the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. The bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates, the workers are confined in their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority entrapping its servants. A frightening, all too prophetic movie.#1
5423_4#Ive been using IMDb for a few years now, but have never written any reviews before. However, this movie so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I couldnt keep quiet anymore. Overall, I think its very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as its pretty much shoved down your throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a big way. Just one guys opinion, cheers.#0
10827_10#Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but Id take a successful self-ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap.#1
3910_2#Isabel Allendes magical, lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized. The lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted--largely due to a magnificent cast of Anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive Latin mellifluousness of Allendes characters, and a plodding Scandinavian directorial hand--was so uncomfortable in its own skin that I returned to the theater a second time to make certain I had not missed something vital that might change my opinion. To my disappointment, I had not missed a thing. None among Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director Bille August. All of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if, by putting forth as little effort as possible, they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets. (Yes, the film was art directed within an inch of its life.) Curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing KFC products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970--years before KFC came into being. Back then, it was known by its original name Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even pardoning that, what on earth is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s.  The House of the Spirits  should have been the motion picture event of 1993. Because it was so club-footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither event nor art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have pressed charges for rape.#0
1962_2#The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel. Add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the movie ends up a complete failure. If only MST3K could have had a go at this one #0
11283_8# Tarzan and His Mate , the second of MGMs Tarzan pictures, picks up a year after the events of  Tarzan the Ape Man . Tarzan and Jane have been living happily in the jungle, and Harry Holt (one of the expeditioners in the first film) returns, this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable Martin Arlington, in quest of the ivory from the elephants graveyard. Naturally, a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way. Like the first film,  Tarzan and His Mate  has amazing action scenes, wonderful wildlife footage, and one of the screens all-time greatest romances. If you liked the first film in the series, this is definitely a sequel to see.#1
10400_1#Enough is enoughsometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead. The first Tremors movie was great. The second one was ridiculous. The third one was nauseating. The tv series was depressingly awful. And this movie just drives the stake deeper. Movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy. Avoid this garbage.#0
9544_2#I didnt enjoy this film. I thought the acting wasnt very good and the story was boring. A 20year old computer saving the day? I thought that this was just slightly far fetched, even for a film. I couldnt figure out why they couldnt just turn it off, why not take a sledgehammer to it. Even if the old computer hadnt have turned up to save day, this would still, in my opinion, be a very very cheesy flick..#0
10709_1#I cant think of much to say about this film.  If a movie is going to be this idiotic, it should be laughably stupid -- at the very least. It wasnt. It was just pathetic.#0
4912_4#Having not read the novel, I cant tell how faithful this film is. The story is typical mystery material killer targets newlyweds; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and thats exactly how it plays. The first 2/3 are dull, save for the murders and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusion. Summing it up this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by TV standards(watch CSI, instead). If youre in the mood for a film like this, Ive some excellent suggestions pick up a copy of Dario Argentos  Deep Red (my highest recommendation; superb film),  Opera , or even  Tenebre . Theyre stronger in every category.#0
9333_1#Terrible  I dont want to be too negative but this film has an IQ of stupid monkey.What a disaster.I just couldnt believe how bad this movie is.The dialogs are just very strange and off topic,the camera work at times just horrible,the music at times like a soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia,I just watched this film to see how much worse it can get.Some of the side kick  actors  are total disaster.Sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film. . . . . this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film#0
4481_1#I was skeptical when I first saw the Calvin Kline-esque commercials, but thought Id give it a chance. So Ive watched it, and all I can say is bleh. This movie was so bad. Its rare that I hate a movie this much. Watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in Altmans  The Player,  when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers. Id like to know which MTV producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of Bronte (but this time Heathcliffs name is Heath and hes a rock star, and Hindleys name is Hendrix) would be a good idea. On the bright side, there was one entertaining scene -- specifically the moment when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigls face -- and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you.#0
4289_3#The Education of Little Tree is just not as good as it could have been. Little Trees education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you. Whatever happened to the three Rs? Readin Ritin and Rithmetic? When the idiot back talks the teacher at the boarding school place he starts crying and talking to the sky. Oh my gosh. Sure, the lady was a little harsh, but then James Cromwells character comes and takes him away, leaving the audience thinking that Little Tree was absolutely right. He should learn to adapt to new discipline. Those were the times! Talking to a star is not going to change a thing! Little Tree needs to learn that his adoring guardians are not always right.#0
4520_7#Somewhat too long and going over the top towards the end, this comedy is an utterly delightful, never condescending or ridiculing look into the problems of a  power man , who likes to wear women s clothes at nite. Julie Walters is lovely as always, but Adrian Pasdar is utterly credible and steals the film. He (she)is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and silk stockings.#1
7783_7#A young girl surviving as a prostitute. They meet each other in Thailand. You may think by the opening titles its going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life. This film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images, but still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos.  Its not an original joke but it is well told  says a character and that also applies to this one Weve seen the story but this way we see it. Thailand appears in hot tones, the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place. And it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons. There is also a good use of the music to dot the actions.#1
983_7#I think this film has much to recommend it, particularly an especially sinister performance by David Morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching Mr. Foxx. Although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very hard to follow in some cases, all in all, it makes for a nice time in front of the tube.#1
9376_1#while watching this movie I got sick. I have been grewing up with Pippi and every time was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh. but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again. it is terrible from beginning to its end. how can they manage to make it soo bad. well I guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha.. but they are never close to Pippi. may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast. burn the movie and save the kids. if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh. WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin you will never stand up to be Pippi.. Oh yes.. when read the  spoilers  explanation,   spoiling a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film.  well I guess the director stands for this you are looking at this movie at your own risk.. it is really a waste of time#0
2590_7#The people who are bad-mouthing this film are those who dont understand film to begin with. These are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that doesnt star Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first, but what it lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in substance. One thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was its use of music, which plays a large part. Those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie, both in Vida and Wilders life, and in the background. Wilders theme, Vidas theme, and Wallaces theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out. For instance, in the scene where the men are singing  Duke of Earl , Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like  She is my girl , and then she goes over to Wallace to give him something when the men sing the lyric  She will be my girl  cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers There are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie, and while it may look like a flop on the outside, the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is.#1
9834_10#Yeah sure its cheesy, its not Zombie, but its not that bad either. It has Beatrice Ring which is a huge bonus, and its entertaining. I had the good fortune to meet Fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience, as he was never completely satisfied with it. It is well worth a search out, especially for genre and Fulci fans. It is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand.#1

12072_2#Blood Legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake (Norman Bartold) to the Dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased Christopher Dean (John Carradine), upon his arrival he is greeted by Mr. Deans four children, Gregory (Jeff Morrow) & his wife Laura (Merry Anders), Victoria (Faith Domergue), Johnny (Richard Davalos) plus Leslie (Brooke Mills) & her fella Carl Isenberg (John Smith). Drake plays a tape recording of theyre late Fathers wishes after his death, the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children, if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest & if all were to die the freaky servants Elga (Ivy Bethune), Igor (Buck Kartalian) & the more mundanely named Frank (John Russell) would pocket the lot. Well, not satisfied with a quarter share of $136 million (which is still almost $35 million back in 1971 which doesnt sound too bad to me) someone decides they want it all for themselves & its not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge Blood Legacy is an awful film, there really isnt a single positive aspect to it or if there is I cant think of it. Do yourself a favour & dont bother with this one, there are much better films out there.#0
12474_9#And look how a true story,   with a little help of its friends   a welldone and touching script, a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of  no-name  actors, especially from the 4-yr-old Jodelle Ferland, becomes a must seen movie. 9/10#1
2633_8#I have to be honest, i was expecting a failure so bad, because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. But that wasnt the case with this pretty funny (sometimes odd) movie. I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny. The jacuzzi bubble, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. Its all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to Video and DVD movie. While the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end, it works. 8 out of 10#1
9214_3#Many things become clear when watching this film 1) the acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict borders soap opera-ish. The other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical Im-a-babe-but-Im-really-sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbies dreams and episodes are disturbing (acted by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice ( we are all special friends ); 5) the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting; and 5) this is a really bad movie. Expect to be disappointed--and probably disturbed.#0
2016_2#     Warning May contain SPOILERS          My HUGE problem with this movie is how totally self-centered and self consumed the adulteress wife is  After having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him. He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together. He is OBVIOUSLY crazy and very dangerous. The problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to HER (and exposing her secret). Not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband! Did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic?? As soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences. Maybe there wouldnt have been a movie then but there really wasnt one anyway so whats the difference.#0
5863_1#I really cant believe this movie is not in the IMDB worst 250, it is absolutely terrible. When I originally saw it I remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it. We were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible. By the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was. Dont be like them, just pass this by. Im sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie.#0
4680_10#Terrfic film with a slightyly slow start - give it a chance to start cooking. Story builds in interest and complexity. Characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments. Superb New York City locations - gritty, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of  Sex in the City  - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to the HBO/Hollywood notion of New York City , sex and relationships. Its a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. LOVED IT! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and her love interest (forgot his name!).#1
7024_8#I just saw this film in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on it, so i thought id check it out. i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again. the actors were really good and i loved all the music! there was not a lot of talking in the film, which at first felt a little strange- but once i got into it, i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination. i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things, but know that i left the theater thinking about the film. it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique.#1
12475_10#What an inspiring movie, I laughed, cried and felt love. For a true story,it does give you hope and that miracles do happen. It has a great cast. Ellen Burstyn, Samantha Mathis, Jodelle Ferland(shes 4 or 5yrs. old) what a actress. Its on Showtime. A Must See Movie  )=#1
10483_8#Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material. But then it doesnt try to be anything it is not. A fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners, a stellar and very funny performance by Peter OToole, a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright. The bands performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a deft, comical manner. The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely. From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads. A good example is the comment about the  strange baseball-like game , well my dear American, that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant US band was very funny for those that do know cricket. Also no, you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said  oh yes!  to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time  oh no  also referring to the money. Jeez, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people All-in-all I enjoyed it and had some great laughs! Well worth seeing.#1
7491_7#Years ago, I found a  bargain bin  copy of this film for a buck or two. In so many ways, this is quite fitting, as when it was made back in 1933, it was truly a cheaply made film by the  poverty row  studio, Majestic. However, while the film is rather derivative, it is STILL well worth watching and provides a few surprises. Overall, for fans of old horror films, this is excellent and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, its probably pretty skip-able.#1
967_3#In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as a  thinking mans horror film.  Wow, you might say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. It features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British (dubbed) accent, and a story with no chills, thrills or spills. A short no on this one.#0
2983_2#Zombi 3 starts as a group of heavily armed men steal a experimental chemical developed to reanimate the dead, while trying to escape the man is shot at & the metal container holding the chemical is breached. The man gets some of the green chemical on a wound on his hand which soon after turns him into a flesh eating cannibalistic zombie. Within hours the surrounding area is crawling with the flesh easting undead on the look out for fresh victims, Kenny (Deran Sarafian) & his army buddies find themselves in big trouble as they stop to help Patricia (Beatrice Ring) & her friend Lia (Deborah Bergammi) who has been pecked by zombie birds (!). General Morton is in charge of the situation & has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world! But will he & his men succeed? Zombi 3 is not a sequel to Fulcis classic zombie gore fest Zombi 2 (1979), it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash-in title. Im sorry but Zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film, its boring, it makes no sense, its not funny enough to be entertaining & it lacks any decent gore. One to avoid.#0
2887_1#I just watched this movie today and not only is it, terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man. I also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with its clear crisp just filmed view. If I had half a mind I would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to itwell maybe members of Al Queda..especially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in prison on life sentences with out parole.just make a set up like a clock work Orange, And then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again.#0
6974_4#Blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense. At one point,some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels, exploring.  Im embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember I suppose!#0
7221_1#.CAUSE ITS CRAP! The kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say  WHY? . Horrible camera workcount the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and cant. The dialog is ridiculous. The acting is comical. It looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible. Id bet $10 they used home video cameras to make this. Either that, or most of the cameramen were drunk. Truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie. If you ever want to host a  Worst Movie Party , bring this one. Want more entertainmentstare at a wall.#0
6066_2#I was looking forward to seeing John Carpenters episode in Season 2 because his first, Cigarette Burns, was by far the best from Season 1 (and I did like other episodes from that season). Oh, how I was disappointed. Ill also take this opportunity to note that the show title, Masters of Horror, is a bad title to have. There simply arent many actual  masters of horror  around. Maybe two or three. If the show were called  Tale of Horror  or something like that it would be fine. But as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes, and therefore being criticized for not being a  master of horror  is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career. And it didnt even have to be a good one.#0
12357_7#I really liked this movie, and went back to see it two times more within a week. The whole movie is a real treat #1
4992_4#This movie is just another average action flick, but it could have been so much better. When the guns come out they really needed some choreography help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in Heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the show-down, the one we had been waiting for, but was like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing hits, and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old, same old.#0
10273_8#Im a big fan of films where people get conned, and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of the films where people get conned genre. In short, its an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels, and never truly revealing whats happening, while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what youve just seen. The film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; its still difficult to guess where its going, and every twist comes off as a surprise. As mentioned, Im a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler. She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con. House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his films setting in the underground levels of the city. The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill. Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, hes always solid and believable as the villain of the piece. Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role. She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. The way that the film executes its plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. At times its almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film. Another thing thats great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if youre interested in making twenty bucks, say. All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride.#1
2641_10#Green Eyes is a great movie. In todays context of supporting our troops, it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty, during this period. From a historical view, the end of the Vietnam war left all of us with something to remember and learn from. Gene was very proud of this movie, and he deserved the credits he received from writing  Green Eyes . I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, or at all. This movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on TV every year, much like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky#1
961_9#The only reason Im giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played Tadashis tormentors were not up to the job. I presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy, but they were not well coached, and their scenes were a minor annoyance.  Early on, theres a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book. There was a TV commercial in Japan a couple years before this movie came out. It was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid whos depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room. His mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up. Then, someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune, but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead. I mention this commercial, because it was considered funny, and I didnt hear any objections to it while I was there. There is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in  The Great Yokai War  than one would find in a Disney movie. As a parent, if this were a U.S. film, I would be up in arms about such things, although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture, which, of course, are also not black and white. Since its a Japanese movie, I accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a U.S. production. However, Id probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre-show briefing and/or post-show debriefing about the violence and other off- color stuff, or Id wait till theyre older to show it to them.#1
2819_3#The Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a dual role, gratuitous sex and nudity, murder and mayhem on paper Tobe Hoppers Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun, entertaining flick given the ingredients. Its not. It is a plot less, incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment. There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That is pretty much it- I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking. Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness, dream sequences and erotic encounters, intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery. It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness, bad acting, sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads. There arent too many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, whilst not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see the movie from which the  When youre as criminal as I  bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from.#0
8637_4#More of a mystery movie with some gratuitous horror elements thrown in; mediocre overall. I was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by Fulci to Clive Barker! Interesting.#0
3646_1#Oh my god this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie I have ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole film just doesnt make sense. Couple this with mediocre directing, really strange scenes (such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in), and thoroughly abysmal dialog ( Look!   Musta peed his pants! ), and you get one complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars. But this is part of the movies charm. Sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh.  I love this movie, because its just SO BAD #0
8567_1#When I rented this movie, I had very low expectationsbut when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less (a lot less) than what I expected. The actors were bad (the doctors wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupidit could work for a Disney movie (except for the murders), but this one is not a comedy, it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity. The title is well chosen except for one thing they could add stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give it 0 and a half out of 5.#0
9682_3#To overcome the death of his wife, an old man does what anyone in his position would naturally do (at least in a Peter Greenaway movie) he and his son populate their home with eight and a half (one has no legs) women and embark on a sexual odyssey. This being a Greenaway film, there is lots of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and of course there is unnecessary male nudity. In fact the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude. Gross. Besides, who wants to see an old guy full frontal? For those who are not into the homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to do the nasty with horses. There is no story - just a random collection of dull scenes.#0
5664_8#I really like this show. I can readily see how it achieved cult status. Its original, and thought provoking. For some reason though, I have never felt the kind of resonance from it that I could have. It doesnt pack the kind of open door, winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise. Each time I watch an episode, I find myself prodding, and pushing for it to answer some nameless, formless question. Either way, its a grievous loss to both genre fans, and casual viewers alike.#1
7228_9#The undoubted highlight of this movie is Peter OTooles performance. In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anybody do it better than OToole? I dont think so. What a great face that man has! The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter OTooles luminous performance and Im sure I wouldnt have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadnt been in it.#1
907_8#This movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional Indian values which are being replaced by western ones.Its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around.Shahid Kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with Amrita Rao who is also very Desi and she also acts pretty wellThe genre of the movie is the same as HAHK and such movies deserve to be made in India for the revival of old traditional valuesThe movies doesnt get 10 as it isnt very good at music which counts a lot in every movie,besides this it is flawless.#1
7681_9#Child Sexploitation is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and I feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience. After having seen both Trade and Holly, one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws. The other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide.  For anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something I would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of Holly.#1
2050_2#Not that  a film by Ulli Lommel  filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects, which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the  mockumentary  style, because it never looks like anything other than video. Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. It does not feel like watching a movie. And whats even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He ought to know better. He ought to know that its virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video. For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. And lucky us, he wrote the script too! So you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied. Please, please miss this film. Youll thank me later.#0

10492_10#I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video. Since then its become one of my favorites! The plot isnt particularly complex but it doesnt take away from the entertainment. Its chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it. The characters are what makes the movie so good. They each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor, the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law leaps to mind. Superb acting was done by all, particularly Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments. If youre looking for a good comedy Id definately recommend this movie!#1
10566_8#Never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by Cagney and the other cast members namely Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler, (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing Prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theaters during the 1930s. Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows. This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs. Joan Blondell, (Nan Prescott) gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career. Enjoy.#1
5264_7#A delight mini movie, a musical short based on three of Cole Porters Broadway smash songs. Bob Hopes first credited film is a delight! He plays an American playboy millionaire on vacation in Paris. The film opens with him sitting at a table of an out door café telling his friends about this beauty that takes his breath away. Suddenly he spots her a few yards away. he is so over come his friends tease him and suggest  just show her your bank book.  But Hope claims he can win her in less than 30 days with  no  money! They bet polo ponies over the issue and take all his cash and IDs. Hope follows her and when they are alone gushes out a proposal she does not believe he is sincere until he sings to her,  You Do Something to Me  by Cole Porter. But she must leave and he tries to earn money as a tour guide so he can pursue her. But when she sees him showing another girl around town, disillusioned she wants to drop him. He continues to chase her and catches up to her and her family at a race track where he bets his meager earnings on the last race hoping to win enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers he loses the winning ticket and she decides to marry him rich or poor. So he wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs #1
6808_1#What a complete piece of trash. Plot notwithstanding, when a movies action revolves around airplanes, youd think the writers/producers/director (or ANYONE!) would do a little bit of homework as to at least a FEW of the details. The mistakes were so glaring that I was fuming by the end of the movie. Here are just a few Im glad I missed the SR-71 sequence - certain to have been worse than the  Air Force One  F-117 spectacle. Commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than BOEING 747  likely the (cheap) use of some Boeing advertising/publicity footage by the director. Exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring, much less multi-million dollar aircraft avionics wiring. Airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ships supply oxygen to maintain breathable air, and if they did rely on an on-board supply, the canister would be far bigger than fist sized. Medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection. Those were F-16s, NOT F-15s. Mach 1+ (speed of sound) would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff (watch the airspeed indicator).  Standard formation  is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile,  route  formation is what they were flying - not the most useful formation for an intercept.  Acquiring missile lock  is not likely to get an airline pilots attention - they have no radar detection or countermeasures.  Wait for my signal  is not inter-flight communication for preparing to fire anything. Depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank. Yelling into a headset does not make it transmit. Magnetic headings are given as  headings  not  bearings,  and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees (compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground!), so turning left (not  port   thats a boat thing) from a  bearing  of 618 to 502 is just stupid. It is in most cases impossible to just  turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached   that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again. The likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely. Airplanes dont stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back, and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multi-engine thrust. Flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension, not seconds before landing (good way to crash). Wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane, simply pulling the throttle(s) (this time a different lever in the movie) to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed. Did I mention that those fighter aircraft were F-16s and NOT F-15s? Guess I did And thats just what I REMEMBER from recently watching this horrific movie.#0
5910_8#OK, OK, dont get bent out of round. I was kidding. But Ralphie REALLY should have re-thought that title.#1
5575_8#I didnt expect much from this, but I have to admit I was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film. If you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes, this might be a film for you. Ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching Amanda Peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half. Its certainly not a momentous work of comedy, but given the low-budget indy genesis this is masterful. To level the playing field for comparison, imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network for seeing this through. I look forward to his next effort.#1
5669_1#The director, outfitted in chains and leather, warned the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival Friday night that we were about to see an  experiental  film. Experimental? Leave the video camera on the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight. A meandering pastiche road show manqué that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place. The gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the Castro theater. I would have left, too, but my cine-buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end. By the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably. Tepid applause. Pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product. Avoid this film #0
4702_8#If this movie proves only one thing, its that Keaton is, was and always will be a comic at heart, even when dodging bullets, heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison. Eight stars. Check out  Johnny Dangerously  dont be a  bastidge .#1
9921_3#Strummers hippie past was a revelation, but overall this felt like crashing a wake. Campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire. There were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage. I love The Clash and Joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now (FU Mick Jones), but this doc left me wanting..to relate more. Using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent. They should have been interviewed on their own. Even using Strummers radio DJ voice did little to glue the film together. And can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes? After the awesome  Filth And The Fury  I hoped Temple could deliver. A Joe Strummer doc deserves better.#0
6459_10#Back to the roots with  like it is in heaven  - what are the real values of life? These Swedes carve out a message that appeals to every heart. Weve seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat love pure and joy within the music of a choir thats simple, yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone.  Dont go see it if youve been normed to Hollywood. This stuff contains no extras, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears #1
9715_4#This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pinos hot-headed character would have been transferred to the  rubber gun squad  years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character theyve ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a  race traitor  who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites. Whats more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they wont serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DAs careers.#0
8655_1#What a terrible film. It sucked. It was terrible. I dont know what to say about this film but DinoCrap, which I stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  sigh.. Its not Roger Corman that I hate, its this god-awful movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics. Which is another thing, the CGI sucked out loud; I hate this movie dreadfully. This is without a doubt the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably the gayest B-Movie too. Its-its--- DINOCRAP! Im sorry, I must have offended some nerds in these moments. Its just an awful movie 0/1,000#0
6726_3#Anyone who has seen Shine,Scott Hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist David Helfgotts; will I am sure realise that The SOLOIST is very poor in comparison.It is as slow as a lullaby( I took five breaks answering emails just to wake up). The depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent, on a par I fear with the awful beach battle depiction in Joe Wrights other disaster Attonment. .J Fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset.Downey on the other hand; although struggling with a badly paced film, still manages to charm,9Is it me or is he turning into George Clooney in more ways than one?). Comparing both these well known so called STARactors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of shines Geoeffry Rush whos brilliant performance definitely SHONE far brighter in my sky. With both Attonment and The Soloist the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject. Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD its bound to be in the bargain basement soon.#0
3547_8#Entertaining musical where Nathan Detroit needs $1,000.00 to get up a floating crap game so he entices Sky Masterson to try and get salvation army girl, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson to Havana. All in all, its a very nice production.#1
334_10#Its very simple to qualify that movie  A PURE MASTERPIECE . This opinion is formulated for the following reasons the performance of the actors, they seem to be citizens of that epoch, 1100 B.C. They personalize perfectly the characters. A second reason is that the poetry expressed by Homere in his poem is well given by the production. Among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition. Third reason the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect, in Mediterranean regions, where the action of the poem occurred. And most of all, the emotion is on the rendezvous. I repeat my appreciation  A PURE MASTERPIECE .#1
7283_8#I love buying those cheap, lousy DVDs from Alpha Video. One day, I happened to buy this one. Its the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50s, all sexed up. Replete with unscientific EVERYTHING, scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama, its an enjoyable film, to those who appreciate this kind of stuff. And if you can suspend your disbelief enough, you can actually get creeped out-- not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet, but toward the end, with the character of the perfect body. Its so . . . . whats another word for mindf   ing?#1

10562_9#Such energy and vitality. You just cant go wrong with Busby Berkley films and this certainly must be his best. Of course the choreography is wonderful, but also the banter between Cagney and Blondell is so colorful and such a delight. Dont miss this one.#1
9019_8#Not wishing to give  anything  away here, I would just say this technically excellent, flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a halfs entertainment It will amuse, surprise, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way. Most definitely recommended. A previous Users Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carters outstanding performances - I agree entirely.#1
8730_8#Many of the American people would sayWhat??? to my opening comment. Yes I know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. We have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village. The great difference is the way that the story takes. Our samurais, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs, HEROES. Please watch again this incredible movie (the Seven Samurai, obviously) and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa. A tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to wrote his Best sellers, but he didnt found the third foot of the cat.#1
8184_4#This is almost like two films--one literate and engaging, the other stupid and clichéd. Its really a shame all the problems werent worked out with the writing, but considering how quickly most B-movies were written and produced, this isnt too unusual. Its a real shame, though, as this could have been a very good film. First the good. The movie is original and involves WWII code-breakers. This is pretty fascinating and I liked watching the leading man (Lee Bowman) go through his paces as a master code-breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. But now for the bad, the film just went on way too long and lost steam at about 50 minutes. Additionally, Jean Rogers role as the  kooky girlfriend  must rank as one of the worst-written and distracting roles in film history  For every smart move made by Bowman, the idiot Rogers then stepped in to screw things up as some sort of misguided  comedy relief . If her role had been intelligently written, the overall film would have improved immensely! Instead, watching her, its hard to understand how we actually won WWII #0
7998_9#I loved this movie. Im a Mexican and was in the least offended by it. In fact, I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico. Its a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. It angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washingtons character. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the ones Creasy did his fine job upon. That would be so marvelous (Sorry, I am THAT resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you cant miss. It might be hard on some of you, if you arent used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzykind of like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. I swear youll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK ) is a bit sad, but Im sure youll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the years best movies. A  must own  for a DVD collection! 9  out of 10#1
12006_4#OK the director remakes LOVE ACTUALLY The director Nikhil Advani after debuting with KHNH does his second half and wait Salman Khan doesnt act only, just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god Priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her, she does get better towards the end Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is okay Shannon is okay#0
10755_1#I cant really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction. Forget the product placement disaster, the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plot-holes. This wasnt only laughable and but painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children. What a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after weve had Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (by the same director). This one really belongs in the bottom 100 list. Truly awful.#0

It cant be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic. 7 out of 10 broken hearts#1
9583_8#I waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when I first saw it over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write.  Now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, I lived through the so called Madonna craze. I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her  Vogue  phase and rightfully so. If not for those individuals, Madonna wouldnt have HAD a  Vogue  phase, I know that now. Credit should be given where credit is DUE. Makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream America would watch this documentary, theyll learn theyre not as  mainstream  as they think.#1
12238_3#A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but There is a particularly (and amusingly) strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy, like boomerangs. I understand if they dont want to have guns being shot in a family film, but then why have guns in the first place?#0
10835_10#I love this movie. It is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging. Congratulations  I believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves. It is so eerie, you feel like you are watching a real life band. I would like to see more movies like this. I am glad that they did not choose famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked. And even if Billy Connolly is quite well known, he really got stuck into the role and I could not imagine anybody else playing it. Congratulations again, I really believe this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And when you get to the final scene.. well what can I say #1
1881_1#This movie sucks ass. Something about a heatwave in some European country, complete trash. Theres nothing going for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds of sex but thats it. There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off. This movie is complete rash and you shouldnt subject yourself to watching it. I regret it its very boring. I would rate it zero but i cant. No body in their right mind should see this. im sure youll regret it completely i did. How could they think up something this bad. Even Mystery men was better. MYSTERY MEN. That sucks. That movie wasnt worth being made. complete waste of time. The characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored.#0
7819_9#What a movie! I never imagined Richard Attenborough could have such a movie in him. Gandhi has always left me indifferent, apart from Ben Kingsleys performance, and I never considered Attenborough a particularly good filmmaker. But Cry Freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times. Its an exciting, mesmerizing political movie with great performances by Kevin Kline and a young Denzel Washington. Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of Denzel Washington. This is a movie to be cherished in its entirety. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit. This movie deserve a place alongside movies like The Pianist, Life Is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.#1
6078_1#I rarely comment on films but Ive read the other comments and I cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish. I know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit; poorly acted, badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along. I am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want. All I can say is it is a terrible film, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateurish and I am glad they could not make a film like this legally today#0
8807_9#This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world. The documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts, the only thing being shared is 9/11 as a theme (very minor in some cases). Some of the segements are weak while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are solely about 9/11, some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch on human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic). This film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful. Even though the final product is uneven, with some segments being almost  pointless , I still recommend this. Its very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place (some weak, some very powerful; ). Im giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).#1
11468_9#I am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the Columbine Massacre. There isnt a major documentary, very puzzling. Fortunately we are graced with the talent of Ben Coccio who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant who did the equally fine ELEPHANT. Two different takes on the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that theres something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers, and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality. ZERO DAY, purportedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event, is absolutely riveting. Even if you know where its going, you still harbor hope that it WONT  go there   and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating. The film is terrific from top to bottom, from director to script (not much improvised, though it appears very spontaneous) to the two lead actors, and the supporting players as well. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that troubled me. Okay, so we cant fathom why the shooters would do what they did, but certainly one of the contributors was their ANGER. Yet these boys dont really seem angry. They may say some things to indicate that they are, but in fact they didnt convince me that they had SOMETHING inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people. But this still leaves me with the sense of  why???  that director Coccio wants me to have. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time. The BLAIR WITCH folks could only WISH for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary.#1

7961_10# Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey  is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets. Deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general, together with other animal movies like  Old Yeller ,  Napoleon ,  Fluke  and  Air Bud . This means it is more than just a movie about pets. This should definitely be on Top 250.#1

1203_4#The concept of this made-for-TV horror movie is ludicrous beyond words, but hey, it was the late 1970s and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable, so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog? The plot of  Devil Dog  is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of  The Omen  and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of German Shepard pups! Seriously, Im not kidding, thats what the movie is about! During the opening sequence, members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by Satan himself. Youd think that the Lord of Darkness has other things on His mind than to fornicate with a German Shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time, but apparently not. Exactly like little Damien in  The Omen , one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal. But Lucky  thats the dogs name  is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways. He also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children, but he cannot force the father (Richard Crenna) to stick his arm into a lawnmower because hes a  chosen one . The whole thing becomes too moronic for words when Crenna eventually travels to Ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect English. I guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life. Director Curtis Harrington ( Whats the matter with Helen ,  Ruby ) and lead actor Richard Crenna ( Wait until Dark ,  The Evil ) desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere, but all is in vain. Scenes like cute puppy eyes spontaneously setting fire to a Spanish maid or a dog dodging bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of frights, and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that. The  special  effects are pathetic, especially near the end when the Satan-dog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall.  Devil Dog  is a truly dumb movie, but its definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor. There are entertaining brief cameos of Martine Beswick ( Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde ) as the terrifying cult queen and R.G. Armstrong ( The Car ,  The Pack ) as the evil fruit, vegetable and puppy salesman. And, yes, that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her ice-cream in Carpenters  Assault on Precinct 13 .#0
12160_10#A vastly underrated black comedy, the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow Baby Jane. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to Compulsion) who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig (Im a Harlow, youre more a Marion Davies she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a deliciously funny tango and, over all, gives an outstanding performance, unlike anything shed done before. The atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie. It looks wonderful with great period detail (30s). Lots of lovely swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama coach Hamilton Starr, he purrs, two rs but prophetic nonetheless. See it and love it.#1
1245_7#Whenever I see most reviews its called a misfire for Eddie Murphy. These critics want to take a look at some of the stuff hes doing these days, and maybe soften their stance in retrospect  The Golden Child  is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clichés, and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I dont understand the pervading lack of love for its efforts, at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; its unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. Theres nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends. Yes its silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that ridiculous is where Hollywoods idea of mysticism begins and ends. Whats more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.#1
11753_10#hi Im from Taft California and i like this movie because it shows how us little town people love our sports football is the main thing in Taft and this movie shows just how important it is i personally think they should make another one but instead of actors use us kids to play the games well show you our determination weve beat Bakersfield every game for the past 6 years and since Im a senior next year its my last chance and then its college weve had running backs lead the state and Im next if you want to know me Im kyle Taylor and i average seven to eight yards a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard run so check us out at our website and go to our sports page bye#1
11448_10#I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in its initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom linenone of my friends walked away disappointed (ever!). This stellar film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye & ear (with an ambient musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,whos music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,seek it out (its easily a film that was composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)#1
3755_10#I remember this film from many years ago. Certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. The fact that I vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact.  I wish it would be shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it??#1
10186_1#Wheres Michael Caine when you need him? Ive seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-1st season flick (episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three  stars , Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever, delivering lines which must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research. Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8. Makes Logans Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I cant imagine watching it without the commentary of Crow and Servo since its unwatchable even with it. Clearly whats needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401K which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care. With its  rights to pollute and drive  theme, by the end, Im half expecting to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his  cold dead hands  speech. Lee, I could have forgiven you for this in 1989, but 1981?#0
4659_1#This movie is a waste of film stock. Do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this film. Do you believe that a DEAF person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in Europe during WWII to serve in a  Negro  unitcooking, supply services, burial detail, etc.? It happened in this film. Do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would select this same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the allies arrived? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier didnt realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers hold-up in a barn at a farmhouse that the Germans happened upon would SHOUT out their emotions at the sight of the German soldiers who were just 50 away? They did it in this film, and left any possible entrances to the barn the Germans might check totally unprotected. Would you believe that, over the airwaves and in clear English, the Captain mentioned the Generals rank, if not his name, as the person he was speaking with and that the general, in plain English over open airwaves, said that the dam had to be protected the next day? Maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the American attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the Germans. This so-called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films. If it were, Im sure it would do well. Watch it at your own risk.#0
2394_3#This movie was strange I watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. Im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high, but mushrooms werent enough. I couldnt stop laughing.. maybe lsd would work. The movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things, and dancing. Its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well one of a kind. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I didnt think it was very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time. If your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit, pop it on youll get a few laughs.#0
12029_4#Generally, Ive found that if you dont hear about a movie prior to seeing it on DVD, theres probably a good reason for it. I hadnt heard about this movie at all until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. Since all the good movies had already been rented out (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I figured Id give this one a shot. Admittedly, there were some very funny moments in the film, but I didnt think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall.#0
26_9#When I was a kid I watched this many times over, and I remember whistling the  Happy Cat  song quite often. All the songs are great, and actually memorable, unlike many childrens musicals, where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason. The scenes and costumes are lavish, and the acting is very well-done, which isnt surprising, considering the cast. Christopher Walken is very catlike, and doesnt need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe hes a cat transformed to a human. And Jason Connerys so cute, as the shy and awkward millers son, Corin, who falls in love with beautiful and the bold Princess Vera. This is a really fun, enjoyable, feature-length movie, where unlike most fairytales, the characters are given personalities. Some of my favourite parts are when Puss makes Corin pretend hes drowning; at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance, as its  all the rage abroad ; when Walken is in the kitchen, dancing on the table (hes a pretty good dancer, too!); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she used to do when she was young, like pretending she was a millers daughter. Id recommend this film to children and parents alike, who love magic and fairytales. And it actually IS a movie you can watch together, as it wont drive adults up the wall.#1
7777_10#Rich, alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy he stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stacks nymphomaniac sister, Dorothy Malone, lusts after Rock. Throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control (in a good way). Fun, glossy trash. Dont miss it!#1
1529_10#Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on TV now. The way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike todays shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side. The way marks brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking, and if you think you do, you are wrong. I just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so that i can watch them all in order. They seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit!#1
4562_1#I didnt feel as if Id been raped like I did with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS,but BELLES MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS,BMW hates its audience,although not to such an extreme degree. Its ugly,uncanonical,idiotic,and the writing is horrifically bad.None of the stories work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all,theyre a bunch of pod people. I wanted to dissect it,but after a few minutes,I gave up,because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously. What we have here are three stories.  The Perfect Word  is an overbearing,ponderous study of forgiveness.  Fifis Folly  only works if you can accept that Babettes name is actually Fifi and that shes a closet James Bond villainess and that Lumiere is an idiot concerning women.  Broken Wing  (or  Broken Wind  as I like to call it) is probably the most heinous of the bunch. Beast hates birds? Since WHEN? Dont watch this crap- every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic,a transcendent celebration of love,art, intelligence and the human soul.#0
7615_10#This show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television. I mean the acting is great, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story A plane crashed on an island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly is HOT  Matthew Fox once again shows us what a great actor he is, Josh Holloway is so great, Jorge Garcia is Hilarious, I could go on and on. Also, the unexpected plot twists, the back stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of every episode. J.J. Abrahms has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is. I mean this is better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. Whoever isnt watching this show, should definitely consider getting the DVDs and watching it, because they are missing something great. This show could possibly be the best show in television history #1
294_4#SHALLOW GRAVE begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in PSYCHO. (Im leaning toward rip off.) After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better, almost to the point of being original. Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the  Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks  genre because it is actually shot in the South. And in the strangest scene, Sheriff Dean makes like hes about to rape Patty (Carol Cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what hes about to do. The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible. His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. I feel sorry for this preachers flock. Jezebel was in the Old Testament a few thousand years before Christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in Heaven.#0
12332_3#The film looks super on paper. A romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross-breeding gold, especially with this excellent romcomic cast. Jean Reno co-stars amiably as the cop-with-a-heart and I guess wishes he was a star-with-a-part. Mind you he went on to do those Pink Panther remake(s!) so perhaps he was OK with this 3/10#0
9911_3#If you have beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobbs, you dont need Billy Burke, Coolio, or any other distractions. Massive talent is totally wasted in  Three Days to Vegas , with the blame falling squarely on the script. My neighbors vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie. If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script, check out  The Crew . There really are no redeeming factors here, and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the shallow script cheats the audience, by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with. - MERK#0
5483_2#I just blew four dollars renting this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me. But even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of Canadian newspaper critics gave this film. Im tired of our media justifying a film simply because its Canadian and low budget. Its like they expect Canadian films to be lousy, so they give it a good review regardless. A film shouldnt get special treatment just because its Canadian #0
12465_9#I definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film. This book won National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very gripping read (pun not intended). Its not too difficult to read for those out there that dont read often so dont be afraid! The book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book. Having grown up in Melbourne I could really relate to this book and movie. Very few Australian female writers were around the in the 70s therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in Australia during this era or class. Its a precious piece of Melbourne history. Its a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80s soft porn movie. Its far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the DVD jacket, it does not represent what the movie is about at all. Those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed. Just remember this movie was made in 1982, so dont expect the Hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days. This is what I like about it. Its also great seeing Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she is just fantastic as Nora and its great watching her really acting, for if youre close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew she hid this talent? This movie will give you an entirely new impression of her. A classic Australian Story!#1
8267_1#Im beginning to see a pattern in the movies I give a 1 to. They are almost all movies that my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste in movies. Anyway, this is typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls but done even more poorly than usual. Once again, the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie. He/she made the main character unlikable. She starts off by being a complete b tch to her friend at the beginning, and then finds out when she becomes 30, that shes basically a sh tty person (having affairs, etc.). Why the F would we feel for this person? OK, lets say we can get past that. Jennifer Garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity. I dont know if its her or the writers fault, but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance. Heres a tip for future filmmakers 13 year olds are NOT entertaining, theyre annoying. Far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to  Thriller . Holy crap that was painful. It showed her practicing that dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it, but an entire club full of people?!? Argh  The Macarena would be more believable! All of a sudden shes completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks character on  Big  had a job that made sense to a child. These body-switching/child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand, and this is by far the worst one yet.#0
7625_1#This is your only spoiler warning. What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered  Oscar worthy . The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT film rather than trying to teach WITH film. Two visually powerful downbeat films Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Rely on them, not this. Its the Last I want to see of it. 1 out of 5.#0
8829_1#This is an abysmal piece of story-telling. It is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about; the characters often mumble inaudibly; actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other; nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl; a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens; the Irishman gets punched in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason  to continue would be as boring as the movie itself. The only half-entertaining element is the landscape photography; but anyone could point a camera at the Australian outback a get memorable shots. Overall - dreary, incoherent, pretentious - and downright annoying for wasting so much of the viewers time.#0
9936_4#Picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market, was pretty excited. This movie is a good reminder that times really change,and what was important quickly becomes just plain silly. Good song, but it has now been played to death by this DVD.#0
2715_8#Q.E.D. was a brilliant TV series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for! I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982. I am eagerly awaiting its availability on DVD! Truly, Q.E.D. is a sad loss and, if it could be done with the same quality and values today, I would love to see it make a return.#1
7315_10#Classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis.      out of     #1
10188_2#This juvenile, bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens bodies, desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years. How ? By burning up gas and equating a fast, reckless car (or plane) with freedom. Even die-hard car-film and SF fans should avoid this film like month-old roadkill, unless you enjoy heckling Exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the heros gas tank.#0
10433_9#American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded. One of the best romance movies. 9/10#1
7526_8#Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With  The Notorious Bettie Page  she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America, an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner, are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Betties life were all the film was concerned about, then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in Americas attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, she accomplishes this goal admirably, holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own  enlightened  21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism, this is a film needed more than ever.#1
12063_4#The husband-and-wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, yet they made very few films. As is the case for some other performers of their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them, in which theyre portrayed by other actors Somebody Loves Me, starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable song-and-dance man Ralph Meeker. I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act. Now that Ive seen it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. My rating for this one just 4 out of 10, and Ill stick with Block and Sully.#0
321_1#Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with. I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didnt even have the guts to call it by its full name The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how low he can go.#0
12331_2#One of the those  coming of age  films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids. This movie has neither. It is a poor excuse to let Sylvia Kristels body double frolic with a dorky Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy, or dramatic. Laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard. Ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a body double. As the movie went on and on, I started to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had Sylvia Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP. Watch this to laugh at other peoples stupidity, or for Ed Begley Jr.s committed performance, or to wonder what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of your lesson, stay away from movies staring Sylvia Kristel that are not Emmanuelle.#0
11111_1#Do not bother to waste your money on this movie. Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you. If you must see a movie this weekend, go see Batman again. 1 out of 10, and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score I can.#0
5427_10#Three sergeants in the British army stationed in India, are sent out to stop an uprising of a tribe of murderers known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thuggees lead by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the regiments water boy, goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him, but are also captured. Now the major sends a full detail out after the three, but do not realize that they are walking into a trap set by the Thugees. It is though, Gunga Din who saves the day. Excellently made buddy film, even though it is today politically incorrect. Grant, McLaglen, and Fairbanks do give very humorous and thrilling performances with Jaffe very well in the title role and Cianelli very sinister as Guru. Rating- 10 out of 10.#1
2822_1#OMG this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot Im a Film student. I dont understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need the money that badly? I love AJ and have seen almost everything shes ever been in so i watched this 2 tick another one off. It was SOO bad! not even good bad, just bad bad. It had 1 or 2 funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes. I cant even say AJ looked good in it because well she didnt. The plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re-telling of Romeo and Juliet then its not. All round disappointing. Maybe if your 12 this could be a good film otherwise I really dont recommend it.#0

8097_7#Godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one, and probably the strongest kind that could be made about Ralph Bakshis take on Tolkiens magnum opus the Lord of the Rings, has actually been made by Peter Jackson. The recent trilogy, to me, arent even total masterpieces, but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post-modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good, sweeping entertainments.  If youre a fan of the books contemplating checking this out, I would say its worth a chance, even if its one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. As for it fitting into Bakshis other films Ive seen its an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement, where as with Lynchs Dune its bound to draw a dark, mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who dont. I dont.#1
2498_1#Forgive me for stating the obvious, but some films are good and some films are bad. Of course, there are extremes within those two broad categories. Films such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply dont deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally however, someone produces a truly woeful film. A film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be. A film that is more than bad. Such a film is Maiden Voyage. Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb. Said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard. What would you do? I dont know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as I possibly could into the sea. Not this guy. He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate (for him) results. Enough said. Such a demise would merit a mention in the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production teams lives.#0
6247_10#Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract audience. They are, of course showing the main message of the movie If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny, but this happens for real) and without any melodramatic, go watch this movie. However it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles I fear, as subtitles can t transport accentuation.#1
9561_2#Like many others have commented before me here, I have to say that this movie is bad, but not the worst Ive seen. There will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment, because I hate spoilers. To all who havent seen this one by all means, watch it and make up your own mind. But lower your expectations to the floor (and then some).#0
8895_10#I accidently felt on this movie on TV, and I wasnt able to leave it. Its really an excellent movie which makes people learning about americans history with the Vietnam war, the flower powers time, the racisms fight. It illustrates the conflict of generation, of political opinion, of race which took place in the 60s.Im born in 1980 so I didnt know all that stuff beforeIn france, USAs history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts ! By the way, I think all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry OConnell. Now I can see this film more then 1 time each day   Its really great. what a shame it only appeared on TV not in cinemas #1
7874_8#Madhur Bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today. The film has absolutely excellent acting by Konkana Sen Sharma, Atul Kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion. But the supporting cast is more than competent (Boman Irani is very good). This is what saves the film for me. Mr. Bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash. I wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively. He berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful. We have an item number in the framework of a Bollywood theme party, the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a Western beat. I hope the next one from Madhur Bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the Hindi film stereotyped ingredients. The film is a brave (albeit flawed) effort, certainly worth a watch.#1
478_7#Im rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in Luzhins game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. In between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after Luzhins combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by blacks rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus he is unable to play the purported mating move Rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but hes shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience.#1
10707_1#Where to start? This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The editing is the worst ever, the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked. Most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects, with muddled talking in the background. I had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on.and what was I supposed to hear exactly? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I cant believe people actually put up some green for this film. It makes me think I could take a crap in a box, send it to producers, and then have them finance a movie for me. Dolph, was a usual, Dolph. Nothing else needs to be said. The villains were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the movie was a stinker. If you really want to know what NOT to do when either writing, directing or editing a movie, watch this!#0
5499_1#I saw this bomb when it hit theaters. I laughed the whole time. Why? Because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane. I look back on it and realize there was not ONE funny thing in the whole movie. At leat nothing intentional. It IS awfully funny that Lizzie cn chew a piece of Nurplex and become a gigantic, carnivorous demonyet her itty-bitty little dress is perfectly intact, despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on. Or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious, and return to conciousness without ANY medical attention. And dont let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the  villain  that they decided they needed to create  conflict.  Uh huh. What a waste of the DVD format.#0
9109_7#Principally it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest, but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else, or they shows also the period before or after this fact, here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts. It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. The movie focalize to these two people, showing as normal they were, not like common heroes, because the revolution come from people. Although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just  capitaes  as the main characters. Nice colors and lights during the whole movie, excellent work for the director being her first movie, she doesnt fall to the banal way. Well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. The character of Maia (main one)is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, able to show Maias limits, this not-being an hero.#1
3328_3#Apparently theres a very good reason why I never heard about  Dr. Hackenstein  before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and stupidly decided to give it a chance. That reason is it sucks! Its a very pointless, dull, imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedy/parody. Actually, to be honest, Im not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late 80s horror effort. In the year 1909, at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences, Dr. Elliot Hackenstein needs exactly three women  no more, no less  to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed. Shes only just a living head left now, but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers. So when Dr. Hackenstein yells out  I need three female bodies to bring back my wife , his words arent even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females (and one really annoying nerdy kid) with car trouble show up at his doorstep. Why doesnt that ever happen to me?  I need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem    See, nothing! Anyway, the good Doctor sees his wish fulfilled, but unfortunately  for science that is  he develops sympathy for one of the three girls.  Dr. Hackenstein  is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of  Re-Animator  and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic, like a severed head talking one-liners. Its easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere, as it doesnt appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre. The funniest character is undoubtedly the loud-speaking female grave robber Ruby; depicted by the anti-cherubic Anne Ramsey. 80s horror buffs will certainly remember her from Wes Cravens  Deadly Friend , where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball.  Dr. Hackenstein  supposedly takes place in the early 1900s, but there are hardly any attempts to re-create the atmosphere of that era (except maybe for some automobiles). Dr. Hackensteins laboratory is a quite clichéd 80s set piece, with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors.#0
11692_7#Im not saying that just as a Chris Rock fan, Im saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong. The first flaw was its everything-works-out ending that everybody saw coming. Flaw number two was I found that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed fake. Finally the acting in this movie was sub-par, with the best actor being Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy. In a heads-up scenario, watch heaven can wait instead, its better. So for all you Chris Rock fans out there, WATCH THIS MOVIE, youll enjoy out. He has some good stand-up in this movie. Overall 7 out of 10#1
10837_1#I cant tell you how angry I was after seing this movie. The characters are not the slightest bit interesting, and the plot is non-existant. So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other, hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish, what do we get??? A storm of frogs. Now yes, I understand the references to the bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first of all, it was presented with absolutely no resolution, and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible (a significant portion of the population) or Charles Fort (a still larger portion). As a somewhat well read person, I thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode. well anything to be honest#0
12039_4#As was to be expected, A Mazursky film made in the 70s would be counter-culture, sympathetic towards the hippies - and have a lot of hippies in it - and, naturally, it is childishly anti-authoritarian (e.g. the scene on the Mexican border, when Sutherland provokes a customs officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he (Sutherland) has long hair). The constant left-wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had I not been prepared for it beforehand; Sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film, and most of these ideas are either about blacks or Indians (needless to say, he would be welcomed with open arms in todays Hollywood). One of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in Beverly Hills - a race-war, so-to-speak, in the middle of L.A.. This is the kind of nonsense that Mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies. Fortunately, some of Sutherlands hippie friends make fun of this black-revolution premise, and the resulting dialogue isnt bad; a little later, the Jewish guy makes a crack about Sutherland making a movie about  masturbation and the black problem , when the latter starts talking about masturbation. Another funny moment is when Sutherlands older daughter performs some PC crap on stage with her white school-mates, and they all say  We, the black people of the Republic of South Africa . There is always a certain amount of self-indulgence when Hollywood makes a movie about Hollywood - especially when its Hollywood making a movie about Hollywood discussing Hollywood doing movies. Now, thats very, very self-indulgent, indeed. The scene with Fellini (playing himself) is more amusing than annoying, though. Mazursky throws in the standard flower-children and anti-Vietnam bullshit into the soup, and also pokes fun at corporate Hollywood, but he was/is just as much a part of the  phony Hollywood  (lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment) as anyone else; I am pretty sure that he, too, makes phony small-talk in Beverly Hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesnt know or like, but whose money he wants badly for his next (left-wing) project. As for his hair he has the worst hair Ive seen in a very long time (on film or elsewhere); its sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle-aged accountant would have if he grew it long. The film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness, but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third. If youd like to read my parody/biography of Donald Sutherland (and other Hollywood actors), contact me by e-mail.#0
8796_8# The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture.#1
832_3#I give this film its props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted. BUt I couldnt get past the implausibility of the whole thing. the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous (like Network). This is neither.#0
7609_4#Being a big fan of Cormans horror movies I expected from his western a bit more than I got. Well, I was entertained all right. I had almost as many laughs as watching Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles. In the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all truly fine. A special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from Johnny Guitar, but doesnt quite impress the same way. But there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this. Just like a really bad old horror movie, it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway. That is one of the reasons Cormans work appeals to me and that is why I dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance.#0

7807_10#The performance of every actor and actress (in the film) are excellently NATURAL which is what movie acting should be; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again. However, I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director, Attenboroughs credits that puzzles me arent they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent, long lasting film for the audience? I am hoping I would get some answers to my puzzles from some one (possibly one of the  knowledgeable  personnel (insider) of the film.#1
5369_4#It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore, maybe to the MediocreLand?  PP  reminds me any one of the many tedious, promising at first but predictable within 1 season David Kelly flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so outlandish, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. And thats what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of,  This could be me  sentiment. They are not funny either. This concept might work with a whole new writing team.#0
9779_3#Relentlessly stupid, no-budget  war picture  made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer--not a bad idea in itself--but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it. Laughable  script , performances that wouldnt pass muster in an elementary-school Christmas pageant, inept  action  scenes, confused direction by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen--who is apparently not quite sure if hes making a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering T&A (by early 1960s standards, anyway) travelogue of Eve Meyers magnificent body--and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence. Worth seeing in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff, but thats pretty much it.#0
9874_8#In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin. This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supporting Oscar win the year before in  Johnny Eager.  The singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left a lot to be desired. It was a Gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer.#1

8200_8#Clint Eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this, but this one does not embarrass him. Dirty Harry catches everyones attention and unless one wants to watch romance, there is no reason why you wont like him. He is cool because he is dirty, is great because he kills without much thinking, is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesnt care. Based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all the  no non-sense  movie watchers. The movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot. However, what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of Eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not, as it is far too obvious from the beginning. It is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving. Also, there are too many people far dirtier than Dirty harry.#1
4344_9#The movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father. All of this happens amidst a road trip format. The backdrop is rural New York state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors. WOW!#1
3937_3#Its hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being at the top of the glory. Nine years later he is almost forgotten, and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably. I cannot even explain why, he is a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from. There is not too much to be told about this film. Its the only big screen film of Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. All is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex-doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob. The off-screen voice is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film. You probably will not meet the film but in DVD rental stores, or on TV. Try to look for something better.#0
11536_7#Its hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become, especially if, like me, you happen to like the TV show more. But theres a lot to be said for the source. Thats where Simons lines are so great. They are the underlying strength of the film. He gets the banter exactly right and real, and still makes it funny.  I dont mind you talking, Felix. You got things to say. Whats scaring me is Im beginning to listen.  The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better, in fact the TV show once made a good point about  assuming  anything at all, but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right.#1
6596_8#Brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve. Rather incredibly, Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (original title, which the producers discarded God Against Everybody) got very low GPA (grade point average) in this website. It seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large. Actually, it is not so brutal. I mean as far as graphical violence is concerned. Its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would-be lumpens, I mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment, who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of  grana graúda . Is this post-modern man? Is his/her only worry a quick, almost impersonal, ultra permissive lay, amidst over satiating meals ? The picture is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004, so far. Its shining editing style, à la Godard, its curious soundtrack counterpoints, its more than efficient overall cast and, above all, its original narration, with subtle non-chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue, deserve at least an 8 mark.#1

6494_10#This is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of World War 2 from the invasion of Poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945. Another worthy mention is the score, the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil, struggle and perseverance. Like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the hardship faced by the allies and the Germans during the war, its build to a climax at the end of every episode, which serves to layer the coarse of the second world war. After watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and astonished at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation.#1
9198_8#B Movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. First Movie? Yes. But Aestheically A+. This movie definitely had some bad sound/editing/lighting/acting/etc. etc. problems. However, this movie has many positive things about it. First off, the most annoying character dies first! Second, its made to be a parody/funny B Rated Horror movie. The comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing. The problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie. For what it is, just that, it is really good.#1
4732_10#Im no big fan of Martial Arts movies, but the video shop was nearly empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it free when the other films Id rented, either way I rented it. I absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22 year old Biochemistry and Accountancy students) spent the half hour after the film making strange Kung Fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other. I cant explain it (well maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, skinny bloke kicking big bloke, beating him, kicking bigger bloke etc film ends. Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.#1
239_7#I watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I didnt have the best time mainly because I didnt know about Ned Kelly or his story. Give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. Otherwise, I dont think I could recommend it.#1

8110_1#I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliffs Notes version of the Kundera novel and then set about making this film. Okay, of course it wont have the punch of the original. Kunderas novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs. This film does not even try! The one dream sequence of Terezas, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever. Also, and this is perhaps a lesser point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know its not really a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the Hollywood-izing of otherwise fine literature.#0
326_1#This early Adam Sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989. His characters constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as Big Daddy or even the corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. The majority of the films  jokes  come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because hes too ugly and cant get women. The film is hard to watch too because it doesnt treat itself like a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the films low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin Sandlers career. Pass this one up at the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.#0
12035_3#I expected this to be a lot better. I love Tim Burtons work, so I was really excited to see these online short films. Well, they werent at all what I had expected. There are some things that arent appropriate for kids. Just some language and gore. Thats about all I have to say! 3/10#0
11905_3#With a tendency to repeat himself, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with Paris Texas. Interesting that Wenders professed that while making Paris Texas, he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, that was Wenders best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter. His films from the past 15 years+ were a total mess.#0
4909_8#Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate (examble remember  The Savage Bees ? But Ill make an exception for  Tightrope , which almost got it right). One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good film to boot..#1
4049_7#Erich Rohmers  LAnglaise et le duc  makes a perfect companion piece to Peter Watkins  La Commune (Paris 1871).  Both films -screened at this years Toronto International Film Festival- ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale. Ironic, given the tragic events that were taking place in the U.S. during the festival. #1
362_3#Not to be confused with the Madonna film  The Next Best Thing ,  The Last Big Thing  is a silly, campy, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called  The Next Big Thing  which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. This low budget indie makes  Chuck and Buck  look like a masterpiece. Fraught with lousy acting, poor sets and costuming, etc.,  Thing  has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award. Pass on this one.#0

5232_2#Becky Harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously ONLY purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls! Miss Harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene. Once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no AARP queen. If these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid, I want someone to clue me in. Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and I literally wore out my VHS copy capturing her charms. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. The rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention. I was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent, however I was disappointed on both counts. God Bless Becky Harris!#0

5335_4#Its been a looooonnnggg time since I saw this comedy, and Id forgotten just how idiotic it is. Id place this easily in the lower two or three of Elvis Presleys very worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breed Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona and the broken-down shack where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night long. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandpa is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offer anything of substance , comically or otherwise. The government has invested in the familys cattle, but theyre lacking a bull. Elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs, and is pursued by a young boy-crazy gal and her gun-toting mother. This is just a real slapdash of a mess, and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and dont make this much easier. The one thing that puzzles me, however, is that Elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film. Hard to believe, considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies.#0
10476_9#My first exposure to  Whale Music  was the Rheostatics album of the same name, that I bought around 1993. I was reading the liner notes and the band said the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by Canadian author Paul Quarringtons book. Maury Chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius. The movie deals with family relationships, love, and finding someone who understands. I would strongly recommend  Whale Music  to not only music fans, but anyone who has ever lost something or someone, and tried to find their way back to the world.#1
2384_10#It is a well known fact that when Gene Roddenberry first pitched Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected for being  too cerebral . When the series was given another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon, and did so by writing The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still, at the time, an unaired episode. In short, not just a great  mystery  episode, but also a treat for those who cant be bothered to track down The Cage in its original form (its available as part of the Season 3 box set).#1
5465_1#This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen. It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps. The movie starts out bad (I would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1/10) and then it get progressively worse, minute by minute. The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety, long minutes. Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video. Somehow the video manages even to make cute, scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful. This movie is amazingly bad. I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over and with Buscemis character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in your ear than to watch this movie. The sequels are not nearly as bad. If you have to rent a Troma film, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I would rather watch 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than to see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again. Dont get me wrong, it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful, this is it.#0
6689_8#As a comic book reader, who still sees myself as a total kid at heart, I admit I might have been a bit biased towards this movie. I mean, there hasnt been a good superhero movie out for quite some time (NOTE Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read Blair Witch Project) I wasnt disappointed. I definitely recommend this movie. Although not an all-time classic, it is twice as funny as the latest Austin Powers retread. The writing is good, and the cast is GREAT. If youre worried, plan on the matinee and pay less, but either way youll be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us doesnt root for the losers once in a while?#1
8737_9#Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed Bugs Life a bit more. I cant remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and doesnt preach. The voice overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox#1
307_8# They All Laughed  is one of those little movies I am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past, but seems more contemporary. Even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesnt date it too much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet, that reality never brings it crashing down to earth. But, that said, this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going, and  TAL  is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale. It is a movie that wouldnt linger so long in the memory if it werent for the little moments provided by the excellent cast Colleen Camps simultaneously shouting orders at John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat; and especially the moment Dorothy Stratten falls for John Ritter and says,  Howweird.  Its such a piece of fluff one doesnt want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on ones face.#1
836_8#This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldnt come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, gone is the wooden James Bond (a role he was wasted in). If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnans straight man. Ive read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within. There are lots of good chuckles as Brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing. My father (a consultant) nearly lost it when Julian describes himself as a  facilitator . Much like  Grosse Pointe Blank , another hit-man comedy, the humour can be very dark. If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself.#1
5094_3#This movie sucked. The acting sucked, the script sucked, and the movie overall sucked. There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening. We gave it a 3 because we didnt feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)#0

811_1#The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and have watched it several times. And though I know that sequels are not usually as good as the original I certainly wasnt expecting such a bomb. The romance was flat, the sight gags old, the spoken humor just wasnt.

11384_7#The dazzling seventeen-minute dance sequence of George Gershwins 1928 orchestral piece,  An American in Paris , is an indisputable masterwork. Choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by Gene Kelly, the vibrant combination of color, music and dance is still eye-poppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists - Dufy in the opening Place de la Concorde piece, Manet in the flower market, Utrillo in a Paris street, Rousseau at the fair, Vincent Van Gogh in the spectacular Place de lOpera piece, and Toulouse-Lautrec for the Moulin Rouge where Kelly wears his famous white bodysuit. The 97 minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting, not by a long shot, but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire 1951 Oscar-winning musical. As Lise, the nineteen year-old Caron (in her first film) dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years. Looking quite glamorous, Nina Foch plays older as the manipulative Milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate, while Oscar Levant is just his sardonic self as Adam. Performing an elegant  Ill Build a Stairway to Paradise , George Guétary plays Henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end. This is not the best all-around MGM musical, but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile. The 2000 DVD contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras.#1

4963_10#Leave it to Braik to put on a good show. Finally he and Zorak are living their own lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I have to say that I love both of these shows a whole lot. They are completely what started Adult Swim. Brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000. It may not have been platinum, but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love Adult Swims shows. I have to say that out of all the Adult Swim shows with no plot, this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made. That is why I like it so much, it is just such a classic in the Adult Swim history. I believe this is just such a great show, if you dont like it. Hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it.#1
561_10#Anthony Manns westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart - in Manns films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER 73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a  I trust only myself  attitude, which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he (as Jeff Webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle).  Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by John Ford. Mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.#1
10739_4#Iedereen Beroemd has everything we can expect from a straight to video-movie. Its the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star. The only thing he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail. The problem with the movie is not the basic plot, but how it is made. Everything is supposed to be funny, but it isnt. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are shallow, and the end-sequence is totally without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing, but only at how pathetic the whole set-up is.#0

4206_1#I was at this films premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the writer/director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any. Rarely has a film been so poorly directed (why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes?), wretchedly acted (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional gamut from A to B. He parks at A and brings a lunch) and utterly pointless. Characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. At long last, the film comes to a completely random and pointless end thats supposed to  really make you think.  Unfortunately, what it makes you think is,  Well, theres 90 minutes of my life Im never getting back.  #0
2186_8#and what a combo. Two of the centurys great singers star together in this underrated musical. He writes music, she writes lyrics, and they both work for Basil Rathbone who cant write either because his wife died (actually she just got fat!). Best scene is the pawn shop number where Bing sings an impromptu number while the swing band gets their instruments out of hock. Just wonderful. And this is a rare starring role for Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and shes quite good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (once again the manic pianist), Charles Lane, and Helen Bertram co-star. And who knew Rathbone could be funny?#1

It starts very slowly, the backgrounds of the Nuremberg trials become clear step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but then, suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, the audience gets to see the most shocking, horrific footage I have ever seen. Im very angry.#0
9142_10#Purple Rain what else can i say, the title speaks for itself. But i think all the actors were well picked. The movie had a great story. I loved it! Ever since i watched that movie, ive been stuck in the eighties, and Im only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions, and the Apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand. Critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, he actually acted like himself. Im so glad Ive seen this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so heartfelt. I cried more than once.#1
6625_7#If youve ever seen the trailer for the film  The Recruit  with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, youll never have to see that film. Sadly, Renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers. I will definitely recommend Renaissance to friends. Its unlike anything Ive seen before, visually, and I believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience. It is also a watchable story, even if it isnt perfect.#1
11481_1#If they could get Ed Asner why didnt they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger. It forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability. I guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work. If the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long-distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better. He has good reason to be jealous, good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective, controlling manipulative father. All the characters that are meant to be likable arent and everyone else is the bad boyfriend. How did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a saw mill worker?#0
4778_9#Like his early masterpiece  The Elephant Man  Lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight, simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of an elderly retired man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at deaths door. A beautiful score from Badalamenti, exquisite photography of rural life (love those aerial corn-field shots), and a sly directors hand that reveals mans basic humanity, this is a beautiful slice of life film. Its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep, but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end.#1
1058_10#this is the best sci-fi that I have seen in my 29 years of watching sci-fi. I also believe that Dark Angel will become a cult favorite. The action is great but Jessica Alba is the best and most gorgeous star on TV today.#1
4747_1#I thought this movie was terrible. Im Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendys mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many of the actors and actresses were not very great. Some of the jokes that were supposedly  funny  were really stupid. I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get. Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.#0
2310_9#I was so surprised by how great The Man In The Moon truly was.I mean at first I was kinda expecting a cheesy, and predictable film, but I decided to put that aside when watching.Well, when it was over I was just left stunned(mainly in tears), by how great The Man In The Moon turned out to be.This movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone, and its just a fabulous film.The acting was great especially from Reece Witherspoon(who was so cute and lovable), and everyone else.There wasnt anything that really bothered me, I felt the ending kinda predictable, but very well done at that.Also I felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before, but still a great film.Overall I must say I dont to much to say about this film, not that it was bad, its just a film you either like or dont like.I would however recommend this to any and everyone, even if you dont like these type of films, its still an enjoyable film. 8.7 out of 10 stars#1
2489_7#Hugh (Ed Harris) is a hotshot, bachelor senator determined to run for president. One day, however, he happens upon an old high school classmate named Aggie. Aggie (Diane Keaton) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit. Hugh is smitten. He convinces Aggie to become his fiancé. But, will Aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics, where things are not always what they seem to be? And, will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz? This is, mostly, a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection. Hugh and Aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view. However, although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality, it doesnt completely succeed. Nevermind. The production values are high and the script is very elegantly written. With these advantages and the handsome personages of Keaton and Harris, those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment.#1
9543_4#Lets face it-- if you rented a STDVD sequel of a forgotten 80s gem, and expected it to be better than the aforementioned, then you are an idiot. Wargames The Dead Code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily. Movies like this dont need spoilers, because YOU already know them. Sadly, Mathew Broderick was too involved with some  masterpiece , that he couldnt even do a five second cameo in this one. But can you blame him?#0
3993_3#This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but also not that bad either. In my opinion PG13 movies arent scary enough so thats why I already knew I was going to be bored throughout the entire film. Sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we all havent already seen. I guess I didnt like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns happening; it got old and repetitive. I also didnt understand if all the things Cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about. What I did like was the special effects. Other than that there wasnt much enjoyment from it. Maybe its just me but I thought this was below average.#0
11567_2#I decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the BBC in the weeks prior to it starting. I watched it despite the fact that I dont like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry to his fans but I think we have a case of the emperors new clothes with this authors work). I admit that the acting is excellent, it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it - however- I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production. The explicit gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on TV - several times - so it was nothing very shocking Im afraid. Full marks for production values but low ones for storyline/content Im afraid.#0
12276_2#The movie had a lot of potential, unfortunately, it came apart because of a weak/implausible story line, miscasting, and general lack of content/substance. One of the very obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, didnt know how to pronounce his own Arab name! This may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details. The quality of acting was uniformly well below average.  Movies solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end; and a french song (I dont recall the title). Overall, it was a pretty bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly miscast.#0
1973_8#I never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film. That goes for critics as well. Sure, if it gets positive reviews thats OK and a plus, but most films that get critical rave I hate. I enjoyed this film for what it was, an entertaining film. It takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional characterthat being Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is awesome in this role, just like she was in the first one. Anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b/c she is back acting the same way she did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. Her one liners are great, much like in the first one. Who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops,  If youre gonna arrest me do itotherwise get the f  k out of here!  Great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this one. I was captivated by her. Her outfits, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, its worth the price just to see Stones performance. I cannot wait for this film to be released on DVD, uncut, because I can only imagine how much better it is going to be. And yes, there are lots of twists, as in the first one, including the ending #1
8783_1#I dont think Ive ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap. NOTHING in it makes any sense. none of it is clever or well thought out. out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop-out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothings there. thats OK to do once, maybe, but i counted three times. there are things thrown in for no apparent reason, characters, half-formed story lines. the characters werent well developed at ALL. the ending was.. bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component, of this film is terrible. and Im just here to warn you all of that.#0
9139_8#The movie is okay, it has its moments, the music scenes are the best of all! The soundtrack is a true classic. Its a perfect album, it starts out with Lets Go Crazy(appropriate for the beginning as its a great party song and very up-tempo), Take Me With U(a fun pop song), The Beautiful Ones(a cheerful ballad, probably the closest thing to R&B on this whole album), Computer Blue(a somewhat angry anthem towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki(one of the funniest songs ever, it very vaguely makes fun of Appolonia), When Doves Cry(the climax to this masterpiece), I Would Die 4 U, Baby Im A Star, and, of course, Purple Rain(a true classic, a very appropriate ending for this classic album) The movie and the album are both very good. I highly recommend them!#1
1260_10#The movie was a suspenseful, and somewhat dark, look at the severe results of a genuinely human mistake. Connery and Fishburne work very well together in this thriller about murder and redemption. Keep your boots on for the strange turnaround at the end of the movieyoud never expect it!#1
4274_10#I like this movie a lot, but its a fact, that you cannot understand it, unless youre from the ex Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegowina. Croatia. Slovenia. All of this was ex Yugoslavia, a melting pot of the Balcan nations. It could be a dream land, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists wouldnt poison the nations mind with their sick ideas.#1
5306_7#Saw this again recently on Comedy Central. Id love to see Jean Schertler(Memama) and Emmy Collins(Hippie in supermarket) cast as mother and son in a film, it would probably be the weirdest flicker ever made! Hats off to Waters for making a consistently funny film.#1
5656_10#I could never remember the name of this show. I use to watch it when I was 8. I remember staying up late when I wasnt suppose to just so I could watch this show. It was the best show to me. From what I remember of it, it is still great. This showed starred Lucas Black making him the first boy I ever had a crush on. I am from the country, therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me, but for him I would definitely make an exception. Which after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights, and Tokyo Drift you should see why. He is a great actor and has been since he was a kid. I miss this show and wish it would come back out. If anyone ever sees where they are selling the season please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com#1
3710_1#The king is dead long live the King! The triad of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king..yep..all hail the new king. Down to Earth . But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so bad they are good. Some day this could take out the inimitable  Rocky Horror Picture Show  as a cult film. So go see this .this.well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king #0
10054_10#This is a film.., not porn. Highly recommended for all film lovers.#1
8267_7#Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. We expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20s were a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the town nerd. The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports Its a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.#1
8070_8#I dont doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton, and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford wouldnt have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasnt. No split involved in his award. The Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time.#1
377_1#Dont even ask me why I watched this! The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. ) Its too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the Bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy, gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film. The script is dismal, peppered with clichéd lines,  Are you ready, Pardner?  purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims. Dire. Avoid.#0
4972_9#LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt Ill see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is set in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) for him. To do this the son has to break the record opening doors. What the father actually wants his for his son to be someone, because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called LEspoir (Hope). Of course nothing works out as planned. This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäkis DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker. Just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat, without being unrealistically happy. The humour is absurd, without making the plot unbelievable, and Mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting by Poelvoorde. This actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cult-classic CEST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were reprises of the Ben character. With his return to a leading role in LCA there should be no doubt anymore about his acting. Hes simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what hes done and be torn by remorse about it. A must see.#1
8357_10#A wonderful, free flowing, often lyrical film that whisks you along, ever smiling, even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way. One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well. This is possibly Depardieus best performance, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age. Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play. Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant/romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect.#1
688_9#I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film, Im very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture. Kudos to the cast for their terrific performances (that little girl was gold), and to whoever composed the music. The warped  Row Your Boat  blew me away. Very creative film all around.I really hope to see it come out on video or DVD because Id buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this film.#1
4995_3#I found it a real task to sit through this film. The sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie. These conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together. It is rare that I rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking  so what  and  why did I waste my time watching this.  #0
5544_3#While this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film, its surprisingly watchable on several levels. First, for old movie fans, its interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mick). While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 OCLOCK HIGH), here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair (I never saw him this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesnt mean he cant eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first movie (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. So, while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over-generous, its fun to laugh at and short so its worth a look for bad film fans.#0
1252_8#The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me. This truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my countrys behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement. We suck. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary Ive seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else hes done. My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inactionbut makes no suggestion of how to help. I dont know about Britain, but Americas made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their governments doings. A gesture in the right direction might help these islanders cause.#1
2985_4#When i finally had the opportunity to watch Zombie 3(Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe)on an import Region 2 Japanese dvd,i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is.The transfer is just about immaculate,as good as its ever going to look unless Anchor Bay gets a hold of it.The gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx.The sound is also terrific.Its only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2,you can really appreciate the cheesy music(actually a very good score),and the effective although cheap sound effects.It never sounded so good,and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment. Tons of action sequences,exotic locales,excellent set design,good,sometimes great cinematography,wonderfully cheesy acting,and inconsistent but still interesting plot,great makeup effects,beautiful women who can kick butt,excellent music,and sometimes hilarious,sometimes creepy,but always entertaining zombies.How can you go wrong with this film,it has it all,a cult classic that stands the test of time.#0
4968_1#I was expecting the movie based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the Beowulf epic, but told from the perspective of the monster.  Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.#0
5608_1#I was curious to watch this movie. A lot of people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ but Im opened for any kind of views or opinions. It doesnt matter for me, if Jesus existed in the way its written in the bible. If Maria was a virgin or not, or all the other similar pagan coincidences. What matters for me is the idea of salvation, the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world. What made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence, present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written. For example, they showed in this movie following sentence big  Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me  Jesus (Lukas 1927) What they didnt tell you is the context. Jesus told a story about an evil king. There is no passage in the bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! After quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people (pseudo-christians) filled with hate. The majority of viewers dont check the informations presented so they start thinking Jesus=hate=not good for me or for anybody else. This is pure manipulation people. Please use your brain. Dont take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie. We destroy our own basis, our civilization if we start dismantling Jesus in this way and the message he brought to us. You saw off the branch youre sitting on.#0
10086_2#I remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager. But i wanted to see it again, because Traci Lords is now earning a living as a  serious actor . What the hell was going on in the eighties? This is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors. Definitely a waste of money.#0
10553_1#I bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it was all about. I thought  hmmm, a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore . It wasnt funny alright. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I dont mind disturbing movies but this one just didnt mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm The quality of the images were terrible. The actingthere was no acting. Just some fcked-up fcker mutilating himself for over 90 minutes. This is probably material for sickos jurking off on extreme gore. They should mutilate the guy who made this#0
2874_1#This movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured. Theres male full frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, the female loosing control of her bladder. All shot in a gray cold color. Effective, but a little too much. We then move on to seeing the BTK killers youth as well as the present and his history of crimes. The tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and its creepy. Here we dont see fancy or good imagery, it looks as if shot with your home camera. It doesnt look horrifying, but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling. What this movie doesnt have is any drama, really. There are some cop scenes every once in a while, but theres no excitement in terms of them finding the killer. There isnt much of an arc to this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage. Its dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again. Sometimes you dont know its coming and dont have enough time to look away. And that I have to reject. Im all for low budget horror movies but I dont tolerate animal suffering. It was unnecessary, excessive, and comes without warning. Im glad that Lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does, but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore. Stay away from this garbage.#0
4312_4#This one acts as a satire during the womens rights movement era. Of course, that doesnt mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold. It runs into the same vein as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still tame), and is basically standard fare fluff. What I mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize. Anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste. Its the same feeling you may get after watching this. A nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a mans duty, but I expected better things.#0
9785_3#This film, for an after school special, isnt that bad, and thats the problem. Nothing happens. You feel as if youre still in class. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players. We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them. They all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating. Also there are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids. This could have had a Bad News Bears feel (the original) since there was a girl on an all boys team, but there wasnt any feel to this movie at all. It has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it, is not fun to bag on, not fun to watch, and is just kind of there. Plain. Boring. Something youd watch after school before your pre-evening nap. As dull as the day is long and its been a long, long day watching this movie.#0
10121_3#Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money go traveling. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). But, they remain as boring as they were before. Arguably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeares  The Tempest )  Rich and Strange  by ordering up some camera trickery. An opening homage to King Vidors  The Crowd  is the highlight. The low point may be the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat.     Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph#0
3520_9#This is a  B Series  Film Noir, and my vote reflects its membership in that genre. I saw this film last night at a left-bank cinema in Paris, where it opened a two-week film noir run. The film has some flaws, yes, but far too many delicious elements to ignore. However, its the gorgeous Ella Raines who, in only her third credited performance, held this viewer entranced throughout the film. A  Girl Friday  type with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, its a wonder that she didnt become a household name. But shes so good here that Ive just ordered another film of hers (Impact) off the Internet, and I cant wait to see it as well.#1
29_4#I cannot stay indifferent to Lars van Triers films. I consider Breaking the Waves nothing less than a masterpiece. I loved Dancer in the Night. I admired the idea in Dogville but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical, less cinema. Europa which I see only now was a famous film at its time, succeeded in the US the relative success of an European film and got the Oscar for the best foreign language movie, but did not survive well the time in my opinion. It is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste. It is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case. The actions of the characters, especially of Leopold Kessler played by Jean-Marc Barr seem confused, and lack credibility. The overall cinematography seems to be not Hitchcock-like but rather from a bad imitation of Hitchcock in the late 30s. The usage of color over the black-and-white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative. It is not that Van Trier does not master his artistic means, but he is too demonstrative, he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is. He really is great, as he will show in some of his later films, but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone.#0
1663_9#I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter I had never heard of before. So I set out exploring her life and work afterwards. As could be expected, I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. I was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a film isnt and shouldnt be a biography (nor a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right. A film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a wonderful film and I think it brought many people (including some that now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.#1
2413_10#Love the TV show. Was hooked first time I saw it. Wish I was there acting in with them. It touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with, then at a turn of events that you meet someone else and that person is more of who you want to be with. You are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other. Someone is going to get hurt, theres no stopping that. Making the decision is hard but, do you want to go on being unhappy when you could have been. Why go on and live a life that you thought that you wanted or thinking you are doing the right thing and you both be unhappy. That other person isnt going to wait a life time waiting, they have a life a well. Making the decision that you really want will be better in the end. Making the best of what you have is a good thing a well. Money, cars, houses, etc.dont make you happy, having the one person that you really want to be with to share it with does.#1
439_9#The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way (note that this change need not be positive or beneficial) at the end. By that measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success. As a film in general, it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast, well-developed characters you come to care about, wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations. In short the film is, well, enchanting. Although all the performances are first-rate, three must be mentioned-Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast. Most highly recommended, particularly if you are a romantic at heart.

9883_8#It ran 8 seasons, but its first, in early 1959, and its last, in the autumn of 1965, were shorter than seasons 2-7. CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhides production after watching the 1st show of season 8, in September, 1965, because he disliked the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who had departed after season 7. The last new episode aired in November, 1965. The lone 1966 CBS broadcast, on January 4, 1966, was a rerun.  I have often wondered why Rawhide didnt switch to color filming for its last season? Most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965. CBS was broadcasting in color that autumn, for many of their sitcoms, but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and last prime time network series to switch to color) on September 17, 1966, for the episode Snap Decision.#1
10176_7#Tim Krabbe is the praised author of Het Gouden Ei, a novel that was put on the screen twice (Spoorloos and The Vanishing). One of the Dutch writers more recent works is De Grot, a psychological thriller about two totally different men, Egon and Axel, who meet at a youth camp and, surprising enough, become friends for dear life. Egon is a quiet, somewhat dull person, who spends his time studying and writing geography books. Axel, on the other hand, is a charismatic party-animal, a heavy drinking criminal whose everydays concern is to get a woman into his bedroom. From the moment they meet, Axel has a strong influence on Egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything (such as reading thick books like Egon); ultimately, Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian country. 7/10#1
309_1#Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandlers film career but was digitized after a short time. Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and failsor so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leones favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard aint Dooley squat! End of file.#0
7201_8#Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas. Cant say much about this film without giving away the story. I can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture. Everybody has his or her own agenda. Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances by all.#1
9379_1#This movie . . . I dont know. Why they would take such an indellible character as Pippi Longstocking and cast the singularly charmless Tami Erin, I will never know. Why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects, then not bother to edit it properly, I will never know. Why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period, and sometimes bizarrely not, why they commissioned SUCH bad songs, why the script doesnt make any sense whatsoever (not even on a silly, childrens film level) . . . . what were they thinking?? Nothing about this movie is quite as it should be. Every single part is dubbed (and always poorly,) every sound effect is slightly wrong, every edit is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. It does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it NEVER captures the magic that is Astrid Lindgrens creation.#0
548_7#This movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart like Winchester 73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along. It starts out with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arriving in Seattle and Stewart is charged with murder. He is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but Stewart only cares about getting his cattle back. As the movie goes along its like Stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the Naked Spur. It gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in Alaska. This is one of Stewarts better westerns.#1
4800_3#If you made a genre flick in the late 80s, you basically had a 50/50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison (sadly, we never got an underwater prison flick). Framed for murder by mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends up on death row, right alongside the mob boss brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the least of Dereks problems as rogue government agent (and mob stoolie) Col. Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus. This is the only flick Saxon directed during his storied career. For a guy who has worked with tons of directors, it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheap-o Italian ones. Sure, it is low budget, but that cant excuse the stilted staging, shooting gaffes, or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene (our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist). Cole, who looks like a more rugged Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as the stoic lead and Franciosa - sporting a really bad rug - gives it his all as the cliché mob boss. The end takes place at Marty McKees favorite location, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.#0

2855_4# Mad Dog Time  Trigger Happy  whatever you wanna call itsimply doesnt hit the mark. Maybe its just me, maybe i just dont like Gangster comedies ( as i thought Oscar , Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked ) Its probably more  witty sharp wordplay  than all out Comedy, only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )Make it out to be.  4/10 I dont think ill return to it anytime soon.#0
9389_4#According to IMDb, as well as to every other website that holds a review; this  thing  doesnt have a director. Well, that would surely explain a lot! Just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra-thin storyline about devil-worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium.  Hardgore  is a prime example of totally demented 70s smut, as its really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration. Horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70s and pornography as well, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl whos committed to a mental asylum, and from the first night already, shes drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. Really, a LOT of dildo-action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has her throat slit even the same night. The horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated, going from laughably un-scary Satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks. The photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish, but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm-firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs? Leading lady Justina Lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body, but most of her co-stars (male & female) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls.#0
2908_3#Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez and it might be brilliant literature, this cinema-adaption really sucks as its more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices. The story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight. I am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece, just perhaps that you can see Salma Hayek in here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that? No gracias..#0
1175_9#Match 1 Tag Team Table Match Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley vs Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley started things off with a Tag Team Table Match against Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit. According to the rules of the match, both opponents have to go through tables in order to get the win. Benoit and Guerrero heated up early on by taking turns hammering first Spike and then Bubba Ray. A German suplex by Benoit to Bubba took the wind out of the Dudley brother. Spike tried to help his brother, but the referee restrained him while Benoit and Guerrero ganged up on him in the corner. With Benoit stomping away on Bubba, Guerrero set up a table outside. Spike dashed into the ring and somersaulted over the top rope onto Guerrero on the outside! After recovering and taking care of Spike, Guerrero slipped a table into the ring and helped the Wolverine set it up. The tandem then set up for a double superplex from the middle rope which would have put Bubba through the table, but Spike knocked the table over right before his brother came crashing down! Guerrero and Benoit propped another table in the corner and tried to Irish Whip Spike through it, but Bubba dashed in and blocked his brother. Bubba caught fire and lifted both opponents into back body drops! Bubba slammed Guerrero and Spike stomped on the Wolverine from off the top rope. Bubba held Benoit at bay for Spike to soar into the Wassup! headbutt! Shortly after, Benoit latched Spike in the Crossface, but the match continued even after Spike tapped out. Bubba came to his brothers rescue and managed to sprawl Benoit on a table. Bubba leapt from the middle rope, but Benoit moved and sent Bubba crashing through the wood! But because his opponents didnt force him through the table, Bubba was allowed to stay in the match. The first man was eliminated shortly after, though, as Spike put Eddie through a table with a Dudley Dawg from the ring apron to the outside! Benoit put Spike through a table moments later to even the score. Within seconds, Bubba nailed a Bubba Bomb that put Benoit through a table and gave the Dudleys the win! Winner Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley #1
11659_2#I  loved  the original Scary Movie. Im a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. I think the Wayans are a family of comical geniuses. Alas, even geniuses make mistakes. As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give this one a 2 out of 10.#0
11373_8#Heres an oddity a modern-day film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes, nobody seen dying, no car chases and no loud noises..and it takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes but they are horrific. Otherwise, its an intelligent and refreshingly low-key crime film. This is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well-known but is well-liked by the people who have seen it. Since its based on a true-life account of this killer, its all the more chilling. Dont pass this by just because you havent anything about it.#1
928_10#I had watched as much of the series as I could manage to watch on television, but unfortunately, started a job that got me working evenings. I managed to catch some recordings of it, at least and, of course, purchased the recently released DVD of the complete series. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first, but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done. The voices are well suited to the characters, and the writing is excellent. Its rather refreshing to see animation getting back to its roots by reintroducing adult themes. Thing is, with the way society has come in the last century, you need to be a bit more blatant about it by todays standards in order to be recognised as an adult-oriented show. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life. Its your typical sitcom in that regard, but the humor is more like what youd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or Saturday Night Live back when SNL was actually funny. Good job, Dreamworks. Perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray its high costs. Its a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though. Hmm#1
5874_10#this move was friggin hilarious  funniest Ive seen in a while, akshay and john kick ass as always, and the chicks are hot too. the story is awesome, lots of great jokes, and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot. to him i say that u are not of Indian background so u wouldnt understand the humor u moron. dont rate movies u dont understand. what did u watch, the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation? thats what i thought jackass.  akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility, he can do not only action but comedy as well, and is excellent at it. john has proved himself as well, this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it.#1
5651_10#It was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the show were great as well, and complimented one another well. I was sorry to see it cut off.. I would have loved to see where it could have went.You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was frightening and alluring. And I would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. I will however buy the show just to enjoy, it was great to something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was Calebs cousin, she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to Lucas. Its a shame it isnt around still.. or was never finished, i would have loved to see what would have happened.#1
8812_3#Unfortunately, the realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes. Wheres Blade when you need him? While as dismal as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as nightmarish as BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES isnt nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies. While the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe Jeffery Dalmers hearts race a little faster, it wasnt nearly as interesting as RAVENOUS. Really, I found it about as interesting as late-night infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you might be able to endure this, otherwise, for no one. I was really surprised that this one wasnt made by the people at Brain Damage as that was the quality of Dead Creatures.#0
636_4#A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the leading roles, talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and land are the best things for men to have. They are seen as property and investment. Because it is a big budget movie, in which many extras cooperate, big sets are built and special effects take place, the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the movie. Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance, showing his talent ones again. Another problem with the movie is the ending. It seems like Franklin did not know when to end the picture. This film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of Chinese culture and traditions.#0
7909_10#When this first came out, my dad brought it home- we were amazed by it- It was so different from anything we had seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night, and I found  The Minds Eye  again. The box is falling apart, and I am surprised that the tape still works! Although it is not Finding Nemo quality graphics, it is still very good. They should sell this again- it is a landmark for computer animation imagery. Highly recommended!  The Minds Eye  joins the imaginations of over 300 of the worlds most talented computer animation artists with a powerful, original music soundtrack. This unique collaboration takes you on an incredible voyage into  The Minds Eye.  #1
4559_10#My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyones jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film. My point Parents of young children, i suggest your children watch this movie with you, so theyll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they dont stare at them like theyre aliens. My sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people, that people who might not seem  normal  are people too. 10/10#1
2270_9#The movie is a bit  thin  after reading the book, but its still one of the greatest movies ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really  vonneguty . He makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film. Not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as Mother Night does.#1
593_9#This game show lasted just one season, but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand. One false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize, even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer. It was always exciting as the contestant began drawing, wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out; allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest. It was a light-hearted show, but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally. Rarely seen, the game show did not survive past one single season. Only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show, as it proved to be quite unpopular, even though game shows were making a big return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950s game shows. But it was a unique concept for a game show, and one that has as yet never been seen again.#1
7890_7#Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film to feature Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or a co-star). The years of killing have taken a toll upon the town of Springwood. It has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price. Only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But that doesnt stop Freddy from seeking out his final revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time he finds out a little more about his old life. Can the kids finally stop Freddy for good? What is this secret that is buried in Freddys twisted mind? to find out youll have to watch Freddys Dead. the end was originally filmed in 3-D. I have to recommend this movie for Freddy fans.#1
2289_9#Im a rather pedestrian person, with somewhat lowbrow tastes. However, I occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my attempts. I was in awe throughout the entire movie. I liked it so much that I got my own tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie. I saw it as a huge question to the viewer What is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept, can be asked to accept, should accept? As a military member, this is of course an important question to me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie. Recommended.#1
1291_10#This is a good movie. Something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate, especially from a kids point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a kids dream coming true, and what a kid might do with $1 million dollars. Dont like it, dont watch it. They make movies for the watchers, not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives.#1
4591_9#Its depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up. He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts. To be fair, hes now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. But with Rush Hour 3, where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker (of all people!), and then theres Kung Fu Panda where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement. So Police Story is a blast. As is the case with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new  Wow!  factor is added to the action.#1
7581_2#I saw this movie the other day in a film school class, and I hadnt seen an Almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together dont add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all. There is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. And thats it, thats the only entertaining moment. The rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than self-indulgent trickery for a movie to be good.#0
1841_4#This could be looked at in many different ways. This movie sucks, its good or its just plain weird. The third one probably explains this movie best. It has strange themes and just has a strange plot. So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be. If not for Christopher Walken and it stupid ridiculous ending I would have given it a lower rating. He is always quite a character in his movies. Stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really dont go anywhere. Not completely horrible but I would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie.#0
12346_1#This films basic premise is a political cartoon. I suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a  feel-good  film on gender equality. Indeed a recent commentator stated  it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do.  What claptrap! No one, man or woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore  buffing  up for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD/S program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL is simply not going to make it so. There is approximately an 80% dropout rate in what is arguably THE roughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily drop out, cant compete on a physical level, suffer frequent physical injury during the training or cant handle the psychological harassment. I never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived, purported message of this film. In the real world, Demi wouldnt last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training. Wishing alone wont do it. Skip this film as wishful thinking, and better spend your time reading  The Warrior Elite  by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001)for the best description as to what really goes on in this training. Ring the bell, Demi! #0
7806_10# Cry Freedom  is not just a movie. It is a historical account, heroic story, and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating, determined hero, Steve Biko, but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his main  influencee , Donald Woods, is a heartbreaking one. But, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa.  Cry Freedom  manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. It is because of great films like this one, that the public can become educated on terrible events in history, great leaders who sought to end them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. Because of this importance,  Cry Freedom  is an amazing film that should be seen by all.#1
9818_7#Robert Culp (they call his character  doctor I think hes a vet or something) and family move to an affluent, low-tax, zero-law-enforcement suburb. Lantern-jawed Culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and  go cruising  through his front yard at 60mph. He presses charges, which arouses the kids ire, and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign. Unfortunately, this was a 1973 made-for-TV movie that I just happened to catch at 4am on my local WB affiliate, and its probably not destined for DVD release. But after being inspired by this film, do you think Im gonna just sit here and take it!? #1
11571_1#This film is just another distortion, among many distortions, on the so-called sins of consumerism. Please note that Reverend Billy, an actor (Bill Talen), is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the sins of consumerism. We might want to ask are questions, like What does Reverend Billy do for a living? How does he make his money? Does he make his living off his tax-deductible organization? How does the Internal Revenue justify this as a tax-deductible church or organization?  It has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions, but I pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs, values, and perspectives. But, as far as the distortions expressed, within this film, I do not have any faith in such beliefs, values, and perspectives. I rank this film with a 1 out of 10--but, in all honesty and truth, this film deserves a zero. This film has no integrity, and I cannot recommend it.#0
1272_7#Enjoyable movie although I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it. It is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why Elly is such a recluse. Then, when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isnt much detail. Perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something. #1
766_10#This started out to be a movie about the street culture of the Bronx in New York. What it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life, for American youth. What other movie has done this except Rebel Without A Cause? One of the most important movies of all time. The elements are simple yet fascinating. The story is timeless, young people try to succeed against all odds. Yet the story is always believable and never depressing. The characters are so realistic, a city dweller, would recognize them as neighbors. The story is entertaining, and comes to a satisfying ending. Buy this one for your permanent collection. It is a piece of American history.#1
10213_1#A lot of people seemed to have liked the film, so I feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review. But after sitting through 96 minutes of it, I feel I have to do so. Where the heck is the plot in this film?! I must have missed it, I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened. Sure the ending was  somewhat shocking  but they didnt build up to it. I forgot who was who half of the time, so they didnt really develop the characters. The acting was so-so, most of the time it was believable, but I was able to see through it most of the time. So without giving anything away, I must say that unless you like the actors in the film, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be mistaken, but I just didnt understand why there was so little, or too much of the film. I cant decide which one that would be, so I say judge for yourselves. I dont even know if renting it would be a good idea, the cost and all  Plot 0/10 Characters 1/10 Acting 2/10 Overall 3/10 I feel like thats too high really, I am staying with my vote up at the top.#0
3386_9#Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973. Lets hope that the world isnt going to end up like this An excellent 70s Science Fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy.#1
10238_10#People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this movie is no exception. Some movies I love did poorly at the box office but, Im glad to say, this movie isnt one of them (over nine million dollars, which I dont think was bad for back then). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated movie. I didnt think Professor Screw Eyes or his  Scary Cirus  was too scary for little kids (the targeted audience for this movie), but I thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years.#1
11208_4#Raymond Burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his affection for his friends wife (Angela Lansbury). This was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting. A few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for TV.#0
3917_4# The house of the spirits  is quite awful. I live in South America, in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe, and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality, this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid. Things are not so simple and linear as appears here, and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in  The house . If you cant show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all. There are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema, without so many commonplaces. In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your publics intelligence.#0
7801_1#I will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right up there with Schnaas other horrible zombie entry - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH!T 3). These films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot. I somehow managed (barely) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so horribly inept - even when compared to Schnaas other horrible film - that I had to fast-forward through everything after the first 10 minutes. ZERO acting skills, inept gore, horrible camcorder-style camera-work, ridiculous dubbingit just goes on and on. I really cant find a single thing redeeming about this garbage - and I can usually find SOMETHING redeeming in just about ANY film. This truly is one of the worst films ever made - Youve been warned1/10#0
5284_4#This production never really got off the ground for me. The plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless youve read the novel or seen a better adaptation (like the 1995 one with Amanda Root) youre going to be a bit lost since theres no time for character development. My other problem with this version was the lighting. Sometimes everything looked like a scene from the CSI morgue -- very very blue. Other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well, like when Anne visits her old school friend, Mrs. Smith (who, by the way, is supposed to be more or less paralyzed. Having her run up to Anne on the street to tell her of Mr. Elliots awful character was such a violation that for a minute I couldnt think who she was -- I thought she was one of the Musgrove girls. And she might as well have been. All the girls were pretty much interchangeable). And the running scene at the endin an era where propriety was at a premium, its hard to imagine gentle Anne tearing all over Bath like some demented hoyden. How silly can you get? Its too bad. Sally Hawkins had all the makings of a good Anne Elliot, but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an over-truncated production.#0
2307_1#I was true to my regard for Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. I watched the entire film with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the movie was about. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts. It was a poor way to spend an evening.#0
12140_8#  SPOILER ALERT   W. Somerset Maugham classic on film about a love obsessed young man whos abused hurt and humiliated by the object of his obsession to the point of losing everything he has only to find true love in the end under the most unusual circumstances.

In the end Mildred got back just what she gave to the kind and sensitive Philip She became both unloved and alone. Philip found in the sweet and caring Sally everything that Mildred wasnt and in the end also found the true love that he was looking for all of his life.#1
4332_10#Paul Reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It is worthy of an Academy Award. This was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year. Reisers wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running TV sitcom  Mad about You . Peter Falk did a masterful job as his dad, and Peter who is now 78 years young made us laugh and cry at the same time. The supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. It is a must see movie for 2005. We bet that everyone across all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie. We have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different.#1
8688_8#A very high-standard Columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long-running series but was originally transmitted second (after  Murder By The Book ). Overall, this is a very fine piece of detective work for Columbo, and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to render a polished Columbo story.#1
7068_3#Chillers starts on a cold, dark stormy night as a bus drops off three passengers outside a bus station, a young boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a college professor Dr. Howard Conrow (David Wohl) & a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside they discover that they have missed their connecting bus & are stranded for the night. In the waiting area they find two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) & a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons) who is currently having a terrifying nightmare I am sure a lot of effort was put into Chillers as a low budget film & at least the filmmakers tried so I will give credit for that at least, but that still doesnt stop me from thinking its crap. Similar anthology films like Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), Dr. Terrors House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) & Tales From the Darkside The Movie (1990) are far superior to Chillers so watch one of those instead.#0
2596_1#Dear God! I kept waiting for this movie to  get started  then I waited for it to redeem itself and when it did neither, I just sat there, dumbfounded that 1) it could possibly be this bad, and 2) that I had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity. I had faith that Drew couldnt possibly have made this bad of a movie and boy, did I ever lose my faith! Dont bother with this one! Drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, poorly acted, and just poorly conceived! I cant believe a script this bad ever got funded! It had a million chances to actually do something with the idea, (the word  concept  is too big for this movie to even qualify for!) and it STILL didnt go anyplace! Its just pitiful! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasnt the worst, baffles me! Because believe me, if it got any worse Id have slit my wrists before finishing it #0
8680_9#Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market. This market is essentially dominated by the Looney Tunes and the Merry Melodies shorts, coming from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able of releasing hidden gems, like  To Spring , an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year. In conclusion,  To Spring  is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era. What is even more remarkable is that this cartoons director made his debut here. And who is  To Spring  s director? Its a certain William Hanna#1
9792_8#Once a year  comes  a movie like that and makes things easy for you. You dont have make an effort to think it is good, its just is. You enjoy it while you watch it, and you take it home with you. I cant say it is totally flawless, but its near. Acting - great, story -interesting and with elements of suspense. Its a small family story, pretty much predictable, but its not the secret itself that matters. it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it. I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I didnt like that much is the actress that played the mother, she was too tough and without necessity. Keren#1
10044_9#Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game. If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes. #1
4528_8#Although the movie is clearly dated, audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless Buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale. Buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages the Stone Age, The Roman Age, and the Moden Age, playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different  ages . In this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the  caveman  stereotype, who wins his love not by romance but by brute force, as well as a funny twist on Roman gladiatorial combat, two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as Mel Brooks  History of the World Part I . The underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing Although the times may have-a-changed, we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to  win the girl  (keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 America, a time when chauvinism was still en vogue). It is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movies  modern times  to now.#1
2834_1#Ive now watched all four Bo Derek vehicles directed by her husband, John; all are quite terrible, of course, but this is certainly the pits. Featuring the usual flimsy plot, bad scripting  by the director, naturally  and acting, not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star, it deals with her losing much older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired Hemingway ) but who continues to appear and talk to her. In fact, he wants to come back in another, younger bodybut actually does so only in the very last scene! Derek is lovely as always, and still playing naïve(!)  especially during a muddled mid-section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa. Quinn, too, is typically larger-than-life (read hammy) here, but this easily constitutes his nadir; besides, for much of the duration, he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic (presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo)! His replacement, then, is obviously a handsome-looking stud who hasnt a lick of talent or even personality. Also featured in the cast are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinns best friend and Bos business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinns guardian angel in the afterlife)  plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who presumably needed this on his resume)! It also goes without saying that John Derek was his own cinematographer on the film, that the end credits are filled with useless (and corny) expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand, and that GHOSTS CANT DO IT swept the board at the 1990 Razzie Awards!#0
2191_10#Shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage. But when this stage is Israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style. Dan Katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but besides, Katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the Israeli people and, this people, far from being simple prominent figures, they speak to us from the heart. Katzirs film allows Israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live, and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes. It is very great for me because the reality of state of Israel, which the Europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers, appears as a close and absolutly human reality, the reality of million people who looking for his place, exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it. Katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thank you Dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world.#1
4840_4#This whole film should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept/theme, it really did not develop as a story. Once the initial idea of a brave (stupid?) bomb disposal expert (cowboy?) are introduced, and this happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitious. Characters were not explored, and aspects of the location and politics were ignored. There was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe. But the way in which the unit operated stretched belief! Individual performances were good, and special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content.#0
4462_9#One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh features several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi conducting, and much more. The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath, through transparent keys, and Grayson singing, seen through the finder of another camera. The plot is thin, but you get involved from Kellys & Sinatras enthusiasm. Sailors on leave, they have to take home a runaway boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls for his aunt. To set him up with the aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatras young and naive in this one, and in his own sung words falls in love too fast. While theyre trying to contact Iturbi, whos never available, he starts to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kellys now falling love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live-action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but theres a lot more here thats worth a look. Im giving it nine stars because, while its not quite as good as the best musicals - Singin In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - it is one of the first of their class of Technicolor big productions (perhaps Meet Me In St. Louis was the first), and better than most others.#1

7954_7#Great voices, lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie. The addition of  character  to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning, particularly the relationship between the older fellow, Shadow, and the young hellraiser, Chance. The earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive, which is done perfectly here. Sally Field is lovable in anything, but really shines in this film as the proud feline, Sassy. Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life, and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent. Theres even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids. Hats off to Disney.#1
6054_2#Im not sure if Carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion, and make the really heavy-handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if Satan is the father, but it drags on and on. Ron Perlman is laughable. The baby is really stupid looking, basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it. You can pretty much see the material on the Satan costume. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of story and 55 minutes of tedium. Very, very bad. And the ending is just ridiculous. After learning his baby is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody, gory, uproar? NO! He just puts his head down and sulks out of the room. Terrible.#0
7078_9# Twelve Monkeys  is odd and disturbing, yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. It cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films. All in all,  Twelve Monkeys  is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from Willis and Pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot thats so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewers attention by making it interesting and witty. Its also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so its all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures Ive ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really, but thats how it is, its mind blowing.#1
6406_4#An update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th Century. Its a string of several jokes acted out. Some of them you could tell your Grandmother, some of them not, but its a fairly safe bet shes heard them all before. For what it tries to be, its not too bad. Before you rent it, remember that its an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation. Robin Williams has a couple of bits, but hes interchangeable with the other players.#0
995_3#Rosario Dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. While its clear why Dawson took the role, its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent, decidedly un-Hollywood film, its also clear that aside from stunning good looks, Dawson seems out of place in the role. Forgive me I simply couldnt find her. Thats not a mistake, thats how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes I know shes on the screen but even though I spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. I blame the script for this since other than the ending, not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. The people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didnt seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, other than the end (which I would love to talk about but cant cause it would spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me.What can I say, this may click with you, it may not, for me its time I cant get back. For Rosario Dawson fans only, though be warned theres several real reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario- please, youre a better actress, pick better scripts)#0
1961_9#Just came back from the first showing of Basic Instinct 2. I was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct I think you will enjoy 2 just as much if not more. Great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. The music is superb, reprising the originals theme. Dont go expecting Academy Award material, go to see it for enjoyment and fun. Thats what movies are designed for -- escapism. I cant think of a better way to escape than to escape with Sharon Stone who is as sexy as she ever was. Am thinking about going to see it again this weekend. Go see it!#1
10173_8#RUMORS is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring  Private Snafu.  The films were aimed at servicemen and were directed, animated and scored by some of the top talent from Warner Bros. Termite Terrace, including Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, and Carl Stalling. The invaluable Mel Blanc supplied the voice for Snafu, and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by Theodor Geisel, i.e. Dr. Seuss. The idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery, using the character of Snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope, the little twerp who would do everything youre NOT supposed to do. According to Chuck Jones the scripts had to be approved by Pentagon officials, but Army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes, certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow-- all for the greater good, of course. This is a highly effective piece of work. The filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy, and the message is still a valid one. In recent years weve seen that catastrophic events (real or imagined) can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances. Because the technology has improved, the Private Snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e-mail, cellphones and blogging. Consequently, RUMORS is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesnt feel at all dated; in fact it may be more timely than ever.#1
6214_7#Plot is never the strong point of a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, but  Follow the Fleet  s screenplay is exceptionally mediocre. Fred and Ginger still come off all right--they play  Bake  Baker and Sherry Martin, dancers whose personal and professional partnership ended when Bake joined the Navy. When they meet again, their love-hate relationship generates some entertaining comic moments. But for much of the movie, they take a backseat to a tedious subplot about Sherrys sister Connie (Harriet Hilliard), her love for sailor Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott), Bilges dalliance with another woman, and an old schooner that Connie inherited from her father. Though Hilliard is rather charming, this plot is uninteresting. It would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of  Follow the Fleet  again, and, in fact, its not necessary, because the plot rarely propels the musical numbers. But I could watch the songs over and over.#1
5543_7#Very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty-row film company PRC who usually put out really cheesy films like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. German expatriate director Wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his studio-bound swamp set. Gaunt and ghoulish Charles Middleton is effective as the Strangler.#1
352_10#I just saw  Valentine  and I have to say that it was the best slasher movie that Ive seen in years. Unlike the recent trend of 90s horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking. For those out there that hated  Scream,  there is not one reference to  the horror rules  in this movie (even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here).  Denise Richards stands out here as a fun character. You can tell she liked her role, and that makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.#1
24_1#I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one. Edward Furlong, youre not as good as you think mate, you cant grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap, which sole intention has to be to get some bucks. vote 1/10 (my first one)#0
9490_1#This is complete and absolute garbage, a fine example of what a BAD movie is like, this cant be appealing to anyone, not even b-movie fans. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash. Bad acting, bad directing, horrible (but I mean really horrible) script, and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment (of any form) is. I bought the DVD for 3 dollars, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. I like b-movies, the killer toys, the weird lagoon monsters, but this is nowhere near. You know those movies that are so bad they are funny? Not even. Just plain old pathetic.#0
8644_7#     = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten I almost feel like Im cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving  KALIFORNIA  a     rating. But the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it. I do believe that everyone should see this movie though. I truly do.#1
8240_9#I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto. This film was sort of a consolation when I thought I wouldnt be able to get in to see my first choice. Well, I was totally blown away. By the time I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was even in it.) Terrific performances from the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I think not since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever. The kids were also great. Definitely check this one out if you get the chance. And, by the way, I got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better.#1
3903_1#Emma is my favourite Jane Austen novel - Emma is well-meaning despite her flaws, so readers can forgive and love her, and the relationship she has with Mr Knightley, which is warm, familiar, respectful but playful, generating that warm, fuzzy, romantic excitement. Mr Knightley is the perfect man, and Emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent, clever, confident woman - remember, she is only 21, and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws. Who doesnt want to be Emma? Who doesnt want to be told off by Mr Knightley? This version of Emma gives you no sense of the things that I love about Emma. I couldnt even finish watching it, I just found it so awful. I couldnt see that warm, generous side of Emma, which drives the reader to love her The patience and warmth she shows to her father; the closeness between her and Mrs Weston, which demonstrates her willingness to put her friends happiness above her own (as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding Miss Taylors marriage). Mr Woodhouses character in this adaptation just appears bizarre, rather than just quaint, elderly and a bit trying. Really horrible. I cant understand why anyone who truly like the novel Emma could like it, unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point I switched it off.#0
5942_7#I really liked BATMAN DEAD END, I thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance Collora could make a fine film. This trailer didnt quite give me the same impression. The story line, or potential story line, was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good TV movie or television show. All in all it was a good trailer. Id probably pay to see a film, if ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television. The story line, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous of Loiss attraction to Wayne, Lex and Twoface teaming to beat Superman and the joining of forces between Batman & Superman is a good one. Im sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film Collora and company, even OHearn could deliver a decent film. Certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of Hollywood lately.#1
8478_1#This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever. The acting was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any upset emotions. At the beginning of the movie, she was supposed to be discouraged. Instead, she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out. She sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene. I was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to pluck out her. Everyone else was suffering from over-acting as well. It was flat out annoying. It was also an insult to figure skaters. Jordan took a month to train, and they cast her as a person who makes the Olympic team. Its practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work. A pitiful excuse for a movie, and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating. Dont waste your life. It doesnt even deserve one star.#0

6273_9#I really loved this film, yes, I know it was fairly far fetched, there is no way that Shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all its traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the Brit Bad Guy, he was a little  too  much dont you think? Anyway, great film, great cars and great acting. I for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night. )#1

11151_3#DarkWolf tells the tale of a young waitress named Josie (Samaire Armstrong) who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend Mary (Tippi Hedren) is killed by a Werewolf, you see Werewolves actually exist in modern day America & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the Werewolf threat headed up by Detective Steve Turley (Ryan Olosio) who has the difficult task of telling Josie that she is in fact a pure blooded Werewolf herself & that a so-called dark prince Werewolf (Kane Hodder) wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood Werewolves that will take over the entire world, or something like that. Understandably Josie has a hard time believing it, that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes. Its up to Werewolf cop Steve to save Josie, the day & the world DarkWolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves & clutter the schedules of obscure cable TV stations, I didnt think it was as bad as some but its like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said & done theyre both horrible still#0
4939_7#This movie is not great, but it is a good and enjoyable one. It feels like an indie film made out of a play script. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears the script was not written for him. And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasnt committed to yet. I mean, he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it ) Bottom line a nice little film, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and a few extras, dialogue driven, makes Morgan Freeman look good )#1
4129_1#After watching about half of this I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I endured to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is poor---much worse than the acting in 80s T&A movies. Dont waste your time watching this.#0

5307_7# Pecker  is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star in the public, the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all-day life just as dirty underwear or human excrements. Its a typical topic of John Waters Baltimore-based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the American way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative backlashes by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown. Edward Furlong of  Terminator 2  fame plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Waters long-time actress Mink Stole. Although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and cant compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Waters brilliant  Serial Mom , its still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie-girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish  Pecker  is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, media hypes, middle-class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it.

6464_9#Wow I loved this movie! It is about normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It is about things everybody encounters in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and what will the neighbors think more important than to follow their heart. Dont let anybodys opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could have been my family. No big beauties, but all people you fall in love with during the movie.#1
6339_1#All of David Priors movies are terrible on all counts bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the directors brother is usually cast as the male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. The plot of almost every David Prior  film  (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Manly all-American commandos team up to blow up Communist baddies. But unlike other Cold War-era garbage such as Red Dawn, Priors movies are actually funny because of their over-the-top premises and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was is the other dude?) is being summoned by General Mitchell for a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something to the effect of  this is my roommate, I trained him well . WHAT. You trained your roommate? And apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction. If you can find these gems on video used anywhere, BUY THEM. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K-style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get a hold of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka  Killer Workout . But the one I recommend the most over them all is Final Sanction, with the freakish-looking Robert Zdar.#0
11171_7#Overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most everything is correct. The movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts. I found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie (because I hadnt found out about the movie yet) but later I found the movie in a bargain bin at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what I had expected. Overall I give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall making sense) and for its bad parts (large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies).#1
11766_8#This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions,shootouts,bad guys and worse guys. It is fun to see James Belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss  The Skipper. Does this sounds cheesy. Of course it is. But boy,did I have fun watching this movie. It is a whole lot better than all the direct to DVD garbage that is made nowadays. If you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store. You could argue about the twists being predictable. But the fast pace of this movie doesnt give you time too think too much of them,which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist. But more about the journey to that moment. Only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie. They probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other. Pure fun #1
8880_8#Of life in (some) colleges. Of course there were artistic licenses taken, but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges. So is  Higher Learning  overly dramatic? Exaggerated? Maybe. Is it way  off mark?  It depends on where you went to or go to school. The race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own DOES happen. Minus the Hollywood exaggerations, the race thing hit pretty close to home for me.#1
11019_4#Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director, even as far as B movie directors go, but Haunting Fear is probably one of his better films. Yes, it does butcher the great Poe story Premature Burial and yes, it is badly paced and uneven throughout, but it is also pretty entertaining. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies, actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress. You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes. The ending didnt make much sense!#0
10842_7#So I rented  Still Crazy  instead. When I described Hardcore Logo to the guy at the video store, he said that sounded kind of like Still Crazy. So I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well, yes, as Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band, but thats OK. Still Crazy tells the story of the Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival. Twenty years later, the band members are all struggling to make a living, and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival. They take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis, touring Europe in the process. Some quite funny hijinks ensue, and all the characters go through subtle changes. Watching this movie, you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And thats not bad at all.#1
4859_1#Youve got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, theyre probably all crap (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch). Finally, after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives, and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly once was enough, Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again?#0
4728_8#After seeing Break a Leg in Vancouver at the release party I thought it was a very enjoyable film. I highly recommend Break a Leg.#1
5325_7#The idea of making a film about the Beatles sounds doomed idea, as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic Beatles. Then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available Beatles material. This is exactly what Birth of the Beatles offers to us, the simple story known to us without any extravaganza. The guys who play the Beatles in this production scarcely look like the originals, but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate. The guy who plays Lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either. Brian Epstein is great and the moment when he sacks Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film. Also as a bonus you get to see the original Cavern club in the film.#1
10589_10#I enjoyed Longstreet, which followed in the steps of Raymond Burrs successful Ironside TV series and was intended to give it competition. But this show was canceled after one season because it was decided--I believe wrongly--that Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr. Burrs Ironside. Writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on TV.#1
9563_3#This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80s hit . Its set in the modern day as we see a base in Afghanistan get destroyed by a UAV right at the start. If you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. This is an awful movie and is best avoided.#0
10528_3#I picked this one up because the music was done by Hans Zimmer, a customer of Metasonix modular synths (made by someone dear to me). The jacket art says  the 2003 version . The sets were marginally impressive-that is, rich peoples houses in L.A. and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was. I found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around. The wind wasnt fierce enough to be believable to me. I kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nastyetc. and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding. I stumbled over things like why did she light a fire, blow out the match, then throw the match into the fire?! Dumb stuff like that. It was clunky at best. Oh well. Robert Morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it.#0
7794_7#Victor Nunez imbues this unsentimental tale of a young womans emotional journey with a sense of poetry seldom seen in cinema. By poetry I mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if a novel has been adapted page by page to screen. In this sense, the film achieves depths many cannot; but it is also rather slow at other times, undercutting the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui. The films star Ashley Judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here. She fits the role of lead Ruby like a glove, almost as if she didnt have to act. She has true movie star presence in the film, and hasnt really managed to convey the same allure in her later films, although she was impressive in Normal Life.#1
5222_8#After Chicago, I was beginning to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then along came The Flock. Theres just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you, but he proved to me that hes finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also super as his  trainee/replacement . Some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence, but I dont see it that way. Nothing I saw detracted from the power of this film. I was really shocked I hadnt heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at Blockbuster instead. Really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action, suspense, thrills, and social consciousness. As good as 7even? Well, maybe. And youll see better acting out of Gere than anyones ever gotten out of Pitt.#1
1788_3#Giving credit where its due, only the technicolor, costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention. Summing up Dull as dishwater. Not recommended, even for children.#0
11130_3#Despite having known people who are either great fans of Noam Chomsky, or think hes a tired relic from the 1960s, I really had no opinion of the man, save that I knew he gained fame as a linguist, although I could not elucidate any of his theories, and that he was a liberal socialist with Marxist leanings. So, stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky Rebel Without A Pause, in a used video store, a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11, I decided to get it, just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person, pro or con, spoke of him. While glad I got the film, my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was, so whats all the fuss about? In his simpleminded world without grays, Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco, whom he reviles, are; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals. In short, Chomsky is a man living in the past, in over his head on most issues, and out of his depth intellectually. Near this films end he warns, Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice, yet one can only laugh, as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didnt like, no matter how barbarous their crimes, and anti-intellectual their posit. Please, pause before you waste your time and money on this silly, and already irrelevant, DVD.#0
7274_10#No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencias best performances to date. Mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues. However, he does more than that in this stand-up performance, which took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencias material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today. If you enjoy this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, his show on Comedy Central.#1
12191_7#The Lady From Shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director, Orson Welles, whose last Hollywood film this was for many a moon. Its a kind of post-modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular, and it concerns a happy go lucky Irish sailor (played by Welles) who falls in with a mysterious lady (Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time), and her crippled, and probably impotent husband, played with a brainy, malevolent gusto by Everett Sloan. A long sea voyage follows, with Welles in tow as bodyguard, and the plot thickens when Sloans law partner (Glenn Anders) turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown. A murder plot ensues, and all sorts of calamities follow for Welles and his employers, and at this point the story, fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far, goes off the deep end, and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set-pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not, by itself, possess, and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess. There is a question that nags me about this film what was Welles trying to say? He was a highly talented and intelligent man, and tended to make statements in his movies, which, whether one agrees with his world view or not, were brilliantly put forth. I think I have an answer, or a partial one Welles was summing up his movie career. He had reached the end of his rope in the Hollywood studio system he despised, and he knew it. The Lady From Shanghai isnt exactly a nose-thumbing at the studio moguls of the day, but I suspect that it is, in its portrait of amoral, rival big shot lawyers (read producers) expressing Welles opinion of the power brokers of Hollywood. That he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling. Welles himself was certainly an inveterate traveler, and he rarely lived in one place for long. He was hired by a studio to provide it with a big, prestigious film (Citizen Kane), which caused a firestorm of controversy from which he never fully recovered. This may be the issue that dares not speak its name in this film, which is to say Welles personal failure in not getting over the shock of his newness in the movie colony, and his inability to deliver the goods, as promised. The mere fact of him turning up in Hollywood, like his mere presence in the film, could not forestall disasters well beyond his control. That he presented himself in the movie as an amiable, naive outsider shows a lack of self-knowledge on Welles part. He was much more of an inside player than he let on, and I imagine that he despised his knowledge of the worldlier aspects of life, and himself for knowing so much.#1
9806_8#I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I cant believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudsons flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didnt care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should have lasted longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America.#1
8640_4#I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here. It was fairly easy to watch (at 3am). It had good casting - Kevin Dillons role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling. The rest of the main characters werent so bad either. Try looking around at the other channels before watching this.. But, if nothing better is on, Id give it a try.. =)#0
7216_1#I love Westerns. I could watch them all day.  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  is my all time favorite. I watched  Silverado  for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is without a doubt the worst Western I have ever watched. The acting was terrible all around. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing. The only good part I can think of is the good-looking cantina girl. The very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length. This movie wasnt even worth the new rental fee I paid at our local movie rental store. I felt like I was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing. Only reason I finished it was because I hate to not see a movie through to the end. I turned it off half way through because it was so bad. To the director, please do a better job if you decide to make another. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to Westerns.#0
11078_10#I watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away. It is a real masterpiece of art and I dont understand why most of the people think its garbage. The main idea of the movie - take your ego away and then you will have true power! This was the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way.  The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look  - do you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego That voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give, but only to take, that creates our aggression, that wants to be in control, that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance. A superb movie #1
9892_8#This movie is such cheesy goodness. If you like cheesy 80s slashers (like Pieces) then you will like this one.#1
5798_8#I first saw this when they showed this around easter time 1993/4 and didnt think much of it then, I bought this on DVD last summer when I started getting into Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and enjoyed it more now I am older. It is a good film but it wont be this classic film like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard Of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. There were a disturbing scenes like the little girl Katie getting slapped by the gangster Frankie Lideo who was played by Joe Pesci. The scene that frightened me when I was younger was when Michael turns into a robot. My favourite song on the film was Smooth Criminal I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion.#1
11152_10#Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time, and I have watched it several times since.  10/10#1
11307_1#The Perfectly Stupid Weapon. I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segals movies was intented to mock Jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. The plot is predictable, the fights were fair and Jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene.#0
3112_2#Let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this. Normally I enjoy Robin Williams movies, however this gem was not one of them. It was billed as a suspenseful thriller. The night listener was anything but. To be blunt there were 6 people in the theater opening day, 2 walked out, for good reason. The movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed. The acting was alright but again there wasnt anything to work with. The movie is about A storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid. However  insert spooky here  no one can verify the kids existence. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker. There thats it, thats all. You wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends. It had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit. The homosexual undertones, or overtones had really nothing to do with the story, and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense. In conclusion i really cant write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it, it was as captivating as watching paint dry. I gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it wasnt directed by Uwe Boll.#0
3191_1#There are movies that are awful, and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long-forgotten and unwatchable. Also, lots of violence and bad stuff (not just cheesy stuff; you know what I mean) add to the mix as well. What is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content? Why,  Final Justice,  of course!  P.S. If you have a Big Lots nearby, check that store for the uncut tape! LOL That happened to another user #0
8159_1#This is only related to the first movie by the name. The plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks  I have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad. Avoid this at all costs, the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick and so is the fourth but this one and the 3rd are rubbish #0
1330_9#How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad, scary and life-affirming. It ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen, even though you were hoping--maybe even beleiving--it wouldnt. I saw this in a film theory class at USC back in the mid-90s. It is not easy to find, but is definitely worth hunting for.#1
7594_2#Given the history of the director of this movie, it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through. I was at the European premiere last night and one of the Executive Producers was there. He was yet to see the movie and, boy, was he in for a surprise. I have not read the book that this is based upon, nor do I know if it highly rated or appreciated, but I have read  Captain Correllis Mandolin  and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was, I can only presume that something similar has happened here. The acting wasnt bad albeit that there were a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly, I cant believed how little I cared for any character in this movie. Situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. Donald Sutherlands part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch when I wasnt cringing at the dialogue on the screen. I have never walked out on a movie but I was tempted to start during this. I gave this movie a score of 2 for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful. I can say little else positive about this movie. Dont ask the dust anything, it cant talk #0
7494_2#That word True in this films title got my alarm bells ringing. They rang louder when a title card referred to Americas Civil War as the War Between the States (the circumlocution preferred by die-hard southerners). Jesse James -- thief, slave-holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet, gentle farm boy. The True (not much!) Story of Jesse James is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer, and likewise dishonest about the Civil War. For the very impressive stunt work, one good montage and a few fine acting turns, Ill rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10.#0
3427_8#This film illustrates the worst part of surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women alike, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from WWII. For one of my uncles the war was never over. He survived the D-Day invasion, something akin to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him the memories not only lingered but tortured him. He became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins, his sons. Jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw this at the KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change. The idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right. The tag line from the Vietnam war film Platoon says it all.  The First Casualty of War is Innocence.  #1
4507_3#Despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Not on the payroll apparently.  Sowatching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or Japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making. They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong. I thought  The Last Samurai  was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on Japan could be. Memoirs of a Geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.#0
6775_3#I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far whats not to like? Its the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a turkey on their hands, and whats the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of rapport between the characters. You have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but its understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-rehearsed. Quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery. I have to say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker. Whats to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking the film is nice to look at. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant cant look elegant in his. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogans Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!#0
11477_4#Sorry my fellow Nevada City neighbors, but this one is bad. Sorry.#0
12351_4#A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background, contained the comment  A womans life is no more valuable than a mans .  G.I. Jane  is Hollywood fluff.#0
5210_2#First let me be honest. I did not watch all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on It didnt. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become a decent horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. This film isnt and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you wont need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung.#0
10655_9#It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach. Unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help. John Sturges short movie (69 minutes) is powerful because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price she has to pay for this. There is a double question the movie poses. How far would you go to help the man that you love, and on the other hand - observing Stanwycks behaviors towards the stranger - does she really love her husband? Like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself.#1
2942_1#This is hands down the worst movie of all time. A combination of Whoopie Goldberg (the worst actress/person in history) and a talking dinosaur ala Jar-Jar-Binks add up to a painfully bad movie. That was an understatement. This movie is unwatchable. For the love of God, do not watch this movie.#0
3795_9#After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldnt wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the films fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of  real teen life.  Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt,  a film teens should see because its about them.  Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like  Pups  or other radical modern teen films--and McKay seemed responsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic.#1
8576_8#Hollow Point, though clumsy in places, manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie. Oh, by the way, advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie#1
5853_3#THE IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. It certainly didnt kill me during its hour and a half duration, but it didnt impress me much either. A group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants (in a scene featuring cinemas least convincing head crushing sound effect) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant an old persons brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the producers heads. But the production literally doesnt have the guts to pull it off. Ive never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror film, that they dont pack it to the edge of the frame with gore. The acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as the assistant Dr. Price. He has a nice evil laugh. The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks.#0
308_1#Mere thoughts of  Going Overboard  (aka  Babes Ahoy ) make me want to weep. Throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie. Its not even a supposed  so bad its good  movie. I would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people cant see it. Oh the pain, the pain#0
2417_1#This was without a doubt the worst thing I have ever spent money on. I feel dirty for admitting that I rented this movie and actually paid money to see it. This does not even rate trash. No no. This is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer. To call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere. It was so bad I felt I had to register at IMDb and warn my fellow man. This luvahire character claims this movie is great. One has to question his grasp on reality. Lets take some of his comments and analyze them. The potential renter whose interest has not been quelled, should find the following blurb on the back of the video case  The Quiroz Brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting. --Mr. Bangla#0
3377_2#The Broadway musical,  A Chorus Line  is arguably the best musical in theatre. Its about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience, and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer is auditioning for parts in a Broadway chorus line, yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite.  There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film. If you want to see a film version of this show, the next closest thing is Bob Fosses brilliant  All That Jazz.  While Fosses daughter is in  A Chorus Line,  HE is the Fosse who should have been involved, as director. He would have known what to do with this material, which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort.#0
8149_10#I first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is STILL funny. I dont know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90s, but it helps if you do. In the 90s when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc). Also there were the wanna bs, accessible rappers that start making the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C&C Music Factory, etc). This movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like its an actually documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff/director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott/Revenge of the Nerds, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial. Whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it. But, if you know 80s/90s rap, you know how much of this stuff is true. Still, on its own, without hip hop knowledge, it is still a funny funny movie. And for all of those who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie either. This, in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways, better than Spinal Tap. As Spinal Tap is to heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is to Rap. And the songs are off the hook also. The DVD is chalk full of extras to include music videos of NWH as a group and as solo artists. Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.#1
6330_1#If you enjoy the original SNL cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs. When this first came out my friends and I waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house. half way through the movie the theatre was 3/4 empty. We refused to leave thinking it would get better. When the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre. The movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight. In interviews with  Mr. Mike  he refused to comment on this film. The film was an inside joke on the episodes of SNL that came out right after the films release and closing in one day. We all tried to contact  Mr. Mike  by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored.#0
9625_8#On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob. Lexa Doigs character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart. Dean Cains performance was an usual excellent. He gets better with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide#1
6534_10#I had heard this movie was good from a lot of my friends that saw it, and they all said it was amazing, so I had very high expectations- and Nancy Drew exceeded those high expectations! It had funny parts, it kept me entertained with the action and all the dudes trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing as Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was very good, also. I would definitely recommend this movie   ~Nancy Drew#1
9043_3#I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son. He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and I did. The writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention at all. The movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that I was hoping my son would fall asleep so I could pick him up and walk out. Not to say that the film isnt an interesting concept, its just told so oddly, (bad screenplay?) especially when we  meet the family  for the first time. I know were supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord, they couldve shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, I didnt actually time it). By that point I was scratching my head looking for an exit.#0
3187_1#From the Star of  MITCHELL , From the director of  Joysticks  and  Angels Revenge   These are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie. And the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true  Ugghhh Joe Don Baker eats every other five minutes in this film. Its like a bad remake of  Coogans Bluff  #0
12297_7#Anna Christie (1931) Clearly the themes--immigration, wayward fathers, daughters turning to prostitution, and the troubles of finding true love--have strong currents back then, especially with European threads (Garbo, appropriately, plays a Swedish young woman).#1
4583_1#If you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch  Waking Life,  which is brilliant.  What the $ ! Do We Know  is all over the place in its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acted, utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying. It wasnt thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. The inclusion of that rambling freak  Ramtha  in this film is reason enough to avoid it. Isnt it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old Atlantian god or something? What a flake that old chick is, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. The people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.#0
3600_7#At first glance I expected this film to be crappy because I thought the plot would be so excessively feminist. But I was wrong. As you maybe have read in earlier published comments, I agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman. Its like Guzman is presented as somebody with a spine, this in contrast to her classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was quite good, except for the predictable end. Maybe it wouldve been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist, so that the viewer is somewhat more surprised. I gave it a 7 out of 10, merely because of the dull last half hour.#1
11863_10#Perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if its not its certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what Brian De Palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork. First there is the directors touch of Brian De Palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever, there is the superb performance from Al Pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are the many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one with the chainsaw, the one in where Tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most peoples living rooms), there are the many superb one-liners (count how many times the word  f ck  is used), there are the superb little details (the Pan American-globe that screams  The world is yours ) or the great discomusic from Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named that isnt sublime here and it easily is along with  The Godfather ,  Good fellas  and  White heat  one of the best gangstermovies ever made #1
5672_1#I am ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most redeeming factor to owning the DVD is the short film in the bonus features. My vote for this movie is a big fat ZERO. Dont misunderstand, Im a horror girl. but i want some meat behind the story, not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans, not to be tricked in to watching, what seemed like forever, clips of animal snuff. Acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting. If i was forced to make a comparison to another film, the only one that comes to mind is Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch.#0
1462_1#This could well be the worst film Ive ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this movie isnt even close to being historically accurate. It starts badly and then its all downhill from there. We have Hitlers father cursing his own bad luck on the  fact  that hed married his niece! They were in fact, second cousins. Hitlers mother, Klara, called his father, Alois,  uncle  because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klaras grandfather and brought up as his son, when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and so as a child shed got into the habit of calling Alois,  uncle.  Give it a miss.#0
12179_8#I happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels. My expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie.In A Guy Thing, Jason Lee plays Paul, a straight-laced, Seattle-based fellow who is about to marry his fiancée Karen (Selma Blair) and settle down to an unchallenging life of middle-class domesticity. We first meet Paul at his bachelor party, where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his (surprisingly few) buddies encourage, in case hes a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife. Of course, the next thing Paul knows, its the morning after the night before, hes in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law phones to inform him that Karen is on her way over. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karens cousin Becky (Julia Stiles). From this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune, as Paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure, trying to cover up what hes done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful, family-oriented good guy, whos super-excited about his forthcoming nuptials. His efforts to ensure Karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrong-doing on his part ironically forces Paul closer and closer to the fun-loving Becky, forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him. The movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a watch.#1

585_10#Upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times I have viewed it. The acting is stunningly wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s. The scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western Montana. All in all, this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s. #1
2059_7#What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the Scarecrow is a distinct and original. He really brought me back to the monsters of the 80s. The budget is obviously low and not everybody is Pacino behind the lens but it doesnt matter because it never once takes itself seriously. From the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the Scarecrow, this is truly a b-movie gem. Grab some refreshments, snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax. I enjoyed this film so much I went out a purchased all 3 Scarecrow films. Sure, theyre not for everybody but to each his own. Sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile.#1
7197_7#There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The serial also has good performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb, ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was quick, smart, used well his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any Zorro.#1
7661_10#Scanners II The New Order is just as good as David Cronenbergs classic Scanners, Scanners was made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991 so theirs an eleven year gap between the two movies. The film captures the style of Scanners which is a good thing, it wouldnt be Scanners without a head explosion so Scanners II has a head explosion scene thats just has gruesome as the first. Scanners II The New Order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well. The plot to Scanners II The New Order is a new take on the series since it has the Scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young Scanner named David Kellum discovers hes being used and decides to get revenge. Scanners II The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenbergs sci-fi classic Scanners and should be seen. Check this out. 10/10#1
10945_1#Words cant simply describe how awful this film is. I watched it on video last night, and I simply could not believe what I was seeing. Basically,  Snakeeater  is about an ex-military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by Deliverance-style Rednecks. The films acting, writing, direction, photography, and editing are deplorable along with a song called  Soldier  that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time! However, there is one treat.  Horshack  (Ron Pallio) from  Welcome Back Carter  is in the film playing a laughable bad guy. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at ALL COSTS.#0
5727_1#I just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film I have done on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films I have ever seen. After reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible. But in the mean time avoid this like the plague. I want my 81 mins back with interest. (At least I didnt pay to watch it.)#0
2760_8#Everyone we meet influences our thinking, modifies our ways, a little bit of that person rubs off onto us.  The Eighth Day  takes up this theme (Compare  Rainmaker ). In this film Harry (Daniel Auteuil) a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a Downs Syndrome child on the run. Winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is excellent where Georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasnt enough money. Its the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears. I liked the scene where the Downs Syndrome group on a trip to the Art Gallery escape on a bus and gate-crash the Paradis fun park. The most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where Harry and Georges pass a horse-float on the highway and, looking back, Georges gives the driver a rude salute. But there are some gentle scenes as well, especially the impressive use of close-ups of hands - hands feeling the sun,wind and rain, hands reaching up, hands reaching out and clasping in love and friendship. This is true cinema which touches the heart. There are very moving scenes where Georges proposes to Nathalie, where Georges cradles Harrys head in his arms, where Georges keeps calling for his dear Mom, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh..I felt there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful- the very presence of grass (Did you know it cries when you cut it?), the trees overhead, the song of birds, the little insects - all natures miraculous creatures. They are all there to be enjoyed if we but lie back (like Harry and Georges) look around us and listenA beautiful film.#1
2028_3#On the surface,  Show Me The Money  should have at least finished a full season. You had the always entertaining William Shatner as your host, surrounded by a bakers dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called  The Million Dollar Dancers.  You had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia. And you had big money! So, what went wrong?  The pacing, the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatners terpsichorean talents.#0
7813_1#In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of Hollywood ego, only beaten by the new king kong movie. Superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman Ive ever seen, from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat. He looks just silly wearing the costume. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane, she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, He is actually supermans son, who would have ever thought.) and the acting was horrible. This movie has one good thing going for it, and its name is Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie. What this movie needed was the cast of  lois and clark  (except Kevin Spacey of course) and a different story. I watched this movie after watching  the hills have eyes  and I was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that.#0
1364_4#the more i think about it, there was nothing redeeming about this say 4 out of 10.#0
5497_9#A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself (for further evidence, check out some of the comments on IMDb!). Compares extremely favourably with Oliver Stones  Comandante  (which is mainly an in-depth examination of Fidel Castros nostril hairs). I dont know whether Chavez is everything he presents himself as being, or yet another in the long line of populist Latin-American  caudillos . Nor do I know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of Venezuelans. Its hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but Ive certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of whats at stake, and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the film  were making history , and thats exactly what the film feels like its capturing. Outstanding stuff.#1
6206_8#Im an admirer of Hal Hartleys films, especially 1997s  Henry Fool.   Fay Grim  is a sequel to that film, and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Fay Grim (played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey) tries to track down her missing husbands notebooks, and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage. The supporting cast (most of the folks from the first film as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and a much-welcomed return from 90s indie-darling Elina Lowensohn) is excellent and the film has lots of surprises. The director claims this is part of a  Star Wars -like trilogy, serving as the  Empire Strikes Back  of the series If this is true, I cant wait to see the third installment! I just hope I dont have to wait 10 more years for it.#1
6693_1#Run away from this movie. Even by B-movie standards this movie is dreadful. It is also insidious in its theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie, see it instead. Usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for, in this case there is none. It is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters. The acting is adequate by B-movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting.#0
461_8#Being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities I think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb. To me it was worth watching more than once so Ill give it an 8 on imdb.#1
791_9#Having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on Rialto Channel I found it to be a pleasant, poignant and enriching film.  I say  well done  to the film makers - I have seen 1,000s of worse films #1
6673_7#A lot of the user comments i have seen on the IMDB for this movie dont really do it justice. First of all, let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously. Its supposed to be a fun, yet stupid movie, that doesnt require one to think, only to enjoy it. If you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour, then you will be sorely disappointed. Yet, if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors/actresses, and some good catch-phrases, then you will enjoy it.#1
12033_3#Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. New family moves in, cue the overwritten dialog, mediocre acting, green jello salad with shredded carrots, and every other inside Mormon joke known to man. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie. Anyone inside the Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there. Youll be much better off watching Hesss other movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc..) than trying to sit through this one. The acting is mediocre. Jared Hess has had his hands on much more quality films like  Saints and Soldiers , and  Napoleon Dynamite . I would recommend both movies over this groaner.#0
10009_9#When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves. That being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood S~#1
11113_9#Ive only watched the first series on DVD, but would summarise The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (hence not a  10 ), and far better than any of Guy Ritchies efforts. Although theres plenty of action, some of it pretty bloody, the story is character driven. Even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines; e.g. the priests relationship (or lack of) with Carmilla and the restaurateurs wife, and Christopher and his dimwit friend (who didnt last very long (a Darwin Award nominee?)) 1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce. 2. The music. 3. It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.#1
8254_8#Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, its nearly as light as a feather. The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. Maybe this one isnt for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making. For me anyway,  Fido  is a hoot! My grades 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 01/30/07)#1
41_9# Who Done It?  contains many surefire laughs and gags. It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as  Pardon My Terror. ) It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947. Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film. With his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he didnt tower over everyone else!  Who Done It?  is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.#1
10159_3#More wide-eyed, hysterical 50s hyper-cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti-social, pathological behaviour. Danza and Grayson will leave you begging for mercy. The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency, but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self-explosion. I can listen to the loudest, least friendly death metal band for hours, but give me just a minute of a soprano and I get a splitting headache.#0
8439_3#I can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst Laurel & Hardys. For me, it isnt as close to as bad as  Air Raid Wardens  and  The Bullfighters , but there are some definite huge flaws in it. The film is set up to show Laurel and Hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio. Hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a  London Bridge  dance, surrounded by 20th Century Fox starlets, while in the next room, Laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit. A clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor, leading to a predicable gag where Hardy ends up the looser. Then, in come the racketeers, now selling insurance covering up their protection racket. One of them is a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum. But no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance, they are arrested. As the story wraps up, all of these gags seem to have no point, giving the impression that this was simply a series of one-reelers put together to make a full-length feature, hopefully part of a double bill. L&H, as Ive mentioned in other reviews of their later films, had lost much of their luster after leaving Hal Roachs employ, but surprisingly here, they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year. Had the gags not been as amusing, as was the case with some of their other films, this surely would have ranked a  2  as opposed to a  3 .#0
9154_1#THE. WORST. FILM. EVER. MADE. Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here, I suspect the writer must have a half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says this film is even watchable as anything other than a joke, is a liar or being paid heavily to say so.#0
8438_10#HLOTS was an outstanding series, its what NYPD Blue will never be, on HLOTS the plots are real, the dialog is real, the Relationships are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, Tying up all the loose ends, it was good to have all the gang back together, even a few that passed away show up (wont say how) The storyline was fast paced, emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out. Homicide , Life on the Streets, Network drama at Its BEST  5 STARS  Thumbs UP and all That. Thanks NBC for giving us the Finally we didnt get!#1
10370_9#Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. As I watched this film, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching the O.J. Simpson debacle (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation). Streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best Ive ever seen Sam Neill. The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible.#1
7992_7#Although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable Denzel Washington, one of the best actors around today. MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache-inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness Oliver Stones use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpahs in his classic 60s and 70s films). Still, Scott gets a very good performance from Washington, as well as Fanning, who comes across as far more than a typical movie-brat kid. Harry Gregson-Williams south-of-the-border Spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of Chopin, Debussy, and even Linda Ronstadts classic 1977 country-rock version of  Blue Bayou.  Although the film overall is quite violent, it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years, and overall it is much better than most.#1
8112_9#Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film, with ambition and scope hard to find today. They predict World War II and the way Great Britain was attacked, and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. They change the timing; in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that its amazing. We even see an helicopter (the film is older than them). 9 1/2 out of 10. Inspiring like that final monologue by John Cabal.#1
3018_10#This movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is worser than the original. Its comedy at its best. This movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second. At more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a joke. Göta kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production TV series such as survivor (expediton Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish movie for the Swedish audience. Thus dont see it if you arent familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise Have fun! Johan#1
4842_2#Who did the research for this film? Its set in Baghdad in 2004, however all the Soldiers are wearing ACUs and have all Universal Camouflage Pattern gear. No one was wearing that stuff in 04.  Its like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed them up and swallowed, then vomited out a film. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Im still not sure why I sat through the whole thing. GI Joe was one that really made you think compared to this. STAY AWAY!#0
8573_3#I dont like Sean Penns directing very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The movie has no core, its colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penns work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hells Angels greetings, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensens acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and thats about it. The movie is dead meaningless, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis character. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap.#0
1169_8#Stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven bloodbath. Also cheesy, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event, and the girl comes around to the good guys side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy. Its sad theres no Gloria Grahame but so fantastic that its Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could there be anyone as beautiful as Alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? Yet hes totally tough and icy cool. No one nowadays can touch him--though someone like Jude Law could try I guess. Hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases (and those arent generally my cup of tea)--especially one willy nilly one in the woods. People also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion, for instance in a junkyard cruncher. But beyond the cheese, the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off. More creativity, excitement and freshness in that  forgotten  movie than most of what Ive seen lately.#1
11006_7#This Filmfour funded Sci-Fi movie is most definitely a must see. While it takes huge influence from The Manchurian Candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise; its handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive, despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film. Its good to know that films like this are still being made (even if they arent getting wide releases), and Cypher is refreshing for that reason. The plot twists and turns, which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cyphers mystery. The plot follows Morgan Sullivan; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with Digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons, to him, unknown. However, his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita Cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent; but on the whole, if you want an inventive recent Sci-Fi film; Cypher is the way to go.#1
7860_4#Martin Weisz, who directed the solid  Rohtenburg , will be taking the heat, with Wes Craven, for another shabby  The Hills Have Eyes 2 . The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback, will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake (in name only). A bunch of National Guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one the weekend soldiers are picked off. Thats it. There is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is precious little else to get excited about. The films  heroes  are the usual bunch of clichés and the mutants, a far cry from Cravens original  family , mostly resemble Brian Thompson from  Cobra  coupled with some creatures Stan Winston had left over from the  Wrong Turn  shoot. Much of the action takes place in caves, ala  The Descent , and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A laughable aspect is Wes and Jonathan Cravens addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like Leatherface in Hoopers original  Chainsaw . Weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle, but hes not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.#0
77_7#The film begins with Vincent Price about to begin his performance as a magician. However, mid-way through the very successful show, the police come and shut him down. It seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks Price had created--even those he made on his own time at home. As a result, Price justifiably kills the evil man. The problem is that while the viewer understood why Price killed and most probably thought this was a GOOD thing, because Price was a bit mad, he just couldnt stop at one (sort of like eating Lays Potato Chips). My advice is to see this film AND HOUSE OF WAX (the Price version only). They are both terrific 1950s horror films.#1
14_10#This film has a special place in my heart, as when I caught it the first time, I was teaching adult literacy. It rang very true to me and even an outstanding student I had at the time. There are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion, and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation.  Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro that rank with their best work, a great turn by a young Martha Plimpton, an inspiring story line, and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience.#1
921_2#I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor one more time. She can act, but doesnt get a chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes. Must have come from a stock archive, because the movie is shot direct to videotape. The production values make _Blair Witch_ look professional. Theres a really cheesy animated statue, but no other effects worth noting. This movie is bad, but not amusingly so. The players would do well not to mention it on their resumes.#0
5164_4#The basic plot in this movie isnt bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. But, despite good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is just awful. Instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares off into space and has a  golly I am SOOOO stunned  expression. After just a few minutes it really became annoying for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I dislike for her performance, as she had done more than her share of overacting--in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try a different Crawford film--there certainly were better.#0
1220_9#Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film youll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. However I have no problems with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and its fun watching them play and grow. My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10#1
2996_7#The film starts in the Long Island Kennel Club where is murdered a dog,later is appeared dead as a case of committing suicide a collector millionaire called Arched,but sleuth debonair Philo Vance(William Powell)to be aware of actually killing.There are many suspects  the secretary(Ralph Morgan),the butler,the Chinese cooker,the contender(Paul Cavanagh) in kennel championship for revenge killing dog ,the nephew(Mary Astor) facing off her tyrant uncle,the Italian man(Jack La Rue),the brother,the attractive neighbour..Stylish Vance tries to find out who murdered tycoon,appearing many clues ,as a book titledUnsolved murders. The police Inspector(Eugene Palette)and a coroner are helped by Vance to investigate the mysterious death.The sympathetic forensic medic examines boring the continuous body-count .Whos the killer?.The public enjoys immensely about guess the murder.  The picture is an interesting and deliberate whodunit,its a laborious and intriguing suspense tale.The personages are similar to Agatha Christie stories, all they are various suspects.They are developed on a whole gallery of familiar actors well characterized from the period represented by a glittering casting to choose from their acting range from great to worst. Powell is in his habitual elegant and smart form as Philo.Hes protagonist of two famed detectives cinema,this one, and elegant Nick Charles along with Nora(Mirna Loy)make the greatest marriage detectives. Special mention to Mary Astor as the niece enamored of suspect Sir Thomas,she was a noted actress of noir cinema(Maltese falcon). The movie is magnificently directed by Hollywood classic director Michael Curtiz.He directs utilizing modern techniques as the image of dead through a lock-door,a split image while are speaking for phone and curtain-image.The tale is remade as ¨Calling Philo Vance¨(1940).The film is a good production Warner Bros, by Vitagraph Corp.#1
7696_8#When  Good Times  premiered in 1974, it was one the first black family sitcoms. It centered on the poor Chicago-based Evans family and their struggles to make ends. Most of the early episodes focused on the parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide for the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were terrific actors and had great chemistry as James and Florida Evans. They had three kids J.J., Thelma, and Michael. J.J. was the skirt-chasing but well-meaning teenage son who made up for his lack of subtletly with artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, bright girl who was constantly trading insults with J.J. Michael was a near child prodigy who was well-educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer. First three season A. Last three seasons C+.#1
9014_10#Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter. I hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.#1
3054_1#The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people. (as MST3k Commentary states it Sanata has the dirt on every! Santas Tentacles reach far and wide! There is no hiding from the Klaus Organization ) I give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.#0
5538_7#A couple(Janet and Richard) go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house. Soon, a pair of escaped convicts show up and, after much delaying of the inevitable, they proceed to rape Janet and lock Richard in a birdcage. In short, this was a good film. Not the greatest horror film Ive ever seen, but it is certainly a lot of fun. Its not exactly the easiest film to find. Its possible to find it in the USED section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough. Its not for everyone, but if youre a fan of trash cinema then its definitely worth checking out.#1
10236_1#Absolutely fantastic.  P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film freeso I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money backit really was THAT bad.#0
4547_1#The movie was TERRIBLE  Easily the worst movie I have seen in the past few years. One of those movies I will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question  What is the worst movie you have seen?  Answer Celestine Prophecy. Trust meI read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then, they treated the audience like we are r tarded. There is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence. It is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and cant simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow. They didnt spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is pretty boring too but I enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart. DONT SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.#0
5754_2#I watched mask in the 80s and its currently showing on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears. I never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. Its just plain awful! It is no where near in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made. I only watch it on Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes on straight after it (thats if mask doesnt put me to sleep first). One of the lesser 80s cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on Fox Kids!#0
862_1#Succubus, the edited version of Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden, is a struggle to sit through, even at a lean 76 minutes; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma. I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy Euro Horror again  life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this.#0
3915_9#Ive seen this film at least 4 times since 84 and its still great every time I see it. Its a very compelling version of the opera Carmen, with amazing Flamenco dancing, bare bones sets, and, of course, wonderful music. Its independent movie making at its best and probably my all time favorite foreign film.#1
827_4#Blazing saddles! Its a fight between two estranged brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences, with dippy love-interest Debra Winger caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the TV whiz-kid behind  Moonlighting ) smothers the darkly-textured comedy in Vince Gilligans screenplay with a presentation so slick, the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant. It has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature, but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities. These arent even characters, theyre plot functions. Barely-released to theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good. Winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed.  1/2 from     #0
3000_8#Michael Curtiz directed this 1930 very-stylish whodunit from a script by Robert Presnell Sr., Robert N. Lee and Peter Mine. The original novel they adapted was  The Kennel Murder Case , perhaps from a writers standpoint the best of the Philo Vance mysteries by the strange S.S. Van Dine. Vance was a long-worded and superior detective genius, and his character being assigned to William Powell probably meant the executives at Warner Brothers were aware of the possibility that in less-engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers. Fortunately they assigned suave William Powell first to the character.; later he was played by Basil Rathbone, Warren William, and Paul Lukas before being consigned to  B  picture status.The other question as always with Warner Brothers executives is why they chose Vance as a character; their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law, with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers. This film has a despicable villain who gets murdered, and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex. The characters are unarguably unusually well-realized, the direction rather good and unusually swift-paced; and except for a darkish B/W look, the film avoids the comedic asides, superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries. Jack Okey did the good art direction. The music by Berhard Kaun is serviceable; Orry-Kelly did the costumes. William Reese provided the mostly-indoor cinematography. In the interesting cast, Powell is THE Philo Vance of his time, mostly sober-minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there. Eugene Palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to Vance, with his very professional timing. The other actor who comes off best is handsome Paul Cavangh, very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part. Mary Astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved. Also in the cast were Helen Vinson as the villains woman, Jack La Rue, Ralph Morgan (best known as Frank Morgans brother), Robert Barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill, Archer Coe, and Frank Conroy as his likable brother with Robert McWade as the D.A.; quirky and funny Etiienne Girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene. James lee as the abused Chinese servant is excellent and intelligent. The story breaks into four parts. First there is shad doings at a dog show, where Vance, Coe and Cavanagh are all showing West Highland terriers. Cavanaghs dog is killed, by Coe, to prevent him winning the title over his own entry. The second portion of the scene involves a leave-taking; someone is confused enough by who has gone where, after Coe parts from his girl friend, Vinson, to murder his nice brother by mistake. Enter Vance, to find out who did in Archer Coe in a locked room and how, with the help of Palette; the romantic difficulties are straightened out, the Chinese servant is exonerated, we find out who broke the expensive vase, who will marry whom, how Archer Coe was done in and why the butler did not do it--but someone else with a good excuse did. This is a more-than-good little mystery, which skilled Hungarian-born director Curtiz took quite seriously. He used wipes, swift cuts, changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera-work to achieve variety, interest and a sustained pace. Many writers, critics and experts, myself included, consider this to be the best of the Vance projects, although others are estimable as well.#1
4455_3#Where to start? OK, dont compare this film to fight club for a start - ridiculous. If it was even a patch on fight club, the violence, blood, gore etc would be much more evident and realistic. Secondly, this film is no football factory - which is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). Fair enough, the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending i might add. But the film on the whole is poor, seriously poor. As people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film - i disagree - either a simple casting error, or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious from scene one some American/Geordie was playing the role. Dont get me wrong, good looking guy, who looks great with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the fake steward situation. Also, when the GSE are going to play United up north, they go on the train expecting only 3 of them - doesnt make any sense - this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs, which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - did West Ham and Milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the Championship together? Hmm, ten years OK. And Im sure Bother would be able to just waltz into a Milwall firm pub. Basically, a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football, and hooliganism. If you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism,, you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence. Ross George#0
10764_9#Its a good movie maybe I like it because it was filmed here in PR. The actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome! The guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls.#1
6526_2#Hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly. You might think things would perk up when they explore Mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red/orange filter which makes everything very murky. The Martian landscape/vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing. There are echoes of Bride Of The Monster when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about, the difference being that the Ed Wood film is a hundred times more entertaining. Better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the sci-fi music score, repeated endlessly, will drive you insane. If you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time.#0
7888_1#didnt know anything about the film or that it was based on a best selling book.Tried guessing from the opening scenes what it would be about,best guess,buried treasure and a death list.That lasted about 15 minutes when i got the sneaky suspicion that the film was crap.Ill not bore you with how bad the plot and acting were but anyone who gave it more than two stars must work for the film makers.I watched until the hero jumped into his corvette to rush to the hospital.He had his on his suit,shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and a t/shirt.Couldnt even get the continuity right. I got the Christian theme,hard to miss it .#0
1999_9#Oliver! the musical is a favorite of mine. The music, the characters, the story. It all just seems perfect. In this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical, director Carol Reed brings the Broadway hit to life on the movie screen. Whether or not you like musicals or not, one listen to these tunes and you will be humming them all day long. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art.#1
5437_10#Pandro S. Berman was  In Charge of Production  but that made him the so-called Line Producer. But who produced this epic, filmed not in Arizona but in Californias Mohave Desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the  gold temple , the Thuggee huts, the British outpost at Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. The minor technical faults can and must be forgiven. Whats unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for best music, although maybe the Academy didnt offer such at the time. A single theme was played in various tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood-setting. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the widow Kiplings demands. An actor playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In the initial release his scenes were cut, per Mrs. Kiplings demands. Later they were included and lent a  connection  of Kiplings immortal poem to Ben Hechts screenplay. Interestingly, this very typically and pro-British story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the British.#1
10265_2#Kirstie Alley, looking a bit slimmer, but only a bit, is in this mess along with a man who is a MacGuyver lookalike, bleached blond hair and all. The premise of the movie is about an older woman (50 ) who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer. Not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting, inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for Kirsties character and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who portrays Kirsties brother is so wooden and miscast, it was torture to watch their scenes. What is there to say about this film. Avoid it.#0
6522_1#This is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the RUSCICO DVD release for North America. I dont know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. Anyway, the sound mixing on these DVDs was absolutely horrible. The levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that I didnt know which would blow out first -- my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these DVDs was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. And, like another user has already commented, when we selected English audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track the dubbing was in Russian, so youre SOL if you understand neither. Ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. Before you fork out $50+ for this movie on DVD for your own library, Id heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if youve never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.#0
11390_10#The story and music (George Gershwin!) are wonderful, as are Levant, Guetary, Foch, and, of course, Kelly. One things missing, and that thing is a good leading lady. Im sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. Anyway, despite her, the plot moves along nicely with the famous (and deservedly so) Ballet. Oh the colours, the dazzling reds, blues, greens, and yellows. Musnt forget the beiges as well. ; ) I just adore the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and the ever-so-brilliant Ballet. So I suppose what Im trying to say is this Please, by all means see it, and enjoy it, because though it isnt the best, it is MARVELOUS. But be sure not to forget that other Gene Kelly musical with the 20 year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward.#1
265_1#The plot of this terrible film is so convoluted Ive put the spoiler warning up because Im unsure if Im giving anything away. The audience first sees some man in Jack the Ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago. Then were up to modern day and a young Australian couple is looking for a house. Were given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror. Some 105 year old woman lived there. There are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den. An old fashioned straight-razor falls out when theyre renovating and the husband keeps it. I guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams. Oh yeah, the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks.  This movie was such a frustrating experience I wanted to call my PBS station and ask for my money back! The ONLY enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time, but even that couldnt redeem this muddled, incoherent mess.#0
358_4#Paul Armstrong is a liberal, Scottish-born, professor of law at Harvard, known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty, who is hired to take on the case of Bobby Earl, a young black man from Florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of Joanie Shriver, an eleven year old white girl. Earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is Blair Sullivan, a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders. Armstrong visits Sullivan in his cell on death row, hoping to persuade him to confess to Joanies murder, thereby saving Earl from the electric chair.  There is another problem with  Just Cause . The first half of the film looks like a standard liberal  issue  movie, anti-death penalty, anti-racist and critical of heavy-handed policing. The second half looks more like the work of a die-hard reactionary, preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards, that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair, that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes. The filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the (presumably unwanted) effect of reversing its political stance, or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it. A suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency. 4/10#0
3298_10#This is definitely one of the best movies Ive ever seen-- it has everything-- a genuinely touching screenplay, fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch, an actually elegant romance (its a shame that that kind of romance just doesnt seem to exist anymore), lovely songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them. The ending was only a disappointment in that I was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end-- but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there. Definitely check this movie out-- over and over again. There are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look.#1
9169_1#It gets really bad. The only half-way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. The acting is horrible, save Kirk. The story is as holey as the grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie, if it wasnt already a corpse. So all in all its a waste of your life. I would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale.#0
1153_10#This has to be, hands down, hats off, one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. Starting with the animated blowing, popping bubbles, the entrance to the Daytime Awards, the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet, the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech, the venomous comments uttered by the actors jealous co-stars and producer, under phony smiles. Now THAT is only in the first few minutes. Then, all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. Ridiculous in a good way, no, make that a great way. This was the first time Id seen the always charming Teri Hatcher. While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives, she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark. Not a huge follower, but if I run across an episode Id watch it. Robert Downey, jr., does a great turn as slimy, smarmy, snaky, sycophantic David Seaton Barnes, the producer whod give his right eye to see Sally Fields Celeste Talbert leave the show, if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriartys Montana Moorehead. Ill stop there - I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy, or at least a novela. If youve seen it, then reminisce. If you havent, youve missed a real classic, but not really. The DVDs are made of a material thatll last for at least 25 years, and this movie is timeless, so what the hell.#1
8383_7#Robot Jox tries hard, but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together -- robot against robot, man against man, man against woman. The premise had potential, but it seems the script wasnt really given the couple of more drafts it needed. Still, it was fairly good, for a science fiction action movie. Part of it was because the script was by Joe Haldeman. For those who arent familiar with the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel  The Forever War.  Its considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels, right up there with Robert Heinleins  Starship Troopers  and John Steakleys  Armor.  And this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie, rather than giant robots. Its closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was Paul Verhoevens  Starship Troopers,  which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on. Dont bring high expectations into this and you probably wont be disappointed. Its better than a lot of other low-budget flicks and even some big-budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts.#1
8289_4#Im sorry, but this is such a bad movie its hilarious. Football hooligans arguing in a travel lodge? Suits? Shades?! Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this, it is as far from the truth as you can get. 4/10. Its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism i have ever seen.#0
6924_7#This complicated western was a milestone in the career of JAMES STEWART after his return from war service, wanting to change his image by doing a western, which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the 50s since its very impressive. Too bad it wasnt photographed in Technicolor. Well worth viewing and definitely an above average story.#1
4220_7#This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe. Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation, while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York. He manages, however, to leave behind some clues, scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo enters the case, suspects her at once, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordons secretary and would-be blackmailer. Hartley is, I believe, the grand daughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner. Im not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button, which is on display during a belly dance sequence, but Ive always admired Skinner anyway. All in all, a nice job by everyone concerned.#1
4184_8#Some war movies succeed where others do not, and that can be judged from a variety of angles. The humanistic angle, one where you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack, the camaraderie amongst soldiers, the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat, etc..) are always movies I find compelling. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film. This film succeeds on that level as well. It speaks of  The Highest Honor  and that honor is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with Western thought, but it is, to the very end, a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story.#1
10825_1#What made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to Charlotte Brontes brilliance of the original classic story. I was deeply disappointed to find that this movie, which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste, had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor. Also missing was Jane Eyres charismatic sense of self, which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over, including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame at having to beg for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all to get away from a man she loved were, in my opinion, poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie. The title character seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book, I cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting. The screenplay and Direction did little if any credit to the classic story.#0
4256_8#Such a delightful movie! Very heart warming. One cant help falling in love with the character of Gigi. Hes adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist. The whole movie revolves around him. He lives in a wonderful world  living all life  curiosity, desire and anticipation. There is an elder brother who tries to steal his glory but really remains in the shadow all his life. The father is very stereotypically Italian and so is the mother. I wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene  and have them cry and laugh. I also wish that there was at least something redeeming about the elder brother. His personality seems to have been trashed entirely. Passion and ardour  thats the key to life. And looking through the camera  focusing on small details and savoring the delicate details of life.#1
322_1#I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. I was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so I have only myself to blame. But like most, I didnt believe all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just Sandler haters. I couldnt have been more wrong. You might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity. Dont. Please dont. Trust me, Im doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those that think Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those that have not yet seen it.#0
7400_9#This is a great story of family loyalty which, thankfully, doesnt resort to the usual tricks (or at least the ones Im used to seeing in American and European films) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension. Its very watchable and very lovable. It has some beautiful cinematography, but doesnt rely on that alone to entertain.#1
3261_4#After Watergate, Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras, what the world needed was a good old-fashioned chapter-play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the America of 1936 or the jungles of South America in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures. Unfortunately what it got in 1975 was Doc Savage, The Man of Bronze. Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pals final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robesons pulp-paperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other  We can do better than that,  and adding a bullwhip, a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix. Its a film Id really like to like more, but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities. No wonder Doc Savage, The Arch Enemy of Evil, the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits, never happened.#0
352_4#Seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie. And so I sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief. Beside Ed Harris no-one seems to own the skills of acting. Even Sean Connery, who I normally worship, must have had an off-day during the entire filming of Just Case. Not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me. Conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do.#0
8858_2#Ben a out-of-town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice, but hes approached by Stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, his sisters best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to put a end to this evil. 1/5#0
4561_3#The trailers get you to the movie, but the movie just wasnt worth my 8.50.. it has some good effects, but the storyline.. yech, i like tommy lee jones and will smith as actors, they have both done some good films, but i wish they hadnt added this one to their resumes. To be honest, the book is better..#0
3376_9#This movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast, a gripping story with a chilling ending, great music, and excellent visuals without significant special effects. It is interesting to note though that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future dont appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted. Thats not to say were out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition. It shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics  1984 ,  2001 A Space Odyssey (compare its space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Asimovs  I Robot  (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990s).#1
10608_2#I dont think any movie of Van Dammes will ever beat Universal Soldier but u never know. This movie was good but not as good as 1st. VD returns a Luc & must do battle again. He tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle. VD has a kid this time from Ally W., good it showed a pic of them 2. Goldberg was cool, he does his famous move-forgot what its called cause i dont watch wrestling-sucks. VD & Goldberg had some good fights. It was the ending like the 1st but just not that good. VD does his best move in his career, like always-the HELICOPTER KICK. Even though, the final ending shouldve been longer. Anyway, it is worth seeing but it will never top the original.#0
6771_7#so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered. i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly i like the  less violent  part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now. I thought it interesting that Belisarios Airwolf and JAG have similar theme - the lead actor (Hawke and Harm) both are looking for an MIA relative (brother, father). wonder if Robert Belisarios personal life mimics these 2 shows theme. Question - does anyone have pictures of Hawkes cabin. I love that cabin (kinda like a dream cabin of mine) and that is one of the scenes i remember about Airwolf.#1
3334_4#This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing than scary, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like. And, come to think of it, the plot is rather disgusting actuallybut handled with some kind of taste. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. Also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The  monster , after it is exposed, isnt very scary either unfortunately. The somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it, making it appear as a TV-movie more than something made for theaters. But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic#0
4734_2#You like beautiful girls? Yeah me too. What is there bad to say about beautiful girls/women? Nothing imo, so why would I give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, although it got the  talents  of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto?  So forget about the story, about character development, about real emotions, about the  acting  (and no, I dont think women in skirts walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting!)  what does that leave? Yes the action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and thats the reason I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I was giving this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time  You have better things to do/watch, believe me #0
3275_10#I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night. Now I bought it on DVD because I can remember that I liked it. Overall a good movie. I give it a 8 out of 10.#1
3936_7#This is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of Lincoln(born 1809 Hodgensville-Kentucky- and died in Washington 1865). Fords excellent movie takes Abraham Lincoln(Fonda) from his youth. He studied laws, common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837.This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his log-cabin days, initial relationship to Mary Todd(Weaver), following the couple from their first ball,and his departure for congress candidate. But focuses mainly on a brothers(Richard Cromwell,Eddie Quillan) accused for murder, the posterior trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum(Alice Brady). The Lincoln-Fonda as defender advocate and Donald Meek-prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant. Another biographies about Abraham Lincoln are the following 1) ¨Abraham Lincoln¨(1930) by D.W.Griffith with Walter Huston, Una Merkel, talking from his birth until his assassination; 2) ¨Abe Lincoln in Illinois¨(1940)by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey, Ruth Gordon, concerning similar events to Fords film through his career as lawyer 3)TV version titled ¨Gore Vidals Lincoln¨ with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd.#1
9762_3#Alan Alda plays real-life  Sports Illustrated  writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather wan, uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy. Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material, shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion (with macho commentary) and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy; still, by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up, he turns the main narrative into a jumble. Aldas smug, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes (and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Aldas girlfriend--hows that for a fantasy?).  1/2 from     #0
5241_7#Excellent film from Thaddeus OSullivan featuring strong performances from a host of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny subject matter, and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of 1970s Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict. On one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles. On the other it deals with a Loyalist gang who are intent on propagating violence. Very interesting and, thankfully, entertaining. Dont be expecting any laughs, though. 7 out of 10.#1
171_8#I disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as  just  entertainment. Set right after the carefree, roaring 20s, during the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale, with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times. Yet this fast-paced and tightly-plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale. Score EIGHT out of TEN#1
11669_9#Being the prototype of the classical Errol Flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in Maureen OHara (what an exquisite beauty!) and Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure. Hollywood at its best!#1
9107_7#Several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters. The shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives. All are transformed at the end of the movie. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; Her daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) is retarded and has a restricted life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife. Isabel (Ángela Molina) is a bored rich lady. This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is more technically competent, but somewhat mechanical. This has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually. After seeing this, you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie-city Madrid.#1
11155_2#The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library (and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it), and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it didnt take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend. Terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays Ive had the displeasure of seeing brought to life (such as it was, horribly crippled and mutilated) in a long, long time. Best laughs actually come from the  Making of  featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that wont be utterly forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi  The Birds  Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane  Friday the 13th  Hodder! How this came to pass, Ill never know, and to be honest, I dont really care. Watch at your own risk, and dont say you havent been warned. This is film-making at its pretentious, craven worst. It only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women, and even then, just barely.#0
503_2#After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I found NO Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie. Give this one a miss.#0
8325_1#I just saw this movie last night and, being someone who had very low expectations to begin with, was still disappointed. The most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point (the guy being awake during the surgery), had NOTHING to do with the outcome. It would have ended the same way regardless. So, what was the point of this? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just laughable from start to finish. Im fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel, you would be in more pain than that.#0
7757_1#I have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too, if youre gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the f/x to back it up. Also dont get a bunch of z list actors to play in it. Another thing, just about all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so dont blatantly copy it. All in all this movie sucked, f/x sucked, acting sucked, story unoriginal. Lets talk about the acting for just a second, the Carradine guy whos career peaked in 1984 when he did  Revenge of the Nerds  (which was actually a great comedy). Hes not exactly z list, he can act. He just should have said no to this s--t bag. He should have did what Mark Hamill did after  Return of the Jedi  and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as a  Nerd  and that should have been that. I understand he has bills to pay, but that hardly excuses this s--t bag. Have I called this movie that yet? O.K. I just wanted to be sure. If I sound a little hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2hrs of my life I could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel, and I feel cheated. Ill close on that note. Thank you for your time.#0
3744_4#This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamonds theory of  Guns, Germs and Steel , explaining how Europeans have dominated much of the globe.

7787_10#This movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown America for a young girl on her own. The realism and subtle nuances, offered to Ashley Judds character, Ruby, by the storyline, capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of Florida. From the slam of a screen door, to the lack of work, the echoes of what life is really like on the  red-neck riviera  provide rough choices for the young girl. Paradise did not come easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit, and learns to be her own woman, with a strength that flows from within. Ashley Judds winning smile, and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration. The careful pace of the character development resembles that of  Ulees Gold  in 1997, starring Peter Fonda, and also directed by Victor Nunez.#1
7849_9#This short is a puzzlement. Words fail me here, as this is almost indescribable, Technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing), this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or  normal-because it most certainly is not either. This be an odd one, gang. Well worth checking out, but if things like Ren and Stimpy make your head hurt, you may want to skip this. Recommended.#1
8009_9#Ah, true memories. I lived in Holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every Sunday evening and later Tuesdays. I saw it during my 14-16s. Very good for my (at the time school-)English, as Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages, except for kiddies shows nowadays. So you would hear the original voices and language. - The best series were the first three ones and then after the third series, the great character, Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (I dont think they ever really caught him, he always escaped, leaving room to have him appear again in a next story) because evidently the series also was distributed to Germany, and a Nazi enemy wouldnt go over very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent Nazi aristocrat, who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on England. It was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal. They were very believable to me at the time and as a kid I could just imagine to be part of these youngsters, who at the time were about four years older than me. It was a very exciting series to me, standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with  the Prisoner  as well. I hope they will publish a good quality DVD of the series, that would be wonderful. Even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch. The later series were not as good, watered down and just not as much fun as the first three. Hopefully they also find the other series with Von Gelb to be put on DVD. Greetings from Canada.#1
10237_10#This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kongs New Wave that began with Tsui Harks  ZU Warriors of Magic Mountain . Tsui set a tone for the New Waves approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy.  Burning Paradise  put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance. Of course, fortunately, the film doesnt end there. Though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (If you want to know how, see the film!) Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. Hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all.#1
5452_4#As far as films go, this is likable enough. Entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting enough story. I would have really quite liked it had I not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in. Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet every character is English (save for Seans girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs & roles. As a Scottish woman (& as a viewer who likes her  real life  films to be a bit more like real life) I really dont think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented Scottish actorsor at least got English ones who could toss together a decent accent! The futile attempt at using the word  wee  a few times did nothing but to further the insult.#0

5159_2#Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. It initially looks great but ultimately provides NO satisfaction--none. The film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on. I really am unsure why it was made in the first place--it certainly wasnt made to provide any sort of entertainment.#0
3183_9#Before seeing this, I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated  Emmanuelle  series starring Sylvia Kristel. It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be. It actually has a story, and it is very romantic indeed. What makes Yellow Emanuelle so good is its leading heroine, the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee. She plays her character, Emy Wong so sweetly, that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her. Emy Wong is a much-respected doctor, statuesque, with a regal quality. She comes from an important old family, where ancient customs are still practiced. Emy will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met. The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage. It is simply how it is done in her world. However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works. Emy decides to do away with custom, and she gives herself to her Western man. But only after a very long courtship, as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman. Her pilot, George, is a good guy, and promises to marry Emy, so that she doesnt lose her respectability and place in her rigid society. Neither one counts on a third party, one Ilona Staller, who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man, that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her. Her place in society is gone, she has been debased. The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud, elegant woman gives up her career, as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father, and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution. I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale. I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town, and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute! Classic drama. I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama. One would expect lots of sex and nudity here, but there is not much. And when there is, it is totally non-exploitative, and very artsy and soft-core. If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle, with Sylvia Kristel, than you most likely will appreciate this, lesser known classic. I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details. The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice. Her father shows George, and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees. He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees. Totally unexpected. After catching it on late night cable TV years ago, I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film. When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer. More sex? No, more melodrama. For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease! I actually preferred the cable version better. I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD. I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70s soundtrack. While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare, and quite special. I recommend it to thoughtful viewers who dont need sex and violence to maintain their interest.#1

9662_4#I usually read reviews before I watch a movie. Guess what, I didnt do that before watching TLB, and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating at IMDb. I found it to have a total lack of story. You just get dropped into it (and, sadly, not in the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie), and it also has a sudden end, which was very unsatisfying for me. I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone, except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it.#0
11535_7#Bill Crains rarer than rare slasher movie certainly doesnt follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts. The bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons; - a sin thats virtually unacceptable in most post-Halloween genre pieces. But theres still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that youve grown to expect. Just as Wally Kozs surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family, Mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director. Looking through the credits I noticed numerous Crains listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature. But despite fairly good distribution across the globe, the movie failed to make an impression either side of the Atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the VHS market. Nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so I strained my resources to track a copy down  Mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite. When you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck, you have to say that they did a damn good job. The flaws are numerous, but never detract credibility from the net result. Unfortunately youve probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy. If you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store, then make sure you pick it up. Recommended.#1
1569_2#Weak plot, unlikely car malfunction, and helpless fumbling characters. At first I thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 I was astonished. This is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies I have ever seen. If you read this, be advised, if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting, like watching paint dry.#0
9596_10#This movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer. Few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence, and I can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it. There is no other movie in which I have both laughed so much and cried so much. Yes, it is about DMD and accessible travel; on those issues alone, it is a worthwhile venture, but it is more. It is about friendship. It is about life itself, about living every day that youre alive. And its a great, fun, adventurous narrative. This is why God created the cinema! See this movie #1
9888_10#Although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is in fact nothing of the sort. It is a political and cultural allegory of Mexicos post-Columbian odyssey, as even a passing glance at Mexicos history will attest.   Erendira  is gorgeous. A big-screen experience would be ideal, if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening. But if not, VHS is better than never seeing it at all.#1
11890_1#From the first time I saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography I thought this guy, this friend of the Scwarz must be like 6 foot or 6ft 2in.  But all in all, not as good as Barettas Island, I gave it a 1 and an overall rating of awful for awful-good B movie. Im waiting for the sequel, maybe like Barettas revenge on Montazuma (Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then, declares war on the water co.) or Barettas powder war where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically gene-splice and create a hybrid super bug (insect) that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug, it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar. Then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature. Right?( )#0
1482_10#The best film about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids. The real intrusion or help of friends -or executioner if we leave-. The real role of families they can help or they can destroy us. The mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality. A couple who thinks in a special marriage, live a painful story in their future own history. Maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the deep of their hearts, they like a beautiful marriage and family, if not, Why they like marriage? A truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple of each one of their decisions, of each one actions in their lives. The family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her, only by existing. The screenplay is wonderful. The performances are great Steffania and Tomasso, ¡the almost cynical priest! An excellent direction and script. The colors and the management of the cameras, superb.#1

1788_7#After seeing the trailer for Evening, you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved, (I mean they even got Rocky Horrors own Brad, Barry Bostwick, to show the world he is still acting), and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie. While not entirely true, the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer, and that isnt necessarily a bad thing. This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. Her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and Harris killed Buddy soon plays out. No matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good or bad. It is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life. What may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to ever happen. While not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after, Evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table. You may be able to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together, but you cant argue that the acting isnt worth sticking around for. Maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see, however, when it is all put together, there may also be something coming out of it that couldnt have been achieved without all the other story threads. Either way, the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it.#1
9059_7#This is a good movie, a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do. If you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book, you will be very very disappointed. I was somewhat disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school. Overall, this was a good family movie with some weak points. I rate this movie 7/10.#1
11641_7#I just caught an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started. I have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart-breaking than his drug addiction. Heres this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arriving he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who ever lived, and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general. Understandably, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass? At any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over peoples lives. Sometimes its hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addicts indifference, although I have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean-cut. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the end, and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life. But still, its a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that#1
6393_8#This is a must see for independant movie fans, but it also holds up well against mainstream movies. I think we have the makings of the next Woody Allen or #1
186_8#There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles. William Haines could act, and you can see why he was one of the screens most popular leading men. (Until a potential scandal forced him from the business). Please, even if youre not a fan of the silents, take the time to catch this film when you can. Its really a terrific trip back in time.#1
5601_4#I only watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. I was certainly disappointed. Pick one of the others mentioned and youll be better off.#0
10006_7#In this  critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). When troubling questions arise about this boys (story), however, Gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret  according to films official synopsis.         The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin#1
10464_1#This movie is not based on the bible. It completely leaves Christ out of the movie. They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ. Let alone talk about it. It does not quote from scriptures. The end times are called the great tribulation. The movie does not even show bad times. The seven bowls, seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing its structure. The anti-Christ was killed 3 1/2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended. The only part they got correct was there was two prophets. The did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures. The worst part of it was I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take unsaved people to it. I feel that the movie is evil. It is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does. I just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books. The second problem with the movie is it was just bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. I have seen better episodes of Miami vice.#0
1411_4#This movie was great the first time I saw it, when it was called  Lost in Translation.  But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a cranky Latino woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in Translation, we get meaningless blabbering in 10 Items that verges on annoying. Instead of characters that were pensive and introspective as in Translation, we get characters that spew pointless advice on topics they have no clue about. How can a character that wears hundred dollar T-shirts and has never been inside a Target department store expect to give advice to a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Dont think that stops him. If he isnt giving her clothing advice, hes telling her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment, and yet the characters keep finding time to run another errand, be it washing the car, stopping at Arbys, or just laying around to list off their 10 Items or Less lists of things they love and hate. I kept wanting to yell at them saying,  Didnt you say you had somewhere to be? What the heck are doing? A minute ago you were practically late, now youre eating roast beef and pondering your lives!  Until I saw this movie, I never truly understood how something could  insist upon itself,  but I think this movie does exactly that, and undeservedly so. The dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympatheticwith the exception that I felt sorry for both of the actors for having signed onto this project.#0
8361_8#I had mixed feelings for  Les Valseuses  (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up liking it. I would not call it vulgar ( Dumb and Dumber  is vulgar,  The Sweetest Thing  is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially, the females would not like or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way two antiheroes treat every woman theyd meet seems unspeakable. But the more I think of it the more I realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem. I am fascinated how Blier was able to get away with it. The movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable it is well written, the acting by all is first - class, and the music is sweet and melancholic. Actually, when I think of it, two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to they prepared a woman in the train (the lovely, docile blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debuts in René Cléments  Forbidden Games (1952) at age 6) for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who was finally able to get a frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) exited and satisfied; they enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early screen appearances.) Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level. In short, I am not sure Id like to meet Gérard Depardieus Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaeres Pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but I had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring.#1
10943_10#I have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review, takes pity on me, whisks me to Hollywood and involves me in her freaky/funny world. But in all seriousness, it was good. First episode is obviously finding its feet, but its got that Silverman weirdness running all the way through it. Its not a laugh out loud sort of comedy, but thats good thing, too much has a laughter-track to it, and this wouldnt be right with cues when to laugh, its to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all. I can easily see this as being the bizarro Drew Carey show with its weird characters and incredibly strong central character. Well worth a watch, look forward to the following episodes. A VERY good chance from the usual comedy out there.  ps, Sarah? Call me.#1
7383_9#Extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbania. For the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film, it has the grit of Mexican feature  Amores Perros  with a character not too far off Max Cady, from both Cape Fears, although this is not, by any means, a film about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay hitman Anisio (Miklos) to off their third partner (and majority share holder) in said construction outfit. The murder is blamed on the city, but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare Anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime, not only trespassing but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in. The look is almost entirely handheld, grainy, the performances outstanding throughout, especially so as first time actor (and member of classic Brazilian pop band Titãs), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror. I saw the film at the Brasília film Fest in November 2001. It has since done very well in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho#1
6048_1#Even duller, if possible, than the original (I hope I may say that under the IMDb guidelines). THE FRENCH CONNECTION at least tried to absorb European influences, to complicate the conventional view of the American police detective, even if the attempt was foundered by Friedkins ambivalence, Americaness and general indirection. The (relative) arthouse boom of the 1960s (especially with the nouvelle vague) allowed for a huge influence of European cinema in Hollywood. This lent a new vigour and complexity to a weary medium, and, in the best of them (eg BONNIE AND CLYDE, early Scorcese), a new subversion of received practice. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its difficultly distanced style, and anti-detective figure. TWO is old Hollywoods right-wing reassertion of American values. #0
10242_8#I saw this when it first came to video, my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time What stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just dont say the one thing that youre shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say. This is what I like the most about the movie I guess, that the main characters dont do mean things to each other halfway through they dont break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on. Considering the target audience, who Im sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues I think Ill give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story. Its a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think.#1
6237_4#The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He sounds so concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie. This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of saving planet earth, that is.#0
10294_8#Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement on Carreys past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies. With a slightly toned down Carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self, Carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic, tearfully somber moments. Elements of Jims real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie. This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script. While still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy/drama, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste. Eight out of ten stars.#1
9553_9#I agree with the other comments. I saw this movie years ago. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as a dandy. The ribaldry is unsurpassed. If this comes out on video, I will definitely buy it.#1
9004_1#Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman. #0
1674_2#The premise was intriguing, but sadly this film just doesnt do any justice to it. The casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect. I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial), characters were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage (and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development), and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story. A very forgettable film.#0
4016_10#This wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun GREAT music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors do marvelous jobs--with truly standout performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leones  Once Upon a Time in the West ). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film I have EVER seen #1
7512_8#Firstly, I have heard great things about this film, not least among the retro/vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love Bettie Page and it did not disappoint. Shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes, the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of Bettie Page. Page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirties for Jesus Christ. Her belief in God and Jesus never goes away, even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been given a gift by God to do this thing. Seeing this film, I am more knowledgeable about Page and in awe at her modesty, beliefs and demeanour. She is one of a kind, compared with the identi-kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can actually say There is life after porn.#1
6905_7#I thought that Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and the dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played his role equally as perfect. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will. But he became more confident and comfortable with the role as time passed. Since everything happens for a reason in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did. Im guessing that he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in Parador. I think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did. But.. anyways.. this is why I gave this film a 7 out of 10.#1

5463_1#I saw Arthur(the TV series and the books)years ago and never was fond of the show very much(if youre a fan of this cartoon,sorry if Im spoiling it for you,but this is actually what I think).Lots of people liked it,but I didnt. The greatest cartoon was Rockos Modern Life,not Arthur(no offense).#0
8991_10#DIG! is funny, fun, amusing, interesting, stylish, and very well done. Knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told, especially with such style and substance. If you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see. Focusing on The Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol, and insanity. If I did not know that this is footage of real people, I would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece. The story is compelling, concise, and simply amazing.#1
11098_1#Like most people I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film, especially the  film makers were then attacked  aspect that the case seems to emphasize, what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob. Avoid like the plague.#0
322_10#this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn. i cant fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but arent we all?#1
6654_7#The movie took a new angle to Gandhis life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.#1
6621_8#I just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent sci-fi film noire. Its style is definitively unique and very well made. It is filmed with actual actors, but transformed into a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before. It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does it well. Its a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures. The story and mood remind of Blade Runner, and if you liked that one you will surely like this one, too. The storyline is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists. This film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely dont like sci-fi or b&w.#1
4578_1#Another cult strikes again. This isnt a spoiler, because the REAL ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly-long, pseudo-scientific infomercialRamthas School of Enlightenment. When any religion/philosophy needs to hide behind an OZ-like screen of deceit, I walk away. Thank Ramtha I watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a  friend to have wasted precious resources on this New-Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they  truly believe they can walk on water  enough to take that guidance to its  logical  conclusionin other words; walk, drownor shut up -) As a movieit deserves a strong  1  on its entertainment value, especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history (the photographers roommateeeeeeek!). If you must see this film, borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it.#0

452_10# My child, my sister, dream  Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming,  Enchanted April  is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of highest quality.#1
10300_10#A very funny movie. It was good to see Jim Carrey back in top form. It was definitely worth the price of admission. Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film. I think they may have played the dog a bit too much however, still a good film to see.#1
9336_9#German private TV is ill-renowned for copying Dutch and  naturally  US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics Screwball. In short Watch it. I dont have the foggiest what the English synchronisation is like, but hey, its worth learning German just to watch them four seasons. Pseudo-happy end included.#1
1010_10#I love this show! This show is amazing, and i hope it never dies. Atlantis here we come!#1
326_10# Jag är nyfiken  Yellow  is a lot of fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I was, on numerous occasions, laughing out loud. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-aware, explorative. Dont expect Bergman here. This movie is about a youth in the early- to mid-60s in Sweden and about the issues, read  contradictions , that the nation and the world were facing. At times Yellow appears to be an earnest social-political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others interviewing both common people and politicians (e.g. Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All the while, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lenas life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her view of herself. She is a complete person  complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena. It is this that, for me, really gives Yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves. I am reminded of a Bjork music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish. I think Sjöman may have had something similar in mind. While  Jag är nyfiken  Yellow  may not be everyones cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, ebullient, and authentic.#1
1721_8#Had this movie been made a few years later, I would have given it a lower score. However, for 1909, this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today. Just dont try to compare this silent film to later silents--the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century dont look at all like movies made in the 1910s and beyond. This movie is 11 minutes long (about average for most films back then) and is a variation of the Edgar Allen Poe story, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with the story, I wont elaborate further as I dont want to ruin the film. Just suffice to say that its very creepy #1
2001_1#Why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of Roberto Moreiras  Up Against Them All  ( Contra Todos ) at the San Francisco Film Festival?  Its about a hit man,  my friend said.  Well. . . and its Brazilian,  I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical weather, lush rhythms, and a hip gangster plot? Ample enticements no doubt.

9472_1#There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so lets get that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was well, just awful. Call the SPCA. This Cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again. Please, please, no sequel.#0
8451_4#I have to admit that i liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A superior hollywood film. ButNo one mentioned this so far (at least in the latest 20 comments), when it came to the courtroom scenes and Brat Pitt s character followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, i felt cheated. This movie insulted my intelligence.  I am sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this angers me. This movie had great potential. 4/10#0
9281_1#Only the Antichrist could have been behind such a disaster. One only hopes that this irony was the motivating force behind the  film   This movie was so bad, it forced me to register with IMDb, finally, just so I could trash it. What makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such GREAT source material! I have never seen a movie where all the elements were so grotesquely mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its parts. Other than that, I have no strong feelings on the subject ;-) Luckily the first three films are sufficiently adroit as to render this train-wreck of wasted celluloid inconsequential or, at the very most, a study in how NOT to make a film. Viewer beware! May induce vomiting if youre lucky.#0
11209_3#This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. Its silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers. In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight. This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. With more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation.#0
11021_1#Hallam Foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of Oedepus complex afterward. Im not even gonna comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they have made in the presentation. And all the  cute  sex stuff going on. This whole film is an independent cliché. But I do recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine.#0
8075_1#Final Score 1.8 (out of 10) After seeing Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back I must have been on a big Eliza Dushku kick when I rented this movie. Soul Survivors is a junk  psychological thriller  dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up-and-comers like Dushku, Wes Bentley (American Beauty), Casey Affleck (Drowning Mona) and likable star Melissa Sagemiller. Luke Wilson is also in there, ridiculously miscast as a priest. The movie, the brainchild of writer/director Stephen Carpenter, seems like a mutant offspring of Open Your Eyes or Vanilla Sky and movies where a character (and the audience) is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident/death. The movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved. I dont think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with, but SS is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it. The visuals, the script, the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this. Plus, its PG-13 so it doesnt even deliver the gore or T&A to sustain it as a guilty pleasure (even the unrated version is tame). I had heard that the movie contained some  hot  shower scene between Dushku & Sagemiller. As the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost I found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least I would get something out of this. Then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts, they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off. Thats it. People thought this was hot? Soul Survivors is one of those drop-dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have ANY feelings at all toward it. It puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about. In the end it leaves us empty. Carpenters finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and thats probably the most lively part. It will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on USA or the Sci-Fi Channel, due to its low cost and PG-13 rating - and thats probably best for it.#0
9340_4#What a wasted cast. I cannot express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie, and hope I can forewarn you of the same disappointment.#0

6817_10#I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie b/c of the real meaning of family in it, the history of our country, the fun-filled action displayed in the movie. I watch time @ the top about 4 Xs a week and I just love it! I wish that a sequel had of been made to see more of Susans dad in the past and watching how Susan delt with her new baby sister and having no telephone, computers, gameboys or anything of the 21st century. I hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as I did I guess you could say Im a time at the top fanatic and I dont mind. The lil boy in the movie Robert Lincoln Walker was simply adorible I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if hes played in over movies or TV shows?#1
1100_7#- Having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of New York City, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. Hes hoping to find the simple life. But, building a house proves to be anything but simple. As the headaches and the bills start piling up, so do the laughs. Will Mr. Blandings ever get his dream house?  - However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the Blandings find themselves in are easily relatable to today. And thats where the comedy comes in. How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole  wife in love with best friend  subplot. Its really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented.#1
3281_2#I had suspicions the movie was going to be bad. Im a Dukes fan from way back. Have three years of the TV series on DVD. Well I was right. Took the family to see it. I really wanted to see the General jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good. But to sum it up, the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the TV show. Dont waste your money. If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed.#0
3093_10#Why didnt the producers give that show a chance Of all the junk on TV, why didnt the producers give Six Degrees a chance? Will the series go on video? I would love to see how it ends. Put season one on video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited for its return. I set my recorder to tape all of the shows. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show was canceled and Im heart broken. I wish I knew it was going to be canceled, why didnt they tell us? I thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters. The writing was pretty good also. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my all time favorite. I am SO sorry to see it go!#1

5095_7#Kings Solomons Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain)who has spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it is time to return to England and be a father to his son. He finds that his wifes parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit. In comes Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and being held by an African tribe for ransom of the map Elizabeths father had sent her. Elizabeth seeks out Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. The movie holds your attention until the end. Patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the rugged silent good man, anger and strength; In King Solomons Minds his character actually smiles a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again, one in which he doesnt have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong. Maybe a little dancing would help. But this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it.#1
3505_8#I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews but I do know that, as happens often on Amazon.com, there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same, somewhat obscure talking points, almost verbatim. A campaign? Only IMDb knows. That said, Id love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting! -D#1
6396_9#You think youve had it tough? You should check out this film. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a navy diver, should be an inspiration to us all. And significantly, after seeing this film, I learned that what is shown is not even the half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work to date as Brashear. De Niro, as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman in only his second major feature (after  Soul Food ), has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to check out this one.#1
2505_2#Ive seen enough of both Little Richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor Leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was so right as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but fails utterly to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film.  What is going on with director Robert Townsend who started off so well with  The Hollywood Shuffle ? Hes a talented, funny guy but hasnt delivered anything near that first effort.#0
2709_8#To finally see what many consider to be the greatest women-in-prison film of all time, I felt like I had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds. Boy, it sure contained the elements I expected, and delivered so much more. A constant Im discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold, tolerance, and resolve(..not to mention sanity)being tested by their superiors. While most of them were hired for the way they look naked, because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements, something else emerges, other attributes, such as attitude and guts, that I ultimately respond to. I was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time Demme collaborator, cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison, cells and rooms, not an easy task. The prison is appropriately crummy and the girls, despite being quite attractive, look the part of desperate inmates longing, yearning from the very pits of their souls, to escape such horrid entrapment. Steele is superb as the warden, understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far, candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint..notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge. Cales bluesy score is incredibly depressing, while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still fun-and-games..I think Cales score mirrors Demmes handling of the material. Cale and Demmes partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad, isolating, oppressive place, while, almost simultaneously, showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast. My favorite scene happens outside the prison, as two of our girls(..joining forces with a third)interrupt a bank robbery already in progress..the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob! As you might expect, you get naked women in showers, prisoner in solitary, a cat fight, shootouts, attempted escapes which go awry, and other exploitative elements(..such as a horrifying shock therapy session, not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of Belle). Interesting enough, Demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension, understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making.#1
630_2#This movie could be used in film classes in a  How Not to Script a B-Movie  course. There are inherent constrictions in a B-movie Budgets are tight, Time is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. Scarecrows script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but Ill just mention one The Gravedigger. The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. He is shown with his daughter, who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. Why give the Gravedigger a daughter? Why give the daughter a boyfriend? Why introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? Scarecrow doesnt seem to care. Number of Beers I drank while watching this movie 5 Did it help No Number of Beers needed to enjoy this movie Whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level.#0
3573_4#This film is a Pia Zadora special! When viewing it, I was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a Hollywood starlet; in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for B movie or soft porn roles; who says at her casting session  Well of course I do not normally do roles requiring nudity, but if it is artistically necessary for the film . This recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing Pia at such a session saying  Well of course I do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting, but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol . This is probably grossly unfair, the rather sordid tale is the fault of Harold Robbins book; considering the nature of the story Pias exposures certainly do not receive undue attention, and perhaps Pia (who once won an acting award in Butterfly) is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role. Critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing, but this is grossly unfair; the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties. The real problem with  The Lonely Lady  is that the screenplay, like the original book, looks for sensation rather than substance, and nothing can help with this.       The screenplay for this film is abysmal, but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script, tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement. As it was released, my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether I am assessing my personal opinion, or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing. My personal rating for it would be two out of ten; but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended, and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable. Being in a charitable mood, and wanting to make it clear that I am not blaming Pia for my disappointment, I will give an IMDb rating of four.#0
4729_10#A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking off the competition. But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling (and not so) LA actor. It brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit. Its also got a polished look and very adept direction under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that doesnt compromise its production values at any level. The writing is tight, the dialogue first rate. Cassini is an actors actor, and the role really shows off his talents. The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic, and may go down as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it at an advanced screening, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards.#1
7140_1#You already know how painful to watch this movie is. But I wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars. Why the cars should be not only the victim of violation, but also the only true actors and performers in it. So how on Earth you Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions.Stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests. It is painful for those who love cars. It is painful for those who love movies. I want my money back  #0
13_7#The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) locale and lush John Williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item. Unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star  decent  flick, mostly memorable for what it tried to dobring an art house style film mainstream. The small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself, and if well done, will satisfy most grownups. Jane Fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable. I wondered why she wasnt doing a post doctorate at Yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in Waterbury. Robert DiNiros character was just a bit too contrived. An illiterate, nice guy loser who turns out to actually be, with a little help from Janes character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. Ill give it an  A  for effort.#1
11113_3#I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, I write the review to balance unwarranted raves. I found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-forwarding not only through dull, clichéd dialog but even dull, clichéd musical numbers. Whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, but cant carry a movie as a team. Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. Theyre both bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty one-note. The best part of the film, to me, are June Havers beautiful costumes and great body.#0
3766_10#Visual creative epic of inimitable style. PS part 1 is not the better movie. So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel! Its NOT #1
1981_2#Sistas in da hood. Looking for revenge and bling bling. Except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s. I do not remember any westerns like this when I was growing up. What would Randolph Scott say? If he saw Lil Kim, he might say,  Alright! I have to admit that I tuned into this just to see her. Bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick, but these are the cowgirls, and they are fine. I watch this on BET, so I missed the action that got it an R rating, but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured it was Lil Kim in that action.#0
11184_7#Louis Creed, a doctor from Chicago, moves to a large house near a small town, since he is going to be giving classes in the University of Maines. Along with him, is his wife Rachel and their two kids, Ellie and Gage,as well as Ellies cat, Church. Soon, they met their new neighbor,and old man named Judd Crandall.Judd not only warns Louis and Rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house(that is constantly a way used by big trucks) but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house. Judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery, but Rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children, since she has traumas from her sister Zeldas death. A good thing I saw in this movie, is the necessity to talk about death with the children, no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist, and also that avoiding important subjects doesnt help anything. Because of Louis being afraid to be honest with Ellie, confronting her and saying that her cat wouldnt be back again, all the nightmare began.#1
6125_9#Okay, heres what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and I thought to myself, this looks interesting. I rent it and I take it home. Boy was I right, it is interesting. They put serial killers spirits in dreams, in walking corpses and inside every day machines. But this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape, the pot holder, the snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, he put some fun into a killer really not seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. Thats right, I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. Its that level of  cool . I wish some of the puppet effects were better, the mouth movements could have matched better. But I chalk that up to a small budget. The cast does a great job, there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump. All and all, a great story, good effects, great dialog and a great cast. I give JACK FROST9 STARS#1
5789_1#My wife and I really had high hopes for this film, but it was a major disappointment. It was a Native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails at everything he tries e.g. fishing, hunting, in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies. His  visions  are not only ridiculous but in the process he lies to his son numerous times about various obvious things. Words cannot express how bad this film is. The children and wife are very real which makes the film even sadder. I dont get the humor unless you like laughing at other people making a fool of themselves. I dont get how this could have come up for awards. Save your bucks, its not worth the rental.#0
10748_4#Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field? Well this happens about 25 times in this movie(clearly the directors favorite scare tactic). In one of the opening scenes the smooth talking/hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film. Shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and, although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute. After about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clowns history in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie check out the ladies chest.. her ribs go all the way to her neck, it was flat out disgusting. Most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors backyard. The movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically. SIGNED, THE ANSWER#0
8788_10#Well, I am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on DVD. When that will happen, I dont know, but I will grab it when its released. This is one of the more entertaining classic films I have ever watched and I eagerly wait for the DVD.#1
12104_7#Well executed old and very dark house horror. Good set-up which includes the character of Poe, himself, alluding to the story in a London pub. Although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people, it is still most enjoyable. Plus we have the delightful and enigmatic Barbara Steele. There is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout, that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along. DVD originates from US and has a few extras#1
6437_9#A famous conductor decides after a heart attack to go back to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There, he comes in Dutch with the local church choir, that will change his life. This movie tells a story, a beautiful story, about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who devoted his life to music, and who tries to create a calm existence in the village where he was born, while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been till then. Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedish are outstanding movie creators. Go see Så som i himmelen, its a movie that makes you think about life and love, and thats also comforting, in some way.#1
10268_9#This typical Mamet film delivers a quiet, evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man (Joe Mantegna) good. Explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences. The cast includes a number of the players found is several of Mamets films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy), and they do their usual good job. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this film, and have often wondered why she didnt become a more noted player than she has become. Perhaps Im not looking in the right places! The movie proceeds at a slow pace, with flat dialog, yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang-up ending. Youd expect a real let down at the ending, but I found it uplifting and satisfying. I love this movie!#1
9427_1#When I rented  Unhinged , I was expecting a gore movie. The box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release (I now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater). After finishing the movie, I wondered how it could even receive a video release. Dont waste your time on this one. My rating 1 out of 10#0
5165_1#I was looking forward to this ride, and was horribly disappointed. It was not thrilling or exciting in the least.#0
11172_10#Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel(I read the book first and decided to see the movie). First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. The acting is also great and i love the cast. Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. There are also a few corny lines thrown in there (Idk if they were meant to be corny), but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie. Not only will you love it but youll want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to any horror fan #1
9793_7#I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting  guess who  game. The movie, however, needs more Robin in it. He appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest. I always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new Robin character, let alone Knightwing. This movie just continues that bad tradition. The movie spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance which wouldnt be so bad in one movie if the romance wasnt so unbelievable. It is still a good movie if you are a Batman fan and I would recommend watching it.#1
11755_7#I love this movie, but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid. This was a bad director and/or producer decision.#1
8088_3#To make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. In this Eye of the Needle we have none. This Ken Follett story was good but its a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie.#0
6071_8#I claim no matter how hard I seek Ill never find a better movie version of  Othello . If you love Kenneth Branaghs magnificent masterpieces  Much ado about nothing  (1993) and  Hamlet  (1996) as much as I do Im dead certain youll also find Oliver Parkers  Othello  irresistible. Laurence Fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career. He was quite terrific in  Boys n the hood  (1991) - Ive always considered his amusing role of Furious Styles as his very greatest achievement. That was, of course, way before I saw this. He plays the part of Othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant, fantastic job. Irène Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the storys crooked, manipulate villain Iago. Marvelous  Othello  is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeares ingenious works. It deals with his favorite topics crookedness, envy, deceitfulness and jealousy. This movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films Ive seen thats based on William Shakespeares plays.#1
12483_4#This films kind of like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers dont do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it could be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didnt appear in anything else of note. The fight scenes arent too bad either - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims - and theres plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout.  All in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad either#0
547_10#I dont know if Im just weird, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Return to Cabin by the Lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think that I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. I also thought that the cast in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of Stanleys screenplay Cabin by the Lake- it wasnt a completely redundant film of Stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them. - If youre looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not the one for you. However, if youre looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it. Ive probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film. )#1
7525_7#Bettie Page was a icon of the repressed 1950s, when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body. Her acting career went nowhere, but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field. Photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in New York, this made-for-TV (HBO) film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast. The problem is, its emotionally rather flat. Its difficult to form an attachment to the character, since Bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in. The self-serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time, which slows down the film towards the end. But its definitely worth watching for the history of the time, and to see the heavy-handed government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties. 7/10#1
7268_4#Boring, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-involved  this move felt like a bad date. Worse, the tedious art-school direction -- with a heavy-handed use of the whirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up - is constantly screaming to be noticed. Add the thinnest of plots and virtually no dialogue, and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes in. It gets worse instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice-overs AND quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters. Really loud opera music too. Blame it all on the director. The actors are all quite good. The lead actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom. He and the other actors have some tender erotic moments. Even these start to get boring after 5 minutes however, and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a Bel Ami porn job. The stunning college campus architecture as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. How come universities in the US are so bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this film. Youll want to use the fast scan button  a lot.#0
7802_10#I was electrified when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I didnt when finally in South Africa in 1993. It is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in Natal sing Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika, my hair stood on its ends. There is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples.#1
4561_10#I have seen this film three times now, and each time I see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch. I cant say enough good things about the movie, but I will stop here. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on actual events, or just enjoy good dramas in general.#1
6303_1#I had high hopes for this film. I thought the premise interesting. I stuck through it, even though I found the acting, save Helena Bonham Carter, unremarkable. I kept hoping my time spent would pay off, but in the end I was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing. Maybe in George Orwells version there is a message worth conveying. If this film accomplished anything, it has inspired me to read Orwells classic. I find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption. If the film makers message is  the mundane life is worth living , well then, theyve succeeded. I would recommend this film to no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted.#0
2906_9#A hilarious Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. He is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wifes unfaithfulness, falling into depression he stops caring, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Weird characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.#1
9305_10#This a superb self-contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after. Brat Pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice, but in this law-free world they make an alluring ambiance. The film is packed with Our Guys, distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances. The dialogue is a joy. In fact its a new vernacular. One of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation. Highpoints include Billy Idols British loutishness, Ben Londons vulturine brassware, Kyles squirmishness, and the survey of ad hoc philosophies.#1
3706_7#The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street-smart, intelligent, world-weary character. She doesnt have a huge role but she does a great job portraying Lois Harlan as a woman tired of, although used to, covering up for her boss indiscretions.#1
8295_4#I tend to like character-driven films. I also think Hope Davis turns in consistently good work, so I had high hopes for this movie. Those hopes were soon dashed. Except for acting, which I felt was consistently strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema.#0
6281_3#I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like. Definitely, The Broken is not one of those movies. I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations Ive read in prior comments, they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. Its a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. So, you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. Had the clues been planted more in the movie, one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. But though the movie was so slow in pace, it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. Furthermore, if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end, then how come she is the evil one? I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! Theyre supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest, I guess. Horror movies should have blood, screams, intensity, skeletons, body organs and parts. Because that is the real horror and its never away from reality. I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. For instance, the horror movie  Train  with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with  Hostel , it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them. And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message, it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex, TV, safety/being pampered, etc can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial, are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply dont like this genre but this doesnt mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils, ecstasy, leadership lessons (believe it or not!), entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life, as ugly and scary as it may seems, Death #0
2428_8#As an old white housewife I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors. anyone who appreciates his work like in Deep Cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor. Since I think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting. All of the acting is quite good. If you cant take lower Manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorified action shoot-em ups) then this is not a film you would enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburnes usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go at each other some day in a movie.#1
7460_1#Corky Romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific  comedys  ever made. While the sometimes amusing Chris Kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious Undercover Brother his character in Corky is so stupid and so unfunny-which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea. To bad they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the script.#0
8636_7#So-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west. The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitts a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not-all-there companion. This is a good cast and the story moves along, but Pitt isnt belivably scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his better earlier roles.

6133_7#Easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time. I first saw this movie when I was around nine years of age, and I have to say that it scared the hell out of me. Now that Im all growed up, however, I see this movie for what it really is a work of genius. Everyone, or at least everyone with any taste, has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people, even if they wont admit it. I have always found something genuinely frightening about snowmen, so naturally, for a horror junkie such as myself, thismovie was a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is silly, or otherwise void of any intelligence its a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? Anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one-liners and cheap gore. I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately) I will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart.#1

6527_1#Surely no Saturday morning TV kids show was ever done this poorly. After all, those producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well, in this awful offering, they could at least count the money they saved on sets. The script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial, with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline, so the action just plods boringly along. The spaceship props are absurd--a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history. Most are crude drawings, and its all bathed in an often misfocused red light. Even Mohrs bare hairy chest is used as a prop. And its a bad one--as rib-thin as the plot. Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians--and will probably agree completely!#0
5317_2#For the initial 20 minutes or so (I was watching it on a PS2 so Ive really no idea how long it took) Alienator sets up an interesting premise. I dont think Ive seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before. However, interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the alien is a huge body-builder woman in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is patently ridiculous. Add to this the fact that the Alien just kills people by vaporising them, as opposed to doing any slashing as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot. Youll laugh at Alienator, but AT it, not with it. If thats your thing then go ahead and check it out.#0
126_1# I Am Curious Yellow  is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesnt matter what ones political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isnt true. Ive seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they dont exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which were treated to the site of Vincent Gallos throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying)  double-standard  in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally wont see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of womens bodies.#0
3665_1#Apparently, this is what happens when a director allows his 14-year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime; as I said earlier, although Ive always wanted to catch one of Paul Naschys werewolf pictures, this atrocity served as my introduction and, as awful as it most certainly is, I still intend to pursue other entries in the series, albeit very gradually. Despite some high profile disappointments like Joe Dantes THE HOWLING (1981), I love werewolf pictures in general but, to be honest, I quickly lost interest in this films  plot  and just stood there gazing at my TV screen counting its absurdities as it were. There were far too many to mention them here but I have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf persona (i.e. going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed, zombie-like state in the very next one - as if hes on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside, and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to bootand, yes, I did know the reasons for this beforehand), as well as the  Phantom Of The Opera  look of the Wolfstein character! But what do I know - perhaps the elusive full-length version of this mess could very well have been a bona-fide horror classic #0
5971_7#Skippy from Family Ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie. The film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave (using Skippy to help out). And while the plot is corny and cliche, the corniness (for example, an evil green fog taking off a girls clothes)and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious (and great). And of course, theres nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher whos asking what happened to the love song ). Definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh. And while youre at it, make it a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - theres an  evil rocker  (as stated on the video box)driller killer in black leather w/fringe. A must see for cheesy movie fans.#1
6595_9#I happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it, and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, based on certain relics that are found in both places, certain types of ancient sea-going vessels that we know they had available, analysis of ocean and wind currents, and the knowledge that the Incas did, in fact, travel in some undetermined amount at sea. His theory, like so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right. The film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the 100+ day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced. I often wish that Academy Award winning documentaries were easier to find, and this one from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I am sure it was when it was first released.#1
9955_9#Saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community - grit, determination, exuberance, creativity, in your faceness with a dose of desperation. The writing, dialogue and acting is solid and I really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman Raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process. Great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well. All the characters are multi dimensional - none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong. This is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth, hip hop and communities like Jane Finch.#1
2828_9#After tracking it down for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. But Im glad to have watched it. Thank goodness he has grown up.#1
5247_4#This film came recommended as a good action film, which I dont really think it is. I found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow. There really isnt that much action until the end of the film and its pretty dark and hard to see whats really happening. I was sure hoping for something different, but, alas, didnt find it here.#0
90_4#Spoilers Out of the four movies that have been made so far Id have to say that Loves Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope hes got a bigger part and I hope his part isnt so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.#0
8763_2#I thought I read somewhere that this was the last Monogram production, but whether thats true or not it doesnt matter, because if it wasnt, then it should have been. Its a deadly dull affair starring John Carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is experimenting with the aid of his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) in bringing the dead back to life. Every time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they are lying strapped to the laboratory table (big deal). Carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after its dead, and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostlike fashion (wooooooooohhhh). Thats about all she wrote. For an ultra-cheap Monogram quickie, this thing at least actually utilizes a more fancy-schmancy lab setup than is usually allotted. The funniest running joke in the movie is that the  older  doctor Carradine constantly refers to his  young  assistant Shayne as  mboy  when, in fact, Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they made this #0
7437_1#This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent. Full of clichés and a plot that makes absolutely no sense ! I cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10. My guess is they are stooges of the movie maker.  The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. Whats sad is that I never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet I felt short changed. Take my word, dont waste your $8 on this piece of trash. The only entertainment I got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name. In all, highly NOT RECOMMENDED !#0
9185_1#WOW! i didnt know that someone would make this movie! its awful! I have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie. i wonder what the producer was thinking!  this is going to be a big hit, its gonna be a classic  .. sure u dumb s  t anyway dont see this movie, its a waist of time. MY EYES ARE STILL BLEEDING #0
926_7#I dont know why some people criticise that show so much. rating 8/10#1
11202_10#At first, I thought the Ring would be a more than normal movie with its ordinary plot. How surprised was I! Of course, the plot is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, with compassion and anguish. The way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair, the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men, the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies(North by Northwest, the Rope, etc.). The master did it great even before his thirties!#1
1647_10#Excellent. Gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the Western plains with an emphasis on the womans role and place. A moving film, lovingly made, and based on real people and their actual experiences. Low budget, independent film; never made any money. Definitely not the romanticized, unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life.#1
2541_1#Never saw the original movie in the seriesI only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80s, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70s  The Town the Dreaded Sundown .#0
11605_10#The biggest reason I had to see this movie was that it stars Susan Swift, an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress. Time travel movies usually dont interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and creepy. It didnt rely on outrageous special effects and it didnt focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused. This was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all.#1
6003_2#Sundown - featuring the weakest, dorkiest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unfitting, pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, whos every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest. In the end its just too silly to be funny. Sure, it has some amusing moments, but theyre few, and far apart.#0
3848_8#Gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic prone to Catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant, or so it seems. On a trip to Flushing he is seduced by Christine. When he discovers that Christines new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade hes been fancying from afar he decides to stick around. After all, enforced heterosexuality has its compensations. Then he realizes that Christines previous three husbands have all died violent deaths. Did Christine murder them and is he or the boyfriend, Herman, going to be the fourth man? Verhoevens overheated, over-egged melodrama is a delicious blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red. A lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a figment of Gerards imagination. The fun is in figuring it out. Also the fact that Christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish Gerard or the bullish Herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her. In fact, its fair to say Gerards comeuppance cant come soon enough. Super performances, too, from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily Verhoevens best film up to his wonderfully subversive piece of sci-fi  Starship Troopers .#1
5855_1#The film released at the start of 2000 alongwith MELA both disasters So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense Anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort Rekha is adequate, Raveena too is okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is okay in a cameo#0
10880_8#It isnt the worst film ever made, the actors arent apalling and the script and director are not completely inept.  Cut has atmosphere. Its that atmosphere which is actually very unique, and the one really original aspect of the movie, which personally is what makes the film, for me.#1
4457_8#Yes, this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and dancing is superb. I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywoods great underrated stars. I saw this again on A&E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes. Never get tired of these old musicals. Whatever happened to Hollywood??#1
667_2#When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie. So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people. There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them? They had no development what-so-ever, the killer?! Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know its a film, but why would a man who never(or at least we know of) killed any one before, kill a girls family and friends that hes just obsessed over? I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror. 2/10#0
9041_8#Based on fact, this is the story of a teenager named Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), growing up in a coal town in West Virginia where a boys usual destiny was to  end up in the mines.  But Homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets, to the dismay of his mine-foreman father, and the consternation of the townsfolk generally. A misfit for sure, he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets, which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town, so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft-times errant rockets. Unfortunately, most of the town and especially Homers father (Chris Cooper) thinks that they are wasting their time. However, the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the Rocketboys send off their homemade missiles. Only one teacher (Laura Dern) in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize. Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars. Director Joe Johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as Jumanji & Jurassic Park 3 &  October Sky  surely stands above all of his other films. Without any doubts,  October Sky  is his best effort & obviously his best film. Its not only a true story filmed extremely well, but even as a movie, it has every single thing, which is required for a top level cinema. And along with Johnstons extra-ordinary direction, are some exceptional performances. Jake Gyllenhaal was around 19, when this movie was released & he gives a beautiful & natural performance. He is a perfect actor. Chris Cooper as his father, also gives a very fine performance. The same goes for Laura Dern & also she looks beautiful. Even the rest of the performances are extremely well. The background score was fine. Highly inspiring movie, which lifts up your spirit sky high. One of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life. An amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment. Not to be missed.#1
3861_4#Im not a big fan of rom/coms at the best of times. A few have been quite good (check of Dream for an Insomniac), but this one is just more of the same but less. 3 of out 10 (And only cos Im a big Lee fan)#0
3941_9#Young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film of the director/star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I recall years ago Fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and scared he wouldnt live up to the challenge. For a film that captures the drama and romance of the time its set in, you cant do better than Young Mr. Lincoln.#1
6374_3#This movie was a littttle confusing at first. I usually like Gina Phillips, but this one I have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie Ring Around the Rosie, that one also not one her good movies. Jeepers Creepers was way better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. She totally creeped me out and at the end, that was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi(Phillips) who comes to her twin sisters funeral. She stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother(Dunaway) lives at with an Aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen(Dunaway) is kinda sacrificing her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she cant die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, which she tries. Ravens have a weird part in it. When the relations go to sleep, the Ravens eat there organs, so they cant go to sleep. But they do. Basically it all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relations will be buried, but not dead, b/c they have to suffer forever so Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yeah, I hope this helps. If it doesnt, sorry. Love ya.#0
8090_9#When a small hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord. Should the ring end up back in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy Middle Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. This is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film. Another problem is that the evil wizard Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the writers. Overall, I think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice, but there is something charming about it. Ralph Bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories. The film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films, but its still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.#1
3853_1#I think Jason Lee has huge potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star. The plot is awful, the comedy is awful. I laughed twice, I think for relief, because in retrospect, they were fairly lame jokes. I found myself scared for the future of Fletch, and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed, not Lee. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out, instead of this film. Save your time. 1 star.#0
12306_2#This film is a pure failure. I am a Steve Martin fan, but even he cant save the tired idea and swiss cheese script. Think  Police Academy 7  and apply it to a military parody. Yuck. If only I could get my 90 minutes back#0
10349_4#First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine LEngle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the  sporty type  with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine LEngle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleines character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine LEngle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest skipping this movie.#0
2964_1#Laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry folks, but definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen I know it is low budget, but anyway the actors behave like playing in a soap, the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago. I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies, but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished. But at least one good thing the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay - and the score was really worth listening to. The DVD cover promised a lot, but that is by far the best this film has to offer#0
3583_10#This was a great movie but it had the worst ending I think I have ever seen  The actors were great and displayed wonderful talent. The entire story was twisted and unexpecting, which, is what made it entertaining. As good as the movie was, the entire film is judged by the ending, which was terrible! Maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending.#1
8527_2#There are three movies with this animation style that I fondly remember from my youth. This movie,  The Last Unicorn,   Flight of Dragons  and  The Hobbit.  I own copies of both  Dragons  and  The Hobbit  (both excellent) and I hadnt seen  The Last Unicorn  in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I hadnt. What bothered me the most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and often inane. Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. Were not just talking about little things here either; were talking about key plot points! The story itself isnt that great to begin with, but it could have worked had the script been decent. Not even close. On top of that the music was awful! I know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball. This was one of those films that I was going to show to my kids some day, but it just got cut. I dont think I could ever sit through that crap fest again. Disappointed is putting it mildly.#0
2044_1#This movie is bad. I dont just mean bad as in;  Oh the script was bad , or;  The acting in that scene was bad ..I mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public. I wont even dignify it with an explanation of the (Plot??) if I can refer to it as that.I can think of only one other occasion in some 40-odd years of movie watching that I have found need to vent my spleen on a movie. I mean, after all, no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie, do they? Well, yes. Apparently they doand the guilty man is writer/director Ulli Lommel. But the worst of it is that Blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers! Be advised. Leave this crap where it belongs. Stuck on the shelf, gathering dust.#0

5254_3#(Only minor spoilers except as noted). It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. I have to give this film more than one star just because its competently executed, but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made.#0
9559_8#Wow I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best storys Ive ever had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and his son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And 16 year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, thats just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasnt enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for  stealling  their loved ones. And speaking of loved ones, Ive lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been his fiancée, Akane. And thats just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series. Check out the series if you havent, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but Ive had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humor doesnt seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. But either way, its a win win! 10 out of 10 #1

5959_2#A spoiler. If a cop s head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too funny a concept to try and be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised heavily.#0
6243_9#a movie about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating, as only truth can be. It also contains some quite funny bits. Some of the acting is extraordinary, see Maria Hofstätter for instance. The director has tried to depict life as realistically as possible, succeeding. Coherently, the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard-core movie. Although I hardly understood a sentence, I found the vision of the movie in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding, because with the dubbing half the great work of the actors gets lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly hard to duplicate by a dubber. My favorite movie#1
2886_1#Horrible, Horrible, Horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie. Its like a low budget made for TV Canadian movie. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there have been many others out there. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR. ~( . Is it possible to write ten lines? The acting was horrific. It had absolutely no flow. I saw the made for TV movie on the BTK killer and it was much better(in comparison to this one). I am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer they missed by a mile. It appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights.#0
12387_4#Lipstick is another glossy movie failure.I am trying to think of one good thing that I could say about the movie, and I am having trouble coming up with something.I guess the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part.The writing and the script was not the worst that I have ever encountered,but it could have been a lot better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view.The sets were very glossy and nice to look at.The cast was okay. I felt like Anne Bancrofts character was the only feasible character in the entire movie.It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this one.#0
11779_3#I dislike this movie a lot. If youve read the Puzos books, or at least have watched very closely the two first movies (specially the first one), youre going to agree with me. What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined together to make this. A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies. So does Al Pacino, for being the actor he is. But Mario Puzo shouldnt have written this. How come? He damaged all his previous work. What a shame, my friend. The Puzos novel  The Last Don  is a 90s story about the mob, and it is great. We can never tell the same about the plot for the Godfather III.#0
1970_4#Watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time, because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans. Its a mercy that Anthony Quinn couldnt persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey. But it is filled with amusement value, since Yul Brynner has hair, Lorne Greene displays an unconvincing French accent, and the rest of the big names strut about in comic-book fashion.#0
10906_10#I have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never got the chance to meet him but I have never heard anybody say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not. I believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools. I also agree with other comments - what have I got to moan about? He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour. God Bless. I couldnt watch the part that showed his dressings being changed. I have enough trouble with my sons.#1
2620_10#What a pleasant surprise A Disney DTV (Direct to Video) sequel thats actually GOOD.  The Lion King 1 1/2  is a comedy affair that involves everyones favorite meerkat and warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments, until Timon complains that  were not here yet . After fighting over the remote, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience  their story . They start the new movie, and the laughs begin. The Lion King 1 1/2 is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the Shrekification of animation. 10/10#1
11439_8#OK - as far as the 2 versions of this movie. There were 2 people involved in the making - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he really didnt have any kind of say so in the film - just helped with money) - the Adult version was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty didnt like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). Thanks to Ladd films going under, they didnt advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for  The Right Stuff , hoping it would pull them through; and it didnt. SO, this movie never really had a chance. When  Twice  made it to cable (HBO) - they showed the reels with Bills version and John threatened to sue if it was shown anymore (did you notice how the adult version wasnt on for very long?). Showtime got the clean version. The version on the videotape and laser-disc is the version approved by John (who holds more power than Bill). Its a pity, really, as the adult version is actually better and DOES make more sense. But its VERY doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto DVD (or any other format short of bootleg). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this info as I used to be the president of the Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (still have numerous items from the movie - used to own a letter-boxed version of the adult version, but it was stolen - only have a partial HBO copy of it now). 8 stars to the adult version - 5 to the clean version. Any other questions, just ask.#1
9121_10#SPOILERS CONTAINED IN ORDER TO MAKE A OBSERVATION. Are Prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs? Maybe that is why Prince started to run out of steam during the 90s because he ran out of his fathers ideas???..Hmmmm..#1
1026_3#Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had. Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human Kermit the Frog act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just didnt work at all.#0
1670_8#Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels, this show was certainly a naughty one. The presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show, Four-time BAFTA winning and British Comedy Award winning (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this. It had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it. They basically had an adult idea which would either gross, humiliate or humour the guest, but some are not for the faint-hearted. They had women playing the recorder with their parts, men using their dicks to play a xylophone, women weeing upwards in the bath, men with or without pants under their kilts, and many more gross but hilarious ideas. This is just for adults, but enjoy it! It won the BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (Programme or Series), it won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Programme (also nominated), Best Comedy Talk Show, it won an Emmy for episode 18 (?), and it won the National Television Awards twice for Most Popular Talk Show. It was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!#1
10299_9#I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious movies, especially Truman Show. This one is a cross between his VERY funny side, and his serious side. He is of course VERY funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it off with a lot of ease. he is truely a multi-function actor. Overall, I would have to rate this a 9. Good acting, funny script, and some very serious situations make this a very good film.#1
1268_7#Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film. Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. I guess if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it.#1
5202_2#Contains spoilers The movie plot can be summarized in a few sentences Three guys go hunting in the forest. Two of them along other people get shot in the head without explanation. The last guy can stand in the clear, shout and do anything without getting shot. He gets to walk through an old factory and has the evil people walk right into his scope without a struggle. The villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains. The one thing that is a little funny is the extra with the director telling, how they local police didnt realize that they were shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun. If theyd have filmed that, Id be sure it would be more fun to watch then the movie.#0
9889_9#Read Erics review again. He perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than I ever could. Im only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it. I am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library. Liked the movie? You have to read the story and then everything else Garcia Marquz wrote. And, by the way, the original location in the story was Colombia.#1
7644_2#Its been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad.. The acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and Im at a loss for words as to the execution. It was completely unoriginal. O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwoods a pregnant Schwarzenegger!  Im sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only its a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.#0
6538_4#Reading my review of THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, many may assume that Im some 14 year old who thinks SCREAM is considered  classic  horror. This is not the case, as Im 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life. But admittedly, Im a child of the 80s that grew up on slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal, etctypes of horror films - so I do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case, film - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of filmI just dont I can see why THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that I could barely stay awake. Im all for  tension  and  suspense  in horror films - but this film held neither for me. Luckily, I wasnt expecting a whole lot going into this one, so I cant say I was really disappointed - THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that I personally dont typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70s. This isnt a hard and fast rule, but those that I HAVE enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception. Probably a  must-see  for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as I dont really know too many fans of that sort of material, I cant really recommend this one4/10#0
1524_1#Words fail me. This film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight I really wish I hadnt done it. Although I attempted to sit through it until the end credits I have to admit I couldnt last for more than hour, so my opinion could be unfair. However, this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of film-making in order for it to be given a review which is anything but vicious. Please do not watch any part of this film.#0
1653_10#I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the spy genre. My husband and I were captivated by it when it first aired in the US and watched every episode. I tried at that time to purchase the series (I did tape all of it) but was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I purchased and read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, Ill be among the first in line to snap up a copy. Ian Holms portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was amazing. (He is always amazing.)#1
10428_10#Amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that I have long despaired of ever finding. Instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The lead characters are not perfect, and so relating to them as people you could know is easy. The movie is not trying to pull laughs, or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance.  I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, thought provoking, funny look at love that I think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffanys. Will soften even the hardiest heart.#1
4551_1#I must admit I do not hold much of New Age mumbo jumbo. When people  exchange energy  I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem. When energy  is enforced  I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without Nobel prizes. When people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station. If you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety pins in your eyelids, take my advise choose the latter.#0
2841_10#As a fan of Paris JeTaime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I gladly walked out with all my expectations met. It was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four amazing ones out of all the good ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirblys character being handicapped. The best one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris JeTaime. The skits are well-paced, and the film shows how indie films should really be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris JeTaime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely go see New York, I Love You.#1
2009_4#This is not an entirely bad movie. The plot (new house built next door seems to be haunted) is not bad, the mood is creepy enough, and the acting is okay. The big problem I had is that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I couldnt get over how different she looks with her apparently new, big lips. I kept staring at them. They look so out of place on her face! They make her look completely different (and not better). Overall, not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips #0
3247_10#I dont know why I like this movie so well, but I never get tired of watching it.#1
6924_1#If this movie were any worse, it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This nonsensical mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It has been a while since I have seen this steaming pile , but I do remember that I wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved. How anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe. I give it one star because there is not a rating lower. All copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste. No, one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it.#0
6298_9#Great fun. I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film. We came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie. In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this malinski and bellini stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get funnier and funnier. In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next. Until half of the film was over we didnt even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had a good time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think about half of them didnt like it and the other half loved the film. If you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it. Apart from Clooney This movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, but when more ppl have seen it I am sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable I guess, I would give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) #1
5492_3#The folks at Disney have a lot to explain. First and foremost, why anyone thought this lesser-sitcom material would ever make even a half-decent motion picture. In the kooky 60s teleplay, the unique idea of Martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated X-Files treatment. Quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3. Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - take me to your leader.#0
5483_10#I very much enjoyed  The Revolution Will Not Be Televised . It gave me, once again, a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed. It is unfortunate that in Venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when their coup failed; after the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, and The Constitution, and the Ombudsman, and the Electoral Boards, and all Civil Rights, no one took the plotters out behind a barn somewhere and shot them. They havent even gone to jail. The major plotters are living in Florida, carrying on. And the protection that they had was the  Bolivarian Constitution  passed by a large majority of the Venezuelan People. It is not only History that Bites. Democracy can give you one hell of a nip if you let it loose. And in Venezuela it is loose.#1
4203_2#What begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns, almost instantaneously, into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable, but some things are just not humanly possible. I checked the box indicating that my comments contained  spoilers , but theres nothing more I or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven.#0
6345_7#The costumes and make-up were grand, there were some exceptionally funny lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing. Sure this was mostly a movie for kids, but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of Dr Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. Its worth a see, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic, by any measure.#1
6050_4#I simply cannot believe the number of people comparing this favourably with the first film. It moved me to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to cash-in on the success of the first film. The dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original film. A truly awful sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.#0
12375_7#This horror movie, based on the novel of the same name, suffers from flawed production and choppy, amateurish direction, but its nonetheless strangely compelling. Unlike shocker horror flicks such as The Exorcist, this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless dip into a pool of evil. It drifts into horror, which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl whos been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel. Her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world. This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life. The horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly, such as when Alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores. She relives her first suicide attempt, faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians, and sees a cat cut up as a cake. Time and again, shes yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy, through dreams and waking nightmares, all the while lacking the means to cope. In truth, the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel. Will he succeed? In summary, slow-moving yet indescribably creepy, well-acted but poorly directed, and a very typical 70s horror film before the real shockers cut loose. (No pun intended) This movie may not work for those with a short attention span, but it can still send chills up the spine, and still can provide some low-key shock value. It remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil.#1
10886_4#I just watched The Convent for the second time. I had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken Friday night film, some gore, some style, bit of humour and suchlike. I was saddened to find that I could no longer appreciate it much. It seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile. For the record Im not even a huge fan of Night of the Demons, but there were some things I really dug about it. The Convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much. Apart from the main girl (likeable performance from Joanna Canton), the goth girl and a sweet cameo from Adrienne Barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable, festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic, offensive jockhood. The film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that, given the awful dialogue, it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film. The evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes, though not scary their certainly kinda cool, and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy. The stylised direction also occasionally yields good results, although sometimes the camera just moves too fast. All in all, this was a film where for me the shining good points just cant make up for the things I hated. Those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more, but for me it wasnt a good time.#0
4597_8#Having first achieved fame with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983s Project A, a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re-established him as a major star. By the time Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie was reaching its zenith, and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts, brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy. It broke numerous box-office records and inspired a 50% rise in police recruits, but, viewed 20 years on - is it any good? In short, this remains a quality  popcorn  movie  (though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the films final scene) - a potent, boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period.#1
8067_1#First off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling. Most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end  Some people want a movie that makes them  think  through the entire thing, to which I say More power to you   I on the other hand just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stinker, entertainment it is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. Seems that most here agree also. Most of this didnt make any sense, and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and.well I guess you see where this is going. Avoid, this one sucks.bad #0
4601_7#Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery. Some of the stunts here are among Jackies best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably Jackies greatest single fight sequence, more brutal and less comedic then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact. Great stunts, OK movie a fine starting point if youve not seen a JC movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7/10#1
9242_10#Its hard to rate films like this, because do you rate it on production or just fun? So, if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours #1
10998_1#This movie goes beyond just being bad, it is definitively the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film, (if you can call it that).#0
128_7#Von Trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world. So as viewers we think we watch a  true  story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated, often to the point that the movie works disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots/ Idioterne). Of course the Dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlight on Von Trier). As a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washed-out colors, screen overlays, action on different overlays (with the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting). In this movie we can see how good Von Triers handles film as a technical medium. In his later works he seems to step down from this (as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available).#1
8651_9#Kalifornia came out in 1993, just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006. This is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work, like with most of his episodes of the X-Files, Playing God, and Red Shoe Diaries. Aside from that, I think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with Carries photography, its not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies.#1
7307_10#It was  The Night HE Came Home,  warned the posters for John Carpenters career-making horror classic. Set in a small American town, Halloween centerers around serial killer Michael Myers attempts to track down his sister Laurie Strode, and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal waysleaving poor Laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible Michael. This plot out-line inspired countless horror knock-offs throughout the 80s, 90s and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake. The difference between them, and this, is, quite simply, that  Halloween  is the best. Made on a very modest, tight budgetHalloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub-genre of  sexually promiscuous-teens getting stalked by a knife/axe/chainsaw/ wielding psycho .#1
7258_3#This grainy film has a cult following and one of those word-of-mouth features you just had to see. Maybe hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas, Fouke, that knows the legend is true. This tale is told in documentary-style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved. The legend changes with the telling, but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature that traveled along Boggy Creek. Long limbed with three toes and standing over 7 foot tall, this hirsute creature periodically caused damage and frightened the bejeebers out of most of the community. I personally crossed over the small Boggy Creek bridge in 1974, and yes the hair on the back of my neck did rise. Of course it was about 1 a.m. in the rain. By the time I arrived in Shreveport, I was laughing.#0
9113_8#Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of Caetanos men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.#1
434_8#Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male, Im probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own  thing  that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didnt try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen. Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people.#1
10912_7# The Ex-Mrs. Bradford  (1936), starring Thin Man series star William Powell (this film was released the same year as the second Thin Man film,  After The Thin Man,  comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the Thin Man films, but it nonetheless misses. Still, it is a wonderfully fun, highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein. While its not in the stratosphere of The Thin Man  movies (what else is?),  The Ex-Mrs. Bradford  is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery-comedy  who-done-its  of the 30s & 40s.#1
5402_9#Hitokiri (which translates roughly as  assassination ), a/k/a  Tenchu  which translates roughly as  divine punishment ) showcases Hideo Gosha at the top of his form. Do NOT miss this one, or Goshas other classic, Goyokin! Hitokiri is not only one of Goshas best films, its one of the best  samurai/chambara  films ever made, and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever exported. As a final note, perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans, dont miss the last screen appearance of Mishima Yukio (yes, the closeted gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering Japanese military personnel he  kidnapped  in 1970, and had a movie on his life and work made by Paul Schrader), who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable (for an assassin) Shinbei Tanaka.#1
8170_7#As if most people didnt already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry, this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm. A successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man (on their anniversary of all days!) and snaps big time into a furious breakdown. After shooting an attack dogs head off, he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his  slut  of a wife. There are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch. A dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail.  The Dentist  is incredibly entertaining, fast-paced, and laughably gory at times. Check it out #1

12074_10#Joseph H. Lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir. This is surely his best. It seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident. Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it on a low budget. That is the thrill and charm of film noir, the real film noir It is small, convincingly lowlife, and, in this case, unforgettable.#1
8551_8#Ti%s and As , lots of boobies. Some great characters, fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the Amercan Pie franchise. This feels like really OLD SCHOOL. It feels a bit like Porkys for the 2000s. Some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me. So ignore the haters and give this a run and see what you think. Dont expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so.#1
2671_4#  MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS   The titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father (an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next) from a moth-eaten, dime-store mummy and nasty Nazis out to--what else?--build a Fourth Reich. Mistys costume, like those of some other wimmen, gets skimpier as the movie rolls on. The last portion of the movie is devoted to protracted lesbian action; this footage actually gets real boring, real fast, which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it. MISTY gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast, then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft-core sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a throwback to movies made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think if this wonder-work had been cranked out four decades ago, it would have played for years on 42nd Street along with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it is, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to home video. Grab yours, quick, before it goes out of print.#0
1566_3#For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, mis-attribute quotes, incorrect clothing, out of place songs, and (shame shame) incorrect instruments and other boners I just cant think of right now. The flaws come fast and furious so youll have to be on your toes. So,,, watch it for fun, but please dont take it as historically accurate.#0
6443_9#Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. It was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago. I never watched or even noticed it before, because it falls (so typically) in the category  Swedish Movie  and those who rose up (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be sceptical of any foreign movies. Hell what a paradigm shift! The film touches me, because it just keeps up my hope, that mankind can change to a better way. The Swedish village is just a pattern for all areas on earth where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, disguised brutality, but also the ability to have fun, to meet, to sing It takes a trigger from outside to rip off the masks of everyone (who keeps one) and to let them feel that we all are just human beings with the desire to live our own lives. I can never stop to see stories like this, because, that keeps up my hope as described above. The five minutes containing the story of Gabriellas song including her performance is one of my movie-highlights ever! Thank you Kay Pollak just for these 5 minutes, which made me happy #1
5122_3#Ive been scolded and scorned by fellow Christians for stating my disappointment with this movie. I get hounded by statements like these  I cant believe you didnt like it! It was made totally by Christians!   Everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie! It was made by a church and not Hollywood. We should spend our money on movies like this! They only used $100,000 to make the film.   This is by a real church and Christian school in Georgia! A preacher wrote and directed it.  So, apparently, the reason I should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by Christians. That is all that is needed for me to love the movie. I will close by stating that every work - either written or drawn or played on an instrument - shares the artists world view. The world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of  People who pray the right way win ball games, get new cars, conceive when they couldnt, get a raise, and get their house fixed - all within a short time span.  I know. I should LOVE the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it. I think I should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason.#0
4680_4#If asked how I would define the word   Shallow   I would reply   Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production   . If asked how I would define the phrase   Wasted potential   I would reply   Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production   . Bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics . Off the top of my head I can only think of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN getting a lot of critical acclaim .  CRIMSON TIDE too received some begrudging acclaim from critics , it`s certainly one of Bruckheimer`s better films which alas isn`t saying much . The problem I had is the scenario that sets up the story  The Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of Russia leading to an ultra nationalist Russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if they interfere . Maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but I found this set up very unconvincing . It`s not helped by some errors in geography like the French carrier Foch being in the Med ( Wouldn`t the Foch be better positioned in the black sea ? ) or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the Balkans , the first gulf war and even Vietnam . Once again the adjective   Very unconvincing   crept into my mind . The story does improve somewhat when the story proper - A battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway . Director Tony Scott does his best as do the cast , but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . The worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - Nay probability - this film would have terrified me , but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means CRIMSON TIDE has little impact .#0
12315_2#OK Im not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion Steve Martin is not, never has been, and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies America has ever produced. How anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the Phil Silvers character is beyond me. To compound things the exercise was repeated in Martins unfunny attempt to be Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau, another abortive attempt, in my opinion, to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career. Some of your contributers say Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character, to that I would say balderdash , his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be treasured for generations to come#0
10025_1#If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj) then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards. Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out. As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers. People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively. I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie, the actors and the production house both.#0
4722_8#Given the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. It is plausible, realistic, and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a downed American pilot from the ruthless and savage Nazis. We are drawn into strong feelings for the young, impressionable, yet highly courageous boy--who admires the American pilot. If youre looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings--this movie is not for you. If you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent, amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be enthralled by this movie. I truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs, and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end, this movie will be one youll remember for a long time.#1
64_1#This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuValls and James Earl Jones performances are completely wasted on a god awful storylineor lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie.well an actual movienot just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazedamazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasnt even a story. The entire movie takes place in a days worth of time. Thats it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movieif you can even call it a movie.#0
1225_10#DOes anyone know where or how i can get a copy of this film?  Ive been searching for way too long, someone help! Back in 1997 my girlfriends and i were extras on this Long Island based film, and we actually never got to see it. (  i was hoping i could find a copy somehow so i can finally check it out, and share it with the girls! Is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this, so i can stop driving myself crazy? (also, it doesnt matter if its in in VHS format, im still in the ice age myself.) If you, or anyone you know, has a copy of this film please help, i would be willing to pay for a good copy of it!#1
5632_8#Riveting drama, scripted by William Mastrosimone based on his stage play, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked in her car by rapist Joe (James Russo). She manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do. She realizes, however, that Joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives. When her housemates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are off at work, Joe pays her a visit to finish what he started. After Joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways, she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him. Knowing full well shes in another  his word against yours  situation and that no rape technically took place, she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to Pat and Terry what his intentions were. 8/10#1
10383_10#I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of living in New York. I went on to live there for the next 26 years,but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small TV movie. It was part of a PBS series as I recall, and Ive never forgotten it.  There has to be a video of this movie? Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video?#1
8284_8#This is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word horror in order for it to be appreciated. The main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and, as with most younger children, he gets frightened easily. Mainly because he simply doesnt understand things, like why his father is hardly ever there for him. From watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the little boy doesnt. Also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods, as it is established early on in the film, that the family is from the city. Also, in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer, then get held up, then they argue with the locals about it, and the little boy surely didnt find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all. Rated R profanity, violence, and a sex scene#1
8303_10#This film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage. Straight from Lethal Weapon Gary Busey wisecracks, shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it cant help but amuse and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream vans and if they arent good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best oneDanny Trejo. And if you dont know who Danny Trejo is then you probably wont like this film.#1
620_10#The beautiful story of Stardust is written by by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and its really a good story. I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom fan and yet its totally unique and stands up on its own. And I feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I wont spoil it for you. Its a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. Its charming and I feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. Its simply magical. Its a true classic fairy tale, the likes of which I havent seen in cinema since the 1980s.#1
9688_9#I approach films about talking animals with care. For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didnt exactly fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising. A minor gem.#1
10549_9#I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it gets wide release because I want to see it again! It is a character-driven film, and Andrew and David are more than up to the task. Any discussion of the plot might be movies. It had the audience laughing the whole time. See it if you can. (I particularly liked the  Candy bar! Candy bar!  scene.)#1
4429_1#What a piece of stupid tripe. FOX has lost it, IMHO.#0
8734_1#Maybe Ive seen one too many crime flick, or maybe I dont take the right drugs. Its a bad rip off of  M  the classic Fritz Lang film starring Peter Lorre. Youd be SO much better off renting that instead.#0
5650_2#William Shatner in small doses is tolerable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation, and in that moderately amusing, it has been seen fit to enlarge his role and overdo it. Just as occurred in the original Star Trek series. I guess I will never understand American humour, which frequently goes over the top to get the message through. I vote with my feet. I no longer watch the show, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast were good. It is pity that Shatners overdone role also, affects James Spaders performance. But the majority demonstrate the way society is going, I guess. I dont travel the same routes. Frank#0
9611_8#This was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie, and quite true to my own experience of bulimia. It was actually well-researched, and I can only assume it was written by someone whos gone through a similar experience, because it had all the little details. The characters were quite well-drawn, and the performances by Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think what I like most was that they made them specific and smart, and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for Beths bulimia (it wasnt some  diet gone out of control, caused by the pressures placed on girls by the media, pressures were not actually going to address ). Her mother wasnt completely clueless - too often on television theyll take an issue that EVERYONE has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who dont ( Diabetes? Whats that? Oh, my world is all askew, doctor, please explain it all to me as if Im a small child , etc). It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didnt see the signs. And the scenes where Beth was throwing up werent OVERLY melodramatic and sensationalist, and concentrated more on bulimics need for secrecy, and their out-of-controlness. The scene where Beth tells her mother shes bulimic wouldve made me cry if there hadnt been other people in the room. And can I just say again that I really like Mare Winningham. Shes great.#1
3856_10# De vierde man  (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers of the eighties. This last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like  Total Recall ,  Basic Instinct  and  Starship Troopers  is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (Jeroen Krabbe) going to the seaside for recovering. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and starts a fatal love affair with her. He becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances The cast is also outstanding, especially Krabbes performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career ( The Living Daylights ,  The Fugitive ). If you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, dont miss it #1
563_10#The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (excluding the few days Mann worked on Night Passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances), The Far Country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption, fighting it every step of the way. This time hes a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by John McIntires larcenous judge of the Roy Bean school of law and order. Stealing them back and taking them across the Canadian border, he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims As usual with Mann theres an exceptional use of high country locations, though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground, and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (though Corinne Calverts young romantic interest veers to the irritating). Sadly the great cinematography of the Canadian Rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average DVD transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an extra.#1
4372_2#I LOVE Don Knotts, let me just say that up-front! He is an enormous talent and the best at what he does, which is portray a nervous, lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority. He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the Reluctant Astronaut, but the film is pretty dull, really, even though as a kid my brother and I delighted in watching this and his other films. Its still worth watching but really its a film that is best enjoyed by children. Id categorize it as 100% family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night. From an adult perspective, one thing I think that is great about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings, the hope, the optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how suave and studly Leslie Neilsen was back then. Only complaint about the story is Roys love interest, a rather threadbare, unlikeable woman who cant give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot -- if youre like me, youll be hoping that he gives her the shove-off at the end. Beware -- youll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching, its that catchy.#0
9177_10#I have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel  Jane Eyre . Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane. Ive seen other versions, but none compare to this one. The best one for me. I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again. The last time I saw this one was in 1984 when I was only 13. At that time, I was a bookworm and I had just read Charlotte Brontes novel. I was completely enchanted by this miniseries and I remember not missing any of the episodes. Id like to see it again because its so good. -)#1
4863_2#Why oh why dont blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point? Everyone in the cinema, young and old, was there to see talking animals make jokes, and whilst they did that we were all happy And then, as with Lost In Space, came the two killer blows - plot and sentiment. Who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether Eddie Murphy made up with his daughter? Not me, thats for sure.#0
4615_1#I may not have the longest of attention-spans, but this is the second movie I have refused to see all the way through, and I even bought it on DVD because of its  classic  status.  Once again, I repeat myself. This is the second movie I have refused to watch all the way through. The first was  Exterminator . I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1/10#0
7086_10#NB Spoilers within. This great movie is  about  so many things, all of them successfully sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story. This is one of the great achievements of the 90s, a true favorite of mine, and sure to hold up for a long time to come.#1
11684_8#After hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat, Serling continued to go about introducing viewers to The Twilight Zone in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode. The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine is one of the more understated episodes, focusing on an aging movie stars inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes. Because of this approach, the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story. The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine gets better with each viewing. The top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past, even though we can never return. Except in the Twilight Zone.#1
9409_8#A chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out, but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries. In this delightful Ealing Studios comedy, Guinness is marvelous as the mild-mannered but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with her sensual voice, plays the love interest; Parker is her harried father. Thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry. While telling an engaging story, the film also raises some intriguing questions about science, the economy, and politics. It is adeptly directed by Mackendrick, who would go on to make  The Ladykillers  and the sublime  Sweet Smell of Success  later in the 1950s.#1
6447_8#A famous orchestra conductor, Daniel Dareus, suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting a concert. Suddenly, we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has left years before. Since he left so young, and having his name changed contributes to give him a new persona. He has bought the old school building where he plans to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new abode, but no, Daniel puts up with the harsh winter in his own way. Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music one hears. Harald Gunnar Paalgards cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty.#1
9463_10#I loved  Dan in Real Life . A wonderful journey-to-love story like Youve Got Mail or While You Were Sleeping, but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes, and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up.  =================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Grade A#1
4323_9#This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right. The plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book (but really how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing a film version first? I know of only a few).  Its ADA and Rick not  Kate   and you get all you need of the Rouncewell subplot.#1
1256_3#This film is another of director Tim Burtons attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision to the screen. He has done it with `Batman, `Sleepy Hollow and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for todays mass viewership. This film is a great disappointment. It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it a 3/10. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10. However the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is. Of course its true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.#0
3786_9#Ying, a Chinese girl who speaks Czech, invited us to screening of a Czech movie (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotá&345;i (Loners, 2000) and it was pretty good. The seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people, but it is fun.#1
12157_1#I couldnt believe this terrible movie was actually made at all. With the worst actors you could find, the worst script written (Mark Frost & Sollace Mitchell) and by far the worst waste of time in viewing. I wont belabor the story as its really not worth it. But I will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story. As to the story, it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did. That in reality the wife couldnt defend herself against a little bitty of a thing. That the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all. That the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up. And the final result of the film is an insult to justice, movie codes, and the male species. The theme of this mess is let women do as they wish, kill whom they want, defend the killer and get away with it, while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim. Hard to believe that Sollace Mitchell, the director and a man, would even want to make this dribble. And again this loser is shown. Why???? Cant you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie? Are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo Jordan Ladd again and again? Get her off TV, films and out of sight. Shes just terrible in every sense of the word. Phew #0
9381_2#Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. Possibly there is something there that I totally missed. Otherwise Im assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art.#0
7312_1#I dont really know whether Cabin Fever is supposed to be a joke or a film But as far as I know, its much closer to being a joke than anything else. A few years ago, the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre, thus giving birth to the Scream series. A list was given in Scream, of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable, and the characters in Scream ended up doing exactly the same things, which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre, and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different, either full of irony towards the genre, self-derision towards the film itself, or at least different in their dramatic process than all the  old  films that responded to the same tired criteria. In seeing  Cabin Fever , alas, many will see how unoriginal, serious, pretentious, boring and even not scary some supposedly  scary  films are now, even a few years later. First of all, this film lacks originality in a way few others do. It has been said several times, how little imagination horror directors have today, remaking remakes of foreign sequels, but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesnt seem to be an  hommage  to anything, it seems to be, simply, a ripoff. Whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the films story wont be once again, we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties, who wont think rationally when placed in front of a problem, will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it. Not much excitement there either. For the umpteenth time in a horror film, they are tempted to kiss, make love and just basically have fun, all sorts of things that dont really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously. Secondly, this film is unimaginatively serious. Every situation the characters are in, every dialog, every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying. Nothing in the way the film is directed, written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm, which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisible-never-heard-of-before-flesh-eating-virus (no laughs please). I wont even bring up the acting, since there are no actors in this film. The cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director. Thirdly, and this will strike whoever has seen a  good  horror film before, the screenplay is absolutely empty. Nothing really happens, some actions are repeated several times ( lets try to get help! ), nothing makes sense, either in the facts, the psychology of the characters, or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film, which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters. In the end I will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it. Gallons of fake blood, whether they are being vomited, squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds, never were enough to scare an audience. Such major features as screenplay, ideas, and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary. If I wasnt considering it to be a total failure, I would agree to reckon that the film has one talent it is filthy disgusting to watch. Yet being grossed-out and being scared are two very different feelings, let it be known. I would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first, why not from the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, films made by Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Sam Raimi, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Roger Corman, William Lustig, John Carpenter it might not only give a good definition of what is scary, or self-derisory horror, but also convince viewers that  new  isnt necessarily  better . A good example related to the film is the few tracks composer Angelo Badalamenti provided for this film, even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions, they are below anything he has ever done before.#0
1488_1#I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie ismy cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this. Not the worst acting Ive ever seen, but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to be desired. There wasnt a single scare moment in the movie, with the exception of when they were watching the movie Halloween on the TV. All around, it seems like it couldve been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss as I didnt recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I couldve said oh yeah, there she is. Im so glad I saw this in a hotel and didnt pay for it as Id be real ticked if I had payed a cent to see this. I normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this one is an exception. Its so bad that its not even that amusing so-good-its-bad.its just plain bad.#0

Based on the true story of US Marine Sergeant Albert Schmid  Pride of the Marines  showed what we were to expect from the tens of thousands of wounded US Servicemen coming back from the war. We get to see how it in many ways was far more difficult for those fighting the war to adjust to a peacetime America when they left something, like in the case of Al Schmid, behind on the battlefield. Als battle with his personal demons was a lot harder then the Japanese that he fought in that they were part of him and thus had to fight himself in order to overcome and eventually defeat them. Despite the help that he got from both Nurse Virginia and his girlfriend Ruth as well as his Navy doctor-who has a striking resemblance to actor Gregory Peck-it still was up to Al to overcome the fears that he faced. Fears which he and only he had to both battle and overcome, like he was told by everyone in the movie, all by himself.#1
4698_1#I mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car? So what if their ten, Its way too immature for a little kid to sing about  being my women  I mean seriously! The name is pretty corny too, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants??? HOW CREATIVE.I dont get why they need a TV show I mean most artist dont really need a TV show about themselves, especially the naked brothers band. Heck how many of them are in the freaking group. And seriously whats with the movie? Jeez Nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously The naked brother band? SO many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the Naked Brothers band, its a stupid, uncreative show that should not be aired onto TV.#0
3356_10#Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched together  Ceravamo tanto amati  on a summer night we liked it, but we didnt love it as we loved  A special day . I believe Ettore Scola is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing. And so, yesterday night, my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. Theyre both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is an housewife married with a fanatic Fascist, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families. Gabriele is simply an Anti-Fascist. They spend together a special day, that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini. I dont want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film #1
7475_7#After reading some quite negative views for this movie, I was not sure whether I should fork out some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I havent seen the original movie, but if its better than this, Id be in heaven. You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable. The movie isnt perfect, but its a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on a diet of Hollywood gloss, should be a revelation.#1
11466_2#This film cant make up its mind whether its message is  humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless  or  dont ever go in the water again.  A fisherman (Nolan) is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally (ACCIDENTALLY mark you) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow -- and I use the word in all senses -- who is obviously a sick psycho-bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself. (I doubt it was her first.) When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self-inflicted wounds, her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt, kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan. Obviously as among humans, total psychos date other total psychos. The only message one can walk away with is  If you see an orca whale, ever, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way, he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you.  #0
3387_1#On Broadway, A Chorus Line was pure magic. From the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale, a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show, we were totally engaged - captivated by the intensely personal stories, some funny, some clever, some stirring, of this chorus line. The movie is another matter entirely. The focus is now on the director - and WHAT an ogre he is! Every time the film switches to Michael Douglas, there he is with a bitter, sour expression, barking out questions and orders, screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance. Yikes  That changes the dynamics of the story. On Broadway, the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence, but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong/fragile/intriguing/hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity. There is a reason this work won the Pulitzer Prize! And actually in one of the only moments the director appears, he is there to comfort the young Puerto Rican Dancer after we hear that dancers heart-breaking story. He appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection/ concern for Cassie. But in the movie, from the second Douglas director starts bitterly barking orders, the chorus line members stories become secondary. Its like they are in a lousy profession, where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show, is jaded, exhausted, furious at having to audition these chorus members. On stage, there was ALWAYS the excitement of the show. Here in the movie practically from the word go, you feel sorry for everyone involved. During the course of the musical, we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well, and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job! But of course that couldnt happen. But in the Finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage, sometimes reflecting us in the audience, in our hearts, and we know, also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected, they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much, bringing magic to the theatre. In the movie, after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis, that magic becomes totally diluted. All we feel (even with the exact same curtain call), is that some of the members got a job with a mean-spirited director. So they all come on the screen and are dancing again. Big deal.#0
9018_3#This is a formula B science fiction movie, and the director made no bones about it. It is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team. Everything done is stuff youve seen many times before. It is a weak script, with no real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotype characters and situations. The director attacks this by just making it a formula movie, with no attempt to fool us, and that gives this movie a mild appeal, but it isnt something youre likely to remember a while. It is best seen while youre cooking, cleaning, working out. Sort of mindless fun. It has its place in entertainment, but it certainly isnt something you sit down with friends to watch, unless youre all just drunk and dont care. The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I dont think it is as crappy as most people, but I am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular. That really eludes me, as I see no attempt to even make this a memorable film.#0
6095_1#ive seen a movie thats sort of like this, were a transsexual drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces. he then slices there tongue and eats it. i prefer DAY OF THE WOMAN also known as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (its one of the best cult movies ever) check out this link http www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/#0
6989_7#This movie was featured on a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this film, I dont think about that wonderful TV series. I believe this was a surprisingly good early 40s horror flick, with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. I actually enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides, an old hag, and her two bizarre sons, one a giant idiot, the other a comical dwarf(Angelo Rossitto from 1932s Freaks). I also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent film is its plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. I dont want to spoil any of this film, so go out and rent it, or, better yet, buy it for a couple of bucks.#1
8860_3#OK, as everyone has pointed out, this film is a complete dog. To some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised (or darkened down to near invisibility) to escape the censors X-rating; but the film has many other flaws as well. I also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves stronghold. There are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly, but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days. Shouldnt be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti-lycanthrope weapons.#0
9579_4#Heres a horror version of PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT (they wish!) starring Melinda/Mindy (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert dweller who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). He ends up in a South-of-the-border prison run by the sadistic Chief Screw (an overacting Robert Englund in a toupee). She and her beloved pet poodles end up in hiding at a gas station convent until theyre transformed by a newly fallen meteor. The dogs turn into obnoxious drag queen  bitches  and Candy develops a VERY long, talking, killing forked tongue she cant control. Thugs looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications. Blame director/scripter Sciamma, who thinks the outlandish premise alone is enough to sustain laughsbut his vulgar gags, annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, lots of garish colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert locales. Luckily for Sciamma that Clarke is in his film, because she alone keeps you watching.#0
12348_9#It helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place. First of all, these ladies are NOT geisha, they are oiran (prostitutes)in the Yoshiwara-type  green houses , circa 1860, give or take.. This should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware. The film deals with issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps most importantly, how people deal with adversity, both their own and that of others in their immediate environment. That plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music, make for a lovely ride. Just plug it in, suspend your disbelief and enter their world. You wont be disappointed.#1
6178_7#Mitchell Leisens fifth feature as director, and he shows his versatility by directing a musical, after his previous movies were heavy dramas. He also plays a cameo as the conductor. The musical numbers are interesting and some good (the Rape of the Rhapsody in particular is amusing) but the drama unconvincing and faked - three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been a lot better.#1
11042_7#In a penitentiary, four prisoners occupy a cell Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the drag Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégée, the retarded Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six months sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison, when they find the truth about Danvers fate.  Maléfique  is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French low-budget horror movie. The story is practically in the same location, does not have any clichés and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene. I am a great fan of French cinema, usually romances, dramas and police stories, but I noted that recently I have seen some good French horror movies, such as  Un Jeu d Enfants ,  Belphegor  and  Dead End . My vote is seven. Title (Brazil)  Sinais do Mal  ( Signs of the Evil )#1
8079_3#Yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can. Really. Dont waste your time on this one.#0
6474_3#This was the first sequel Id seen (apart from Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original. I was horribly disappointed. However, all in all, it could have been worse-its not as bad as certain other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But its not in the same league as the original. But it for your collection if nothing else but if Disney go on like this theyll lose all their older fans.#0
2644_1#The Sentinel represents everything about the soul-lessness of Hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. I cannot possibly think of one good thing about it, its all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, undeserving public. If youre a glutton for punishment then dont let me stop you. But it IS time and money you wont be getting back.#0

8601_10#My observations vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well, and got even with naive Nelson. Boat crashing into his balcony served him right. Costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well, especially by todays standards. 1942 costume designer did great job. Main song theme just lovely. 15/10#1
1_7#If you like adult comedy cartoons, like South Park, then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school. Theres the idiotic principal, Mr. Bip, the nervous Maths teacher and many others. The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henrys Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Ponys Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers Mark Perry and Blunders Nina Conti. I didnt know this came from Canada, but it is very good. Very good!#1
3496_1#I remember my parents not understanding Saturday Night Live when I was 15. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember, and find I understand many of the things my kids love. But this is pathetic. I cannot say I have seen any by Sarah except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see her as anything special. But this show is just so far below what I expected from her. The IMDb write up made it sound like potential. So, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I turned it off half way through. Anything else is better that that. Jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is inly moved to turn you off. I just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy. Only good thing I can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here, saving other shows from such an embarrassment.#0
2570_10#Well, this is probably one of the best movies Ive seen and I love it so much that Ive memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks wind) and even with the script in my head I still like to watch it for Jerry Lee, that German Shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see whos smarter. The tag line holds true as well. Not to mention the acting is great, though Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (Check filmography under CSI if you dont know what I mean). Its too bad that this movie only contained the single issue Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with, it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had up their sleeve.#1
27_10#Emilio Miraglios  The Red Queen Kills Seven Times  (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed. First of all, and of paramount importance for me, it has a complex, twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end. The story, concerning a series of gruesome murders (you already know how many from the films title, right?) that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, is an involving one, and the murderer, a red-cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman, is both frightening and memorable. Every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses, and here we have quite an assortment, headed by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her earlier roles, Sybil Danning, as a lustful tramp at Barbaras fashion house. Another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days. Gorgeous scenery? Check again. Filmed largely in Wurzburg, Germany, the picture is a treat for the eye indeed. OK, OK, but what about those murders? After all, isnt that what gialli are all about? Well, Im pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings, shootings, impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes outnot to mention the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and LOTS of em, too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a hunky leading man for the female viewers. As I said, a perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD is from the fine folks at No Shame, and you know what that means a gorgeous print and loads of extras, to boot! Thanks, guys #1
514_1#This is one of the most insipid, lackluster, unoriginal, and pointless movies ever made! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project didnt even try to make an appealing movie. This is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think is the best film of them all. As for this waste of film stock, Burt Reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors arent given very much to do, the car races are obviously stock footage, the humor is uninspired, and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours.  Stroker Ace  is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it.#0
9195_1#Laid up and drugged out, as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi-oblivion, I happened to catch this movie on cable. I wouldnt want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or  heaven forfend!  that I watched it STRAIGHT. (Movie Maniacs, visit www.poffysmoviemania.com)#0
8917_2#The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzches work and personality, psychoanalytical techniques and Viennas history. Take a well-know genius you have not read, describe him as demented, include crazy physicians to cure him, a couple of somewhat good looking women, have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache, have every character speak with the strongest accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one (Freud), mention a few words used in the genius works, overdo everything you can, particularly music, and you are done. Audience, please stay away.#0
9755_2#This 1974 Naschy outing is directed by Leon Klimovsky, and a cursory glance at the publicity photos and packaging might lead you to believe that this medieval romp lies somewhere between  Inquisition  and  Sadomania . Sadly not. This is a strictly PG affair with tame torture sequences, no nudity and little edge at all. Naschy (of whom I am a fan) struts his stuff as Gilles de Lancre,  antiguo Mariscal de la nacion . Sadly he is more pantomime villain than anything else. One gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him (and it) done all before. Strictly therefore for Naschy completest only.#0
4317_10#I really liked this film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general, and people tooone of the things I like about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the positive vibes from the film, there are other reasons to like Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has an outstanding castKevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day.#1
5091_8#Watched both parts twice. Enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very believable as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I do admit that I would have preferred seeing someone else as the  Lady in Distress . Alison Doody should stick with modern and not period pieces. She didnt have the look of the woman of the 1800s. The rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well. I am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. Age is inevitable, but lets not hide from it. A man at 50+ can be much sexier (and , Patrick truly is sexy) then a green youth, no matter how pretty. Hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile.#1
1681_7# The Case of the Scorpions Tail  has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie. The story is standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $1 million life insurance policy. The widow heads to Greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her. There are plenty of suspects, including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widows lover. Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in  Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key  and  Who Saw Her Die? ) is a stunning-looking heroine. Its one of Martinos best films.#1
12422_1#I rented this film to see what might be a bloody, non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks, he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard, I swear! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back. There is no good fight scenes at all, the punches are two inches away from a person. Characters personalities change in matter of seconds. One guy is a bad and in the next scene hes good. The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick. I hated this film.#0
1657_1#This movie was worth five punches on my  hurter card . I saw this while stationed in Virginia in the mid 70s. I saw it alone so I was not distracted while I watched it. It sucked. It was the most ridiculous, total waste of celluloid Ive ever seen. I know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome. I offer you this if it was so awesome what was its box office take? End of discussion.#0
10278_7# House Of Games  is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes, stiff acting, final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head.  House Of Games  does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. Of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that were dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate. So it stands to reason that we never really know whats going on, even though we think that we do. But thats what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities. It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it. The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort  Marnie , considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Masters more thought-provoking works. One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouses character being the same as Tippi Hedrinsten year later perhaps. Both are strong-willed loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. As Crouses repressed, up-tight character says,  Whats life without adventure?  Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks #1
11491_3#This is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians (I am both). During the first half of the twentieth century, sadly, Black Americans were usually not allowed into White theaters. As a result, theaters catering to Black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the Black experience and showing Black actors. In many cases, the films were essentially similar plot-wise to standard Hollywood fare, but with a much, much lower budget--and usually horrid production values. You really cant fault the film makers--they just didnt have the money and resources available to the average film company. As a result, they had to make due with a lot less--including an over-reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again, no money for re-shooting scenes and a need to get the films done FAST! This film tried very hard to be a Black version of a Gene Autry film--starring Herb Jeffries instead. Jeffries was a light-skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films. In each, he sings a little, fights a little (though VERY poorly) and loves a little--everything you need in a cowboy. Believe it or not, Jeffries is STILL alive at age 96. By the way, in an odd bit of casting, the very tall, lean and almost white-skinned Jefferies is paired with short, dumpy and exceptionally dark Mantan Moreland.as his brother  Also, Spencer Williams may be familiar to you. He played Andy on TVs  Amos n Andy .#0
12398_8#What was always missing with the Matrix story was how things came to be in the real world. Say no more, because this part of the story covered most of the bases. What was truly interesting was how political it was, maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde, who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity. What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown. We as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often, letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people cant believe the contrary. Well represented and put together, this a true testament to how illogical humans can be.#1
1009_8#Fact Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi TV series. So for those who decide to brush of Stargate SG-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show, dont. Stick with it and youll see what Im talking about.#1
10040_10#For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Roses and Jacks story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart wont go on from this one.#1
4198_7#From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work (RICHARD WIDMARK) stealing from a womans purse (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating to watch. Partly its because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast, the B&W photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fullers direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston film about a heist that goes wrong--but the payoff is not quite as strong. This one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time. Good noir from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.#1
9388_4#Former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession. His assignment to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in Californiaand apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement) doesnt give off the impression of having high regard for the 40s films his  Chandler  was borne from; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this 70s variant on the private dick archetype, but the movie doesnt have any snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and Carons hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil.  1/2 from     #0
8939_9#A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash Broadway play about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two  colored  sisters who lived past the age of 100. Wonderfully played in their old age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, respectively, they tell their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times reporter. The flashback and present-day scenes dont have as much inspirational value in them as in the book, but really are powerful. However, certain aspects of the sisters lives, such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their fathers stern personality are not presented clearly. You need to read the book to fully understand these things. Which is just as well, because the books just as great! Aside from those flaws, its wonderfully done and performed, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational movie.#1
11112_1#Wow, how bad can it get. This was seriously bad. Not in terms of the gore - which was mainly laughable CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. Overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea. What could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters at the end) is ruined in favour of look at mestyle self-conscious directing. This film wasnt made for and audience - it was made for a CV - a deeply selfish motive.#0
2457_8#When you are in a gloomy or depressed mood, go watch this film. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting, and it is very encouraging, in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective. The contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity - shown at once, in the same characters, at the same time.#1
3994_8#I went to this movie only because I was dragged there and I would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and I felt out of place. However, the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people. The characters were all very real and believable and I found myself discussing the film, the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards. There are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better. All in all, this is a great and valuable film - slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream. Its a thrilling and interesting movie experience.#1
12230_4#Michael Williams, who works for BBC, finds a somehow impressive Italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled DIABOLICAL ART A DOCUMENTARY. But since his wifes mysterious death her daughter, Emily, has been emotionally disturbed, so he goes Spoleto, where the problematic picture is, with her and her nanny, Jill. And there is a Countess, who is also a psychic, and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named Emilia was executed. Michael doesnt believe her story, but after that Emily has hysterical spasm and Jill is killed This Italian film is, of course, almost innocently influenced by THE EXORCIST, but this one is much cheaper, much simpler,and in a sense, much dirtier. First of all, it should be said this film is full of confusion. For instance, the story shows Emily is a reincarnation of Emilia. But when Emily sees her in the flashbacks, she perceives her exclusively from a third-persons point of view. But if she is the reincarnation of Emilia, she should and must see the past from nothing but Emilias point of view. Confusions of this kind, which the film has many, are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly, rather than ambivalent, to specify its own quasi-Freudian theme, namely, pre-adolescent girls one-way incestuous wish. To make matters worse, this film also has characteristic problem (if not confusion); every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and/or believable living human. Regarding Emily (or Emilia), she is after all a child, and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness. (And according to the Freudian theory, every girl wants to have her fathers child(ren) in her own way. In this sense, Emily is not exclusively pathological; only her way of excluding other women from her fathers love is problematically pathological. But, as I already mentioned, this film per se is too cowardly to be Freudian.) The problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as Emily is. And because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down-to-earth, and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way. In addition, special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable. Although Stelvio Ciprianis music is noteworthily beautiful (indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone), the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap B-film which can disappoint even the 1970s-Italian- horror-film-lovers.#0
10985_1#I dont know what Margaret Atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book. Ive always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works. I am aware that the translation of book to movie isnt perfect but this movie was the worst ever. The names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it. I feel like I lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie. This really should have been a mini-series to tell the story the way it was written. The actors for Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well-chosen even though I was skeptical at first about Mary-Louise Parker. I only wish theyd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all.#0
2319_3#Lot of silly plot holes in the film. First we see him watching his master practice kung-fu, and die in the midst of his practice. Thats fine with me. And then at the end of the film, we see him use the kung-fu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid. Is that even possible? I dont think so. In short, this is a Jay Chou-flick (instead of the usual  chick flick ). Watch it only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of IMDbs top 250 films of all time, then this film is not for you.#0
4272_2#These kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, and a thousand made-for-TV movies are some examples of this. But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few plot twists, Unlawful Entry plays everything by the book. And were it not for the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a Danielle Steele miniseries. Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power. At first empathizing with Carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. But soon enough, the cops wants Carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way he can (which is pretty easy when youre a cop, and when youre the cop who has installed the guys security system in his house) in order to take over and presumably, get his wife. It seems less ends-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove his power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end. And the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if youve seen enough of these movies. From the  shocking  moment our main, naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-hes-not-really-dead finale.#0
10100_1#usually I support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and toleranti tend to support everybody, because their efforts are worth see it only if you really dont have anything else better to do. ANYTHING is better.#0
6532_4#The film begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in Space near out planet. When its retrieved, one of the crew members is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member. PS--When you watch the film, pay careful attention to Dr. Tremayne. He looks like the spitting image of Dr. Quest from the  Jonny Quest  cartoon! Plus, he sounds and acts a lot like him, too.#0
917_10#I watched this in July and even with the Christmas theme, found it touching and sensitive. It is not for someone with a reality-mind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes dont make sense. William Russ did a grand job as Hank. I have only seen him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer where he played a weak character. But in this one, the expression in his eyes throughout, as Hank considered the things that were happening to him, was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one where Hank realizes who Max really was in his life. Its not for everyone..especially those who arent into feel-good movies and this is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this one. But I think it is well-worth re-watching, which is why I taped it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs. )#1
9831_1#I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a  good  message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The films only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the  Time Machine  probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.#0
2122_4#Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccinos project is rather mediocre. The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical. Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritus Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks. The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easily on through the movie. Thats too bad, because Seven Pounds could have been as authentically  good  if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands.#0
6858_2#John Hustons Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery OConnors book than I could have imagined. From the utterly terrible acting performances (and dont you,  Oh that was done on purpose, you just dont get it  me!) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting. I viewed it with no ill-will at the outset, and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Right down to its end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in every place that OConnors book shined and resonated. The actors portraying the  southern  policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot-dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather. The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beattys lively and dead-on representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. OConnors powerful book is most well-known for its creepy, religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of  Faith . Mr. Hustons film is a shameful mockery of the authors intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her fans, if I may be so bold as to say so. While I acknowledge that I cant know exactly what the author wished to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan. If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For Flannerys sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. The forgetting.that will take some time.#0
9235_4#This woman never stops talking throughout the movie. She memorized every line, and delivered all without a bit of natural emotion. She also has a most uncharming lisp, and the pitch of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. This film has WAY too much Betsy Drake, and not enough Cary Grant, who carried what little was left of the film entirely on his own.#0
7284_1#Wow. I read about this movie and it sounded so awful that I had to see it, and my gosh, I can smell it in St Louis. Where do I start? National Lampoons was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of Animal House, but they completely missed the mark. Ill go chronologically with these short flicks. The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr John did the film score (repeating  Going to the Movies  over and over again) and the film isnt much longer than an hour and a half. Show this one in film classes with the heading  what you should NEVER do in film-making.  This script should have been left on the shelf because yep, its that bad.#0
2362_1#The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best Horror films of all time. This is the crappiest. When I sat down to watch this, I was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were, this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones. Boy was I wrong. Incredibly wrong. So please, dont waste your time on this worthless junk.#0
4622_2#No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The timing was of the release was awful. The Gong Show had already  jumped the shark  by the time the movie came out, so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show? And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic, 90-minute whine by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as host of the show. Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed-up millionaire life? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously so, since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Did he think the gag of having everyone, everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network executive hounding him at every turn? This might have worked as the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene, and the Unknown Comic again (although, to make the movie  spicy,  they included only his most vulgar routines). And as someone else has pointed out, this is Phil Hartmans first significant movie part (even though it lasts only a minute). Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits, which is the name he was born with. You cant miss his voice and facial expressions, even though hes much thinner and younger than in the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a tiny part; one of his first after leaving the soap world.#0
3082_10#What is really sad, shows like Six Degrees and Brothers & Sisters are the true reality TV, not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows. I think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult following. But with the more vocal backlash the fans of Jericho (which I also enjoy) and other shows, networks may start to reverse this trend. I am like others, I will not support ANY new shows until they have been given a second season. Ill then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via DVDs and online viewing. Until then ABC, you have lost me as a viewer to ANY new show.#1
5793_1#It really was that bad. On a par with the (mercifully!) short-lived  Dirty Dozen  TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also on the cheap in Yugoslavia). Awful - avoid #0
7143_10# Holes  is my all-time favorite movie! So far I have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to purchasing it on DVD this upcoming September. I read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were. The director of this film did an excellent job of re-creating the book into movie form. Also, all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Props to all those involved in making this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend it for everyone to see #1
1207_10#Still love it 17 or so years after the first time I saw it, in fact I discovered that I had lost my copy of this and was very upset. Despite its non-association with the original (which as a kid I never noticed and as an adult I dont care about), this is what cartoons  should  be like. Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone. Im more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing. The music is great, and gets stuck in your head foreverI have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another.#1
11548_4#Jeez, only in the 70s Antonio Margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure-hunt. The spices of this trashy co-production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian one-off company include humorous storytelling, off-the-wall happenings and some very tame T&A. Extra campy moments are being served by Lee Van Cleefs obnoxious wig, leather-clad bible-thumping psycho gunman Yancey Hobbitt (loveably hammed up by Julian Ugarte, the man who shouldve done way more obscure European genre productions than he did), wanna-be-witty dialogue, hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events (especially every jump made by Lo Lieh). This is my truth. What is yours?#0
6484_10#I remember watching this in the 1970s - then I have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library. This is the only  10  I have given any review but I have discovered like a fine bottle of wine, it is more appreciated with a little time#1
459_10#This is the best series of its type Ive seen all year. I cant help thinking its just my luck - a series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows get never ending episodes. The theme song is a favourite, and we were disappointed to find it isnt available in any published edition. Great stuff, BBC- a triumph of sense over sex-appeal (aside from the young constable nobodys there as eye-lolly, and even if he IS, he can still act!).#1
8082_3#It was one of those late night  Its there  I saw it things. Sometimes they are great. This one was awful, but it really shouldnt have been. I have seen the same cast members be incredibly good. I have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets. All the difference is in the writing.#0
8081_4#One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become satire, is that it be somewhat plausible. I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended. But Ill leave that to the physicists who might have seen Solar Crisis. The key here is that the film was directed by that noted Hollywood purveyor of flop films, Allen Smithee. The film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a Thanksgiving carving.#0
8772_8#Director Raoul Walsh was like the Michael Bay of the 40s and years before that. And I mean that in a positive way, since Im definitely aint no Bay-hater. His movies are just simple high quality entertainment, just like the Raoul Walsh movies were in his days. 8/10#1
3169_2#This movie is one of the worst ones of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. I have never watched Desparte Housewives, so I dont know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. Its like she knows nothing about acting. All her character does is whine throughout the film, and she cant pull off being a b     and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, displays little emotion and its like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them. FINAL VERDICT Its not worth watching.#0
3080_1#Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it doesnt even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time. I remember the day I first saw this on MST. Sun was shining, looked like a good day. then, I saw this product of Rick Sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land. Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages an assistant security guard job, fights with rakes, and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images. No plot or story is needed. Obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves. An army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff, and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say,   He has got some nice red shorts . Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart. Just when you think its over, wait until the Club Scum scene. Ask for Road Rash. I advise that after viewing this film, a good month to regain senses and sanity. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.#0
12111_2#Written by a woman, and directed by another. Whoppie. Are we in for a feminist ride or what. Fasten your seat-belts, ladies, for we are about to enter a world of mean men and innocent, well-intentioned women. In this soaper Trish comes across a guy in the employment agency who behaves, looks, and dresses like a pimp(!) and gives her a job with the hope of nailing her some time later. In his office he even touches her chin the way a megalomaniacal heavy in a Bond movie would a touch a girl just after hes captured her and just before he is ready to kill her alongside with Bond. Some time later the pimp/employment guy stalks Trish in a ladies dressing-room, harasses her, and even comes close to raping her. Oh, these evil, evil men. They are ALL bad, dont you know. You cant even look for a job nowadays without getting raped, right ladies? Well, well show em! In this film there is some kind of a divorced womens club or something, headed by a Janet Leigh who speaks for all women involved in this film when she says that  men are all s  t . She moans about how terrible men are; she has been divorced five times. Now, seriously any woman who marries twenty times and then uses that statistic as an argument that men are all  bad  must have realized eventually that the explanation might lie elsewhere, or? It must occur to her that a) she is a bad judge of male character, or - much more likely - b) SHE is the one impossible to live with - her ex-husbands were probably the victims, or if they were indeed a  holes then she probably got what she deserved. (Dont the likes of Zsa-Zsa Gabor and Liz Taylor prove this point? Show me a likable woman who got married this often and Ill show you a way to reach the planet Mars using only roller-skates and a ladder.) Trish eventually meets a computer guy who restores her faith in men - but hold your horses; this guy turns out to be married, therefore proving WITHOUT a doubt that men are indeed all  bad . Were it not, of course, for a kindly old vegetable seller around the corner who loves his wife even though shes still dead - proving that all men are  bad  except for kindly old men whose penises dont work and they  cant get none  anyway so they are forced to abandon a life of a  holocolism and finally give women the respect they deserve. Even the supporting male characters are all  bad ; the black guy in the employment agency is unfriendly, and the guy in the mortuary is out-right rude - and insensitive (the bastard,  sob  sniffle ) And whats with this corny, corny ending? Minutes before court-time Trish abandons the claim to any of her husbands money, realizing that she is now  free  and that she can finally do that jump into the swimming pool?? Whats all that about?? Her jump into the pool is then - very predictably - frame-frozen as the credits start to role in, while life-inspiring I-dont-need-revenge-nor-my-husbands-money music starts kicking in. Her girlfriends are shocked by her abandonment of money claims, but they dont stay shocked for long and soon start kidding each other about what a heart-attack Trishs lawyer will get when he hears about this. The shyster lawyer is naturally a man. An evil, evil, terrible  bad  man, whose only interest in this world is money Ah, these men; all they care about is money; they know nothing of the higher values in life - like shopping. I am glad we have movies like this; they bring the sexes closer together, but most importantly, they teach girls and young women that men are all horny, selfish, skirt-chasing bastards who will dump you into a world of poverty and misery the first chance they get. So, girls, open your mouths an stick your tongues into your girlfriends mouths. Lesbian power #0
2624_7#In this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! This film even goes back to before Simba and (presumbably) just after the birth of Kiara.  For anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age, enjoy  Lion King 1/2   -)#1
764_10#Without doubt Beat Street is the best film about the breakin scene. Everything about it is spot on,the clothes (puma),the music and most importantly the dancing! The storyline is basic,but hey whats there to tell a story about? The whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doing,what mattered to them. It shows that teenagers in general are good,all that mattered to these everyday kids was music,dancing and friendship. Having watched the DVD recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time! The clothes didnt look dated (possibly because Puma is now having a massive comeback),the music still sounds fresh,and the dancing is still captivating to watch. A film anyone 10-25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture.#1
7353_1#Watching it now its still as skanky and sexist as I remember. comes from a time when girls were  Dolly Birds  and basically mens playthings. Its hard to take in that it is from the Hammer studios and the fact its available on DVD when good films are not. Our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse! Trouble is you cant help feeling nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus. Try to hold your stomach contents when you see Olive in a fluffy? Blue  saucy  nightie or something similar like Shirley Bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972. Warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus, which Ive been informed is not a Routemaster but a Bristol. Look just dont bother watch something decent instead like Porridge or Dads Armyor a fly crawling up a wall.#0
5044_1#I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, Im also Shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter. However, after watching it, I was extremely disappointed. The movies pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous. The director lingered on certain scenes for much too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was barely any dialogue. Dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the movie, you didnt feel any compassion for the characters. This movie was lacking in everything. The script was weak, the acting was poor, and the editing was non-existent. The director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably. A good movie is one in which captures your attention, maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by. This movie felt as though it would never end. Dont waste your money on this movie.#0
12224_9#i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very exciting.it was at least,not like the teen-slasher movies that pop out every now and then.the search for the killer and the partner relationship between the hero&the so-called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie.also,i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie.i mean its exciting.maybe some time later,i might watch the movie again#1
7114_4#As far as cinematography goes, this film was pretty good for the mid 50s. There were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus. The acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible. Several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non-existent. The attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings. I also couldnt help but think the budget didnt allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon. Honestlyit would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie. It wasnt bad enough to be a  good-bad  movie but wasnt good enough to be  good  either. Get the MST3K versionits more fun.#0
2260_10#A DAMN GOOD MOVIE! One that is seriously underrated. The songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain, but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg puts in a good performance here, but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character. I wish she was in more movies. This movie should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.#1
10883_7#This is surprisingly above average slasher, thats enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. All the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. I bought this at a pawn shop for a 1$, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus I loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy. The finale was really cool, as I loved how they defeated the killer, and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well, plus all the characters except for Ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable!. Its decently made and written, and I thought it was quite creative and original at times as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer didnt mess around, and I loved it, and Slasher fans(like myself) should really enjoy this film, plus The opening was really wicked too, with them filming the movie!. This is a surprisingly above average slasher, thats enjoyable,and well made, with some decent gore, and I say its well worth the watch!. The Direction is good. Kimble Rendall does a good! job here with solid camera work, using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace. The acting is solid!. Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely well,and I had troubles feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better towards the end, but not by much, Im surprised she decided to do this film, nonetheless she did an excellent job!. Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is menacing, creepy and had one hell of a mask, and this guy didnt mess around, he was fantastic!. Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall well worth the watch!.     out of 5#1
9732_3#First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If youre trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee hes going to ruin it for you. If you dont take him too seriously, then hes actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - Im just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.#0
3213_1#Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time that I experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it. The entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course. The story line was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was out the window, and the animation was done by four-year olds. Does that cover it? I have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life. I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews I am not off base with my observation. Grade   out of      #0
3564_2#Pet Sematary , though a nice 80s Horror movie, with a nice Director and atmosphere, IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati. Its clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie Zeder was made before King wrote the book) Let the world know#0
4106_7#This definitely is NOT the intellectual film with profound mission, so I really dont think there is too much not to understand to in case you arent Czech. Not bad film, not the ingenious one, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes are truly worth seeing.#1
2889_10#   Might not consider this having a spoiler, but Id rather be cautious than careless    I never saw this movie when I was little. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it with my three year old daughter. I can watch it over and over again. This is a wonderful movie, especially if you are into love stories. My daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and still gets excited at the end.#1
7259_7#How can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5.4?! Just the lovely young Alisan Porter should automatically start you at 6 when you decide your rating. James Belushi is good in this too, his first good serious role, I hadnt liked him in anything but About Last Night until this. He was pretty good in Gang Related with Tupac also. Kelly Lynch, you gotta love her. Well, I do. Im only wondering what happened to Miss Porter? i gave Curly Sue a 7#1
2710_1#Somehow they summed up the 60s, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They trivilized the major events and happenings and they  claimed  it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family. If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash. What was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways, but managed to attend every major 60s event through the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family. That poor son Please NBC, do not make any movies about any other eras.leave that to PBS and the History Channel#0
4894_2#Redundant, everlasting shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you will find in this film. In other words, it seemed technically poor to me. The musical bits are amateurishly directed (no synchronization in the would-be dancing, badly post-synchronized, bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc).  The trailer I saw was very dynamic, that is not true for the film. That is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off.#0
9084_7#Yes, some people have said that this movie was a waste of money, but im the kind of die hard dragon/world-ending/holy crap action movie fan. overall i loved the movie,but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well.#1
4160_9#One word can describe this movie and that is weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Well it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. On the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out.#1
3803_9#What people fail to understand about this movie is that it isnt a beginning, middle, and end, it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long TV series. So remember that when you all talk about how the world wasnt explored enough. That was all done in the TV show. The world is amazing, the plot is a lot better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check it out. )#1
10568_1#Wow. I have seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one truly takes the cake. Its the worst movie Ive seen in the past decade - no exaggeration. In short, this film has absolutely NO redeeming qualities at all. Its a total waste of time. Id strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by; its truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for.#0
11554_8#I dont think Ive really ever given Walter Matthau his due as a comedic performer. Hes certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles, but I guess I always put his success down to his characters grumpiness and ruthlessness, a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co-star Jack Lemmon, and, I suppose, a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures. Watching Gene Saks The Odd Couple (1968), adapted from a popular Neil Simon play, the realisation suddenly clicked Matthau is, in his own right, absolutely hilarious! Initially striking the audience as filthy, crude and generally unappealing, his Oscar Madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts, culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that Matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own. At the same time, while holding his own as a comedian, his interplay with Lemmon is, of course, pitch-perfect; indeed, the film rightly belongs to both actors, who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves, let alone together. The Odd Couple is a terrific comedy, most of all because it has a lot of heart. For all their arguing, its obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other, most movingly seen when Felix tries to launch into a furious tirade, instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing Oscar how  tops  he his. The pairs four poker buddies (John Fiedler, Herb Edelman, David Sheiner and Larry Haines) are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance, but you cant deny that theyve got the best of intentions. Their decision to treat Felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory, but maybe being ignored wasnt quite the correct solution to Felixs gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality. Unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays {I was recently disappointed by Wilders The Seven Year Itch (1955)}, this film doesnt simply strike at the same chord throughout, and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed, through tears, laughter and much disagreement.#1
2987_10#This is the weepy that Beaches never was. As much as I wanted to love Beaches, it always seemed too hurried for me to  feel  for it (its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though). Stella, on the other hand, moves at a slower (and occasionally too slow) pace and though its somewhat manipulative in its tears-inducing tale about a self-sacrificial mother, it works because Bette and the rest of the cast turn in great performances. 10/10#1
6616_1#I must tell you right up front, I am certainly NOT an authority on Bollywood films and have only seen a handful. However, if youve never seen one, DONT start with this one! I have greatly enjoyed the ones Ive seen up until this one, but I just couldnt stand this one. I also must tell you up front that I could not finish this film--it was that annoying. So why was it so annoying?  Perhaps if you are the most ardent action and Bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me I can see why its on IMDbs infamous Bottom 100 list. Wowthis film is bad AND intensely bad #0
12097_4#I wasnt really hoping for much when I went to see this. After Mst3king the heck out of JasonX with some friends though, I was hoping for a similar experience here. #0
10777_9#Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. The movie doesnt take a happy or sad approach on things, it just tells us a story, one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters, it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again, feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry at times, it will shock you and comfort you, it will give you and take from you. Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life, and that of my friends, and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours.#1
6385_10#This movie was great! It was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie with no singing. Perfect. 10 out of 10.#1
11217_3#So the wife and I just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off. For the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was just very little excitement. The acting was atrocious, to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes (the church lady for example). The dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin, although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like The Ring. Rather then get the police involved -- which Im sure those earplugs she found would have DNA all over them -- she instead devises a horrible plan to get the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister. I call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too, which the movie then fades to black. Bad dialog, bad acting, bad ending.#0
7042_1#This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. Even for a biker movie, its rock bottom. The minimal plot involves a gang of bikers taking over a small town (how original!) and the townspeoples attempts to fight them off. Why dont they call for outside help? Who knows? The fight scenes are obviously fake. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it but both have little to do and both look ashamed to be there (understandably) This movie belongs in the trash heap!#0
88_9#This was one of the best movies I have seen. The movie relates to real life and how drugs CAN play a major part. Although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget, I found it to be exhilarating to watch. I think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control. This movie might just scare them enough to change their ways.#1
3659_3#This review applies for the cut of the film thats generally available as  Fury of the Wolfman . I understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage, and I would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as  Fury of the Wolfman . In short, the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It is utter nonsense, and incomprehensible nonsense at that. Is this making any sense? No? Good. Thats the films saving grace. It doesnt try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level, it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up.  Fury of the Wolfman  may be the best Halloween party movie ever. You absolutely do not need to pay attention to it, and in fact if you do, you will be completely confused.#0
10700_8#This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does good work as well. The final is moving, and logical - movie logics, of course. Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.#1
2434_8#Ive often wondered just how much CASPER was meant for childrenwith all the issues revolving around his identity (in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, as his home is a cemetery plot), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film. Maybe Casper was meant more as a morality play, or Famous Studios felt like breaking new ground in reality cartoons. This might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children--but I wouldnt pop it into the VCR for a perky cartoon break.#1
1515_1#I watched the movie  The Flock  because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting. This was one of the WORST movies Ive seen in a long while (and Ive seen some turkeys.) Ive never posted online before but this movie was so awful I had to do so. I suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish its unbelievable. The story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite its nauseating. Poor Gere, he deserves so much better. As for the Gere/Danes on screen matchup, because of the horrible writing, one doesnt believe either character for a single minute. Ill bet Gere wishes he could buy back the negative, were such a thing possible. Its a shame to see talent wasted so badly, not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back. (I know what youre thinking. How do I really feel?)#0
9813_8#This episode introduced the Holodeck to the TNG world. The Jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them. A tired Picard decides to take a trip into the Holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins. The settings are superb and almost movie like. Alas, the Jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all its safety devices stop working. Picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s America and return to the Jarada rendezvous. Picard greets the Jarada correctly and a new day dawns between Humanity and the Jarada. This gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there#1
9538_2#When I saw the commercial for this, I was all about seeing it. Now, forgive me, but its been so long since Ive seen it that I dont recall how it went. Suffice it to say, the movie I saw bore no resemblance to the  movie  they sold me on. I was bored, annoyed, and incredibly disappointed by this movie. And if it wasnt bad enough, they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music. Not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie, eh mon? I guess if you never saw the commercial (or trailer, I suppose) you may think this is some hot stuff. For my money, the commercial was way better.#0
3308_3#When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. Its done by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you dont really find anything. Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view, theres really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all its English cosiness, its just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another  Full Monty . Why they made this film? I havent got a clue, apart from making money of course.#0
6822_7# Opening Night  released in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. It succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of theatre actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. She is self-absorbed, often obnoxious, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined, although we are let in on the secret early. Rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband, actor/director John Cassavettes, who has a role in the film as well. This film is not without flaws - it is overly long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel. The  improvising  in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - goes on way too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, playing Myrtles sleazy producer. Joan Blondells character is never fully developed, and I never could figure out why she was in the film, except to placate Myrtle. See this film for Rowlands alone - she is fascinating throughout - and it is tough to take your eyes off her, although you will want to at times.#1
8669_1#First and foremost, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. Its the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I as just hoping that this movie would be all right. It had lots of chances, with a great cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And on top of all that, it has PAM GRIER! I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel, but it makes blood boil. Dont see this movie but read the book. Its a classic of Bradbury.#0
6665_3#OK, the story - a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is mildly interesting one. Anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has some) - the execution is everything. And that scene where the loony enters the movie, oh my God, I would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. Creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying. Again, if youre a 16 years old girl somewhere in Kansas nowhere or whatever-where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age, OK, then you might enjoy this movie and its  message .#0
11730_10#What can one say about Elvira that hasnt already been said in the worlds press? The classic comedienne that IS Elvira delivers in her first full-length big budget comedy masterpiece. Why she didnt win the Best Actress Oscar for this role is beyond me.#1
12398_2#Look, its the third one, so you already know its bad. And  Maniac Cop  wasnt good enough to warrant the second installment, so you know its even worse. But how much worse? Awful, approaching God-awful. This is what youre in for.#0
944_4#Take one look at the cover of this movie, and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film. This is cheese filmmaking in every respect, but it does have its moments. Despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives, the story is actually interesting at some points, although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality-free boyfriends. The acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot, which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audiences attention. In The Nutty Professor, a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer, whereas in The Invisible Maniac, a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible, allowing him to spy on (and kill, for some reason) his students. Boring fodder. Dont expect any kind of mental stimulation from this, and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick#0
2656_1#(Very light spoilers, maybe.)  The supporting cast was sincere and well played--I felt for  them! --and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, that wasnt enough to carry the film for me.#0
10786_10#me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so (but they let us anyways) and I love itI cant find anyone that lives near me that knows what I am talking aboutIm glad to see that Im not the only one that loved this movieI wish i could find this on DVD somewhere  I would love to watch this now just bc I loved it so much as a little kidand Im 15 now  I remember so much about itthats where I got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie  I think the little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her little playground thing#1
3514_7#The premise is a bit better than the execution, but that doesnt mean the film is worth a look. Splendid supporting cast makes this a fun mystery to unravel. Raines is great as the resourceful woman determined to solve this puzzlement. I always enjoy Thomas Gomez.#1
4430_1#Thanks to a dull, dimensionless screenplay by Neil Simon, and lackluster direction from Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes a shrill showcase for Marsha Mason who received her third of four Oscar nods for Chapter Two giving the same performance here that she gave in Cinnderella Liberty(73), The Goodbye Girl(77), Audrey Rose(78) and Only When I Laugh(81);only this time she doesnt have a child to drag around. Chapter Two is the third and last feature film for Moore having previously directed Neil Simons The Cheap Detective(78) and Murder By Death(76). Caan is miscast, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialog is overly analytical, and theres virtually no establishing detail. The first half is a less-than-captivating, meet cute, coy romance between a blinkered Caan and a chipper Mason, and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half. The NYC locations as well as Joe Bologna, and a painfully thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some welcome distraction. And last and least, theres an awful song played during the credits.#0
7993_4#This is another one of those humans vs insects/eco-horror features; a theme that was popular in the late 70s. Only you cant really call it horror. Theres zero suspense and no gruesome events. In other words this movie is pretty lame. Its not that its really bad or something; its just very boring. A construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants. Later on we learn that, probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past, their bite became poisonous. Some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out whats going on. Robert Foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours. Then they flee in the house, waiting to get rescued. And, man, you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them. I wont spoil too much, but at one point they even use a big helicopter. All the time when I was watching this, I sat there thinking  Come on, people, you all got shoes on. Just run out of the building. Im sure a bunch of ants wont catch up with you.  Its all pretty ridiculous. One small surprise came near the end. No, it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot. It was just that Brian Dennehy made an appearance as a chief-fireman. Ehrr What more can I say? This movie is called IT HAPPENED AT LAKEWOOD MANOR but the box-art of my copy read ANTS and the title during the opening credits was PANIC AT LAKEWOOD MANOR. There you have it. Now, since this is a made-for-TV movie from the 70s, Ill be once again extremely mild in my final rating. Now, THE SAVAGE BEES, another humans vs insects TV-movie from 1976 was much better than this one. I even feel I have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ANTS. Lacking suspense, action, thrills, shocks and creepiness, the only thing youll be left with after seeing ANTS is an annoying itch.#0
7035_8#Cusack does his best David Niven in this one, although I dont know if anyone besides me noticed it. I never knew how soothing Montels voice was until this movie I think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs!#1
11682_7#Theres a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist, actually exist right now. Its a bit too much to wrap your head around, but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place. For Barbara Jean Trenton (Ida Lupino), that time was twenty five years earlier, the mid 1930s when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise. For my part, if I could travel through time, it would be back to the 1950s when I grew up. Maybe to a place like Willoughby, but thats another episode. Fortunately for us viewers, Ida Lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were not big, but a nice showcase. Its a real treat to watch any episode of  The Twilight Zone  and get to see who pops up from days gone by. Sometimes you get a two-fer, like you have here with Lupino and Balsam, celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began, and sometimes after. Combined with the stories that the program produced, its not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today.#1
5057_10#amazing movie I saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that I had not even heard of it before getting on that plane. while it may seem, at first to be a  chick flick , it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy. Men, watch this movie with someone you love. You will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points.#1
3364_1#So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, the people laugh, joke etc. This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, a girl sees s ghost. Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc. This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does but, oh no, she dies as she does. And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says  oh no . The acting is wooden, the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it, but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this. A very big let down. My sister (who gets sacred very easily) got bored in this film it is appalling.#0
2524_10#I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as well done as they were, nor did I expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and Ill be on the lookout for the next movie like it. I especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it wasnt a cheesy vampire flick, nor did it over embellish that fact. The characters all had human traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives. I give this movie two thumbs so far up. Definitely the best movie I have seen in the past five years.#1
2561_3#666 The Child starts as a plane crashes, the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named Donald (Boo Boo Stewart) who is adopted by news reporter Erika (Sarah Lieving) & her cameraman husband Scott Lawson (Adam Vincent) after they covered the incident for Channel 6 news. At first Donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around, after warnings from a Nun & Vicar Scott begins to believe that Donald is evil & the cause of all the deaths 666 The Child is a poor mans The Omen rip-off, Id sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week. Not good & definitely not recommended. Followed by the sequel 666 The Beast (2007) which also went straight-to-DVD.#0
10976_1#A terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one. It needed some dependence on something. Then, we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes awry but there doesnt seem to be any punishment for the crooks. Perhaps, the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film.#0
1738_7#This is a hilarious film. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beattys Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it, such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yeah!) is assigned by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract. This is a funny film in which Burt proves that he aint too proud. I like it!#1
2591_7#Offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are both not only so-called  fire starters  (think Stephen Kings snore-fest of a book with the same name), but also forever at odds with each other over a woman who has a rather nasty habit of being a pyromaniac! Good special effects (especially towards the end), quirky performances from a pretty talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and oddly appropriate soundtrack ultimately make  Wilder Napalm  a unique treat of a film to watchif you can find it that is! On a personal note, I was fortunate enough to snatch it up (so to speak) from the two-dollar bin at my local video-rental store. (    out of      )#1
4244_10#This film has slipped through the cracks of film history. It is by far much better than some other New York films of the same era such as  The French Connection  or  The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 . There is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line. Its engaging from start to finish and hasnt tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examples. Unfortunately this film has not been made available on either DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really has a gem on their hands and its a shame theyre not doing anything with it.#1
3935_9#The basic hook here is Lincoln Is Slow. It is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation, making him a Great Leader who is here engaged in single-handedly civilizing the American frontier through the grand instrument of Law. All that John Ford hooey and more, including one lurking slave and extraneous Death By Injun. However! The slow conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie-making, funny and moving at extremes. The history may be bunk, but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true-seeming moments. Check out Henry Fondas big introductory stroll across the deck, his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river, his dalliance with Mary Todd on the porch, and the priceless business that follows Maam, weve got to hurry  Things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama; but Fonda is priceless throughout.#1
11527_1# The movie starts out as an ordinary comic-hero-movie. It s about the boy who is picked on, has no parents and is madly in love with the schools 1 girl. Nothing surprises in the movie, there is nothing that you can t guess coming in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one. Maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest. You can t get away from thinking of movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All of those titles are better. I almost walked out the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation, BUT not even that is anything to put in the christmas-tree! So my recomendation Don t see this film even if you get paid for it!#0
1362_4#Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all. Ms. Smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb-red head, but by films end, she is the brains of the outfit. Too bad the writing didnt go the way with her.#0
8194_9#Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the countrys socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early 80s. Its also a kickass action movie. Opening with a liberal, female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene which prompts the famous,  Go ahead, make my day  line),  Sudden Impact  is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film. The first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome Inspector Callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. It gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for Callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the 80s.#1
3125_1#Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend,  Dont try to doctor me, doctor! Im disgustingly healthy!  He invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by  shrinking the brain  (?) This senseless mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips.#0
5993_8#The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the films lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time. The ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. I was especially enjoyed the thrill of the films suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot. The tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do. Worth watching more than once!#1
2529_7# The Invisible Ray  is part science fiction and part horror. It was also the third of seven Karloff/Lugosi features. In this entry the dominant role goes to Boris Karloff. At 79 minutes this film was the second longest of the six Karloff/Lugosi collaborations. Karloffs film all the way.#1
1346_9#As a  rebuttle  of sorts to the AFIs top 100 films, the British Film Institute worked out a documentary with Martin Scorsese. Now. I am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many, many films. But, I am nowheres in comparrison with my idol. In this fantastic (though long) documentary, Scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of the American History on film. This is divided in to several sections including the Western, the Gangster film and the Noir. Full of bouncy enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor.#1
1639_10#Fabulous actors, beautiful scenery, stark reality. I wont elaborate on all of the other reviewers comments because you get the picture! However, the movie isnt for the squeamish. Reality is slaughtering pigs and other livestock in order to survive. I also have Elinore Randall Stewarts homestead book. I read it several years ago, I have to reread it, since I just watched the newly-released, remastered DVD of the movie. I tried to buy the video for several years, finally bought it used from a video store that went out of business. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I purchased it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but well worth it to me. This is a movie I will be watching until the end of my days!#1
6212_9#I have a deep liking for this film despite it appearing deliberately less polished than the other Fred and Ginger films, not to mention the slightly problematic casting of Harriet Hillard in the lead romantic role.  Overall, I actually prefer this to Top Hat and Swing Time (although only just), as it is more earthy and performed so enthusiastically by all involved, it is hard to dislike the fun factor.#1
718_2#The main reason people still care about  Carlton-Browne Of The F.O.  is that it features Peter Sellers in a second-billed role. But watching this film to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. The film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one, and a final bit of action by Carlton-Browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally. Apparently he lives to see another day, but the film of the same name is strictly DOA.#0
4988_7#Mans Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called Hoovervilles named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in his administration. The proposition of this film is that a mans home is still his castle even when its just a shack in a Hooverville. Mans Castle is grim look at the Great Depression, not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.#1
4543_7#Well no, I tell a lie, this is in fact not the best movie of all time, but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody I know has seen. Im giving this 7. to be honest I like it more than that. Id rather watch this than a lot of stuff Id give 8. But I guess I know deep down that its some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie.#1
12083_3#Yay! I think. Its hard to say. Its hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion. This movie is as sterile as a surgeons scalpel. For a setting, it has a few stone pillars, some stone seats, a couple stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature. The dubbing really wasnt all that bad though. The voices stuck true to the dull, gloomy, dreary, life-sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth. I have seen this version of Hamlet on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times, I was on the brink of turning off the TV, despite it being MST 3K. Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.#0
10147_1#I usually dont comment anything (i read the others opinions) but this, this one I _have_ to comment I was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action, F-117 and other hi-tech stuff, but by only few first minutes and I changed my mind Lousy acting, lousy script and a big science fiction. And one more thing, before any movie I usually check user comments and rating on this site 3.7 points and I give this movie a try, now Im wondering WHO rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ??????????#0

1343_9#Thre isnt a single Scorsese movie Id place on a list of my favorite movies. But this is the best thing Ive run through my DVD player in about five years. Scorseses patient elucidation of favorite film moments, and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent.  On a negative note, Scorsese is best when hes excited to show you some obscure movie, rather than when hes didactically teaching you something well-established about film history. And I do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose. Its very distracting.#1
11137_1#All the bare chested women in the world couldnt keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish. With the derisory acting, equally terrible script plus the poor CGI FX to match; this movie is an insult to the Werewolf genre. It is supposed to be serious, which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke. 0 out of 10!#0
7307_2#This is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. The events in it are completely random and make little or no sense. The fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever (IM SO SORRY). I describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together. e.g Kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own, then theres the cop who is slightly weird and perverted, then the drug addict, then theres the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help. then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down. then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on Kevin the karate kid. Its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love Eli Roth, even that did not make me like this film. Hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 #0
1267_1#Why me? Why should I be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot?! At least if I can warn other people off, it will have been worthwhile. If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Note, though, that this movie does not DEPICT what we have come to think of as an  LA lifestyle , it is a wonderful example of the products that ARISE from it.#0

11149_10#Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides hes going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City. The women are there for the asking and the men are mainly  tutti-fruttis.  Wide-eyed, he comes to New York City, not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences, one worse than the other. In the middle of that chaos, he meets and befriends Rico  Ratso  Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building. A dark story of dashed hopes, John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s, and at the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life. There is the implied notion that they may have been lovers -- Ratsos reaching out to hug Joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this -- but this is essentially a buddy film, one that manages to survive, literally, to the death, and bring some form of hope to Joe who at the end in Florida seems much changed, older, wiser.#1
10869_1#A friend of mine lent this video to me and I was fairly excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of James Hetfields slow pitched vocals and Lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion I began to think, `Why am I watching this? That question will be coursing through your minds in 5  10 minutes after you hit Play. I gave the tape back the same day, as you would suspect, not worth buying or watching! #0
6737_2#If Deborah Messing were not already cast as  Grace , this might be a tolerable film. However, it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues, who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) she reads about in a Time magazine article to travel to London for her sisters London wedding. How new is this plot? Lots of drunken female bonding, cricket visual jokes, and Mulroney in a towel (nice!), but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending. Expected Messing sequel Divorce Date.#0
6001_2#This may sound crazy to even the people who remember this showBut I remembered this as being live-action. I dont think I ever saw the cartoon. but movie? maybe. I remember it very clearly. The guy was in a building kinda like a showroom. He even had the red jacket. It was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him. The car/guy spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street. And then proceeded to drive off. That is all I remember. I really hope someone else out there remembers this too. If not, Maybe Im still crazy. But Im hoping Im not.#0
2554_7#The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would be a pretty good replacement duo.#1
6389_2#I waited almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking it might be an underrated work, from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been. It starred one of the best film villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of childrens books, and was a Disney Studios production. What could possibly be wrong with it? As it turns outs, almost everything. The extra star that keeps this from being  awful  goes to Price and Mancini.#0
3024_9#A film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war, when a Spanish Republican, sent by his soon to be overthrown government, (Charles Boyer) infiltrates himself into England looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in Spain. He upsets the locals, getting convincingly beaten in one scene, and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood. Notwithstanding socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia, and world politics, this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre, and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by James Wong Howe, and manages more than once to get under your skin.#1
4973_9#I remember watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old and REALLY enjoying this. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since then, as it was aired on  Walt Disney Presents  on the Disney Channel. Id forgotten most of it, and some of it was geared towards kids, but it was still enjoyable. I cant wait to show it to my niece and nephews.#1
10495_7#Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon,when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun. I mean,the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness! It was the first movie I watched with this theme(drugs/marijuana) that is not really criticizing it,only making jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow,who lives in a small town in U.K. and has many financial problems because of her dead husband, who committed suicide since he was full of debts. The problem is that Grace, who imagined to have some money saved for her, discovers that she needs to pay all of her husbands pounds in debts to not lose all of her things, specially her house that she loves so much. She never worked before, and is in a tragic situation until Matthew,her gardener who is very found of smoking pot, decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale.#1
7478_10#Im from Romania ill try to speak in English. All i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one. Seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now. It has all the little things i like in a movie , its very touching makes me cry . Shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people. It so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , hes inner being, and this i see in this movie. Perhaps for me its much more than a motion picture , its a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate. Its a long way from reality to sci-fi , but .. what if. What if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down , would fall? We would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that , on your death bed , the bigger thing you remember , is not the wealth , not the adventure , not the countries you visited and the people that remember you. But the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die , all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more. WATCH THIS MOVIE and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me ) Hail from Romania#1
981_2#As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) watch this very, very dull picture. It is Miss Dietrichs first color film, and the worlds most beautiful blond is a redhead! Bad start. The story is a tremendous bore, involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff religious guilt. (Who needs it???) Suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all Dietrichs films (and I have seen most, including  Pittsburgh ) this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching. The color photography is OK (this is a very early Technicolor release), but to no purpose. Ridiculous casting C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough said?). The only thing of any interest at all is John Carradines outlandish caricature of a performance as  The Sand Diviner,  who foretells all that will happen. The supposed  happy ending  is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Yet another example of David O. Selznicks highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good film? -- other than That One?) And, for one final annoyance, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess, with volume levels seemingly randomized. Highly unrecommended.#0
7863_4#THHE2 is entertaining in that youll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say  oh sh t!  and  get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumb  s  or things along those lines but I dont know if its really worth seeing- I was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who dont seem to know the first thing about combat. So go for some laughs, or go for some gore, but dont go hoping to come out of it satisfied.#0
4971_7#This is an absurdist dark comedy from Belgium. Shot perfectly in crisp black and white, Benoît Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) is on fine form as Roger, the angry, obsessive father of a family in a small, sullen Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, along with his young daughter Luise, visits road accidents to take photos. He is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record - and he decides that his son, Michel, must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him. Michel dresses as Elvis and has a spot on a radio show called Cinema Lies, where he describes mistakes in films. Luise is friendly with near neighbour Felix, a pigeon fancier. Roger is a callous figure as he pushes Michel right over the limit during the record attempt, which almost results in his death. Interspersed throughout the film are Magritte-like surreal images. Its undeniably charming and well worth your time.#1

2273_4#This wasnt the major disaster that I was expecting, but that is about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. Im not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie, but I suppose its all a matter of taste. Personally, I dont find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television, but then again, Im not a fan of Jerry Springers pathetic daytime talk show. I didnt get too bored watching this, but I was definitely never enjoying it, either. If youre in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that isnt too painful to sit through, this is a good choice.#0
5274_3#If you like movies about creepy towns, hotels, houses, states (ala the Eagles  Hotel California ), etc. that possess the people that are  just passing through,  read almost any Stephen King novel instead. If you like the setting of  Disappearance  start by reading Kings  Desperation  but also check out  The Shining ,  Salems Lot  and  Needful Things.  Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years, but theyre still TV and direct-to-DVD caliber actors.#0
8069_1#An incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track,  Soul Survivors  is the latest entry in the  whos dead and whos alive  genre of horror films. Two teenaged couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, prepare to go off to different colleges, but before they part until Thanksgiving Break, they attend one last fling at a rave-type party in some burnt-out church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty Annabel (Eliza Dushku, a.k.a. Faith, the other vampire slayer). Motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and before long, the quartet leave the party. Driving away in their SUV, they are pursued and then passed by the motiveless creepy guys, who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway, causing a nasty and fatal accident as the SUV flips over an embankment and plunges into a river. Sean is killed (or is he?), and Cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt (she was driving) when shes not being haunted by Seans ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guys. Much unexplained incoherence follows as Cassies mental state degenerates further, until we reach the predictable conclusion. So, who is dead and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who actually cares?#0

4920_7#No, not really, but this is a very good film indeed, and is sadly a forgotten gem. Black and white suits the film. Very well directed, and the acting is great. Richard Widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by Paul Douglas as the police captain, and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as the baddies. Sadly Palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies.#1
5079_8#Well, would firstly like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is a part of a Tamil prayer and roughly translated it means  to protect . Khakhee on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). Now Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELLENT movie with a great soundtrack. Certainly very stunning in the final scene, especially love the ending (which is certainly unexpected!). The gore is rather too much at times, but certainly this is a great movie #1
6877_1#I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and I ended up watching one about Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I fail to see the 50% that live in poverty. When I do see struggling people, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans, or Cubans that have recently arrived to the island. There is no such thing as spanglish either you speak Spanish, or you dont. and from what I heard you dont. Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK to me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1%. To the rest he as loco as Osama Bin Laden. Puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all of South and Central America, and Mexico. Its worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Nuyoricans and their struggles. Bocabonita  doc.  was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if its how we all feel. Should have been titled  yo soy nuyorican lunchecant speak Spanish.  PLEASE STOP USING PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, OR ANYTHING ELSE ASSOCIATED WITH PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN HISTORICAL LESSON. God forbid they play this on the island.#0
5201_10#The Human Tornado is a campy 70s Blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedian Rudy Ray Moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date. The movie tells the tale of Dolemite, a bad ass pimpin hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife. Dolemite barely escapes, and journeys to sunny California to visit an old friend, a nightclub owner (and Madam to Dolemites ladies) named Queen Bee. However, it seems that a rival nightclub owner with Mob connections is trying to muscle in on her racket, so Dolemite takes matters into his own hands. Rudy Ray Moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film, including strong dramatic skills, a mastery of Kung Fu, an impressive singing voice (he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack), a touching, compassionate side with the ladies, and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing. This film has it all, people A deep plot, blistering action, laugh-a-minute comedy, beautiful women in distress, a slam-bang endingwhat more could you ask from a movie? Run, dont walk, to your local video store and rent The Human Tornado today. And be sure to share it with your family.#1

I thought this movie was good. I gave it a 8/10. Thats how good it is. Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even is shes been in only six.#1
403_3#Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle its difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild) in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, Bacon isnt nearly hateful enough to compel. The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves. The climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.#0
11884_4#The worlds largest inside joke. The worlds largest, most exclusive inside joke.

3431_10#Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen, although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries. But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance. (And many of them still doat least on some level)  There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does that. Unfortenately Järvi-Laturis other films are far from this kind of achievements. His first one, Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest, History is Made at Night was just a weird mess.#1

Shut up! . Mr Jefferson was so brave, wasnt he? Dying to save the others. I felt really sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared. I was like  Oh my god if I was Rose Id be so scared for him . And when she hugged him I was like  grrrrrr, hes mine! hands off!  but I thought that was really sweet.

1786_7#So many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so I duly responded. Here are some remarks.. Overall, the film is a classy production, but a seen-it-all-before, cried-at-it-all-before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that I expected from a tearjerker. However, it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time, about ones expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not. Worth trying at least on DVD if not at the movies#1

8739_1#The best thing about this movie was, uh, well, I cant think of anything. This was bad. The script was especially bad. The technical concepts were bad. The  suspenseful  plot was bad. The dialog was bad. Avoid at all costs. Do not rent. Do not watch. Youll be sorry.#0
8869_2#With the releasing of  Farligt förflutet  Swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day an old friend of Stefan s arrives with a favor to ask him. Stefan is to do a small courier job. He is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the Sweden-Germany customs. Unfortunately things in Germany don t work out as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family-drama pattern. Unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written, filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs. The only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex-scene wit the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. This lasts for only a few seconds leaving approxamitly 90 minutes of pure, let s say what it truly is, crap.#0
8880_3#This movie was o.k. but it could have been much better. There are some spooky moments but there arent enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again. There are some scenes you could fast forward through & not miss anything. The biggest flaw is that it is so predictable, & that is the reason why I rated it so low. Its watchable but dont expect anything great.#0
1720_2#A handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation, but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth. No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses, who suddenly become the lead characters; but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness - thats no fun!#0
1500_3#Oh, this is so bad, it is funny. The only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun. I mean you get to see porn actresses topless, having sex, then killed by human mutants. There is plenty of gore, including the classic  something is wrong with her, oh no, its half the person she used to be  and the accidental murder caused by panic. But you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someones ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees (that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward, like in cartoons). Somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn, they really need to know whats inside an actress, mere genitals are not enough. Therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos. There is NO dialog. Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when accepting a role here. I think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff, just to be reminded of the old school C class horror movies.#0
7750_8#Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows as he would sing a dEUS song. Anarchy rules over a logical and common strain of thoughts. The story behind this movie just goes any which way the wind blows. And that can truly be refreshing to watch, if you are prepared and willing that is. Viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the story-lines together are right. Who the hell is that Windman anyway? Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, bustling, happening place and Any Way captures that feeling. It also captures the silliness, the racism, the bureaucracy, the addictions and the violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city. The movie is entertaining, funny and a little shallow. Barmans screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut. In that light some might be disappointed. But then again, Worst Case Scenario would be a subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows.#1
7960_4#I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid. I snuck downstairs really early one morning, started watching HBO, and The Raft (segment 2) terrorized me good. This time around, I still enjoyed The Raft, although I couldnt tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short. The other two segments were complete trash. I cant believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk. All Ive accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of tainted childhood classics. 4/10#0
4391_8#Youre waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. I rated the Audie Murphy movie a 3 (Im a harsh grader), the second lowest I ever gave Audie (the worst being  Battle at Bloody Beach  if youre curious). I give this movie a rating of  8  (and Im a harsh grader) Its the Civil War story of renegade  soldiers , if you want to call them that, against the North. People like Quantrell, and the men who rode with these outlaws. Recommended. Complete success.#1
634_2#Well Im probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site, but The Good Earth is one of the worst structured films Ive seen in a long time. We have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one. The first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine. They have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind. Conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended. Yeah OK. With this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again.  The Good Earth is one epic waste of time. If you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get The Grapes of Wrath, a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets. Mainly because it wasnt written by a monkey.#0
12053_3#as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. TV told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, and claimed we all made over $100 a day when $20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work, and offered me work, i actually went and took the work if i was physically able.and if i would been offered the $100,000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years, and kept most in the bank and still left myself $10-20000 for NL $1-2 and $2-5 cash games at the casinos. i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll. instead i win about $1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all. i was only homeless cause i didnt wanna risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes i had over $1000-2000 in my sock while i slept outside. anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit i was different than most homeless people though, due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs. im no longer homeless, am now in govt housing for $177 a month and getting SSI and spend most of my time winning at online poker. mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me SSI. glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping, worrying about getting caught by security are finally over. had this TV crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner. its a shame how they dont better select who they pick.#0
1197_10#I just watched this movie, by mistake. What a little gem. This film made in 1956 looks, and feels, like a late Seventies movie. And is in fact better, more restrained and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. The environmental, anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time. The understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic. Much more than Dances with Wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo  killing fields  of the late 1800s. Probably because those in the movie were real killing fields. The movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls, so the animals you see are really being shot, the bones are real. In conclusion, a very under-rated western masterpiece, superbly acted, directed and shot.#1
3758_9#This movie is awesome. If you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; however, its quantity of  dudes  and  right ons  brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago. I like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness, and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor,  Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure  (1989). If you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes, and totally mature humor, dont watch it; however, if you want a film that is humorous and silly, yet intelligent and engaging, you will enjoy it. I actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in todays theatres. And hey, its Keanu Reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as actingrightdoesnt get much better than that )#1
4250_3#Its like what other Dracula movies always do, the minions of Dracula always on Draculas side, which is what disappointed me at the ending. Regardless the person wants to stay a vampire or not, I would like to see something like in the first movie that the minion fights against her master. It is much interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than just either the priest or D. win the game (we need some surprising plots!).#0
153_1# Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. But sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? Nobody should love that.  - Lucius Shepard 3/10 - A failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, incongruous comic business, emphatic music cues, and wildly hyped emotionality, all contribute to rendering  The Color Purple  worthless.#0
9038_1#This is a terrible production of Bartleby, though not, as the other reviewer put it because it is  unfilmable,  but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book. It tells the story, almost painfully so. Watching it, I could turn the pages in my book and follow along, which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation. Rather, see the 2001 version of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover. That version, while humorous, brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel. Whats important is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like setting, character names, and costumes. The difference between these film versions is like night and day, tedious and hilarious. This version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly, painful, mind-numbing schlock.#0
202_10#A Give this Movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time-Walter Matthau & George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director Herbert Ross, and all of that makes this stage adaption come true. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70s. I love the type of humor in this film, it just makes me laugh so hard. Its very funny how that happens. Two people work together as entertainers/actors/performers. They get along well on stage, but really argue off stage, they cant survive another minute with each other, then some 15 years later, you want to reunite them for a TV special. You can find that in this film. Matthau & Burns were terrific in this film. Its a damn shame they died. George Burns deserved that Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 when this movie was filmed. So far, hes the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor. He deserved that Golden Globe. Although many people might disagree with what I am about to say, everybody in this film gave a strong performance. This Comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing Whoever hates this film is a  Putz  #1
8421_10#Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General to the Czar of Russia who has found himself there. Emil Jannings won a well-deserved Oscar, in part, for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a Russian general. The movie flashes back to his days in Russia leading up to the countrys fall to revolutionaries. William Powell makes his big screen debut as the Hollywood director who casts Jannings in his film. The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg delivers yet another classic, and one that is filled with the great elements of romance, intrigue, and tragedy.#1
4272_10#this is what i call a great movie. it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story. there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, like live is.the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country (jugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrad. the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way, connect the people and the pigs that travel together.  and another reason for its magic  it is hard to get #1

2764_10#On the eighth day God created Georges. But the same as an eighth day doesnt fit into the week, Georges doesnt fit into the modern world He has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, shunted off to an asylum after his mothers death four years ago. She was the only one who loved him. The movie describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism which devours positive values such as human warmheartedness or friendship. It is Georges, the mongol, who seems to be capable of showing the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately his plea comes to a bad end. However, his failure does not necessarily have to mean that it is impossible or not desirable to reach the aspired goal. The way he shows us is surely passable, although it requires a huge amount of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply a radical nonconformism.#1
8161_10#When I saw the Dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like gory scenes as the Dentist has lots of gory scenes. Thats why it has its R18 rating. Its about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the poolman. Its best to go to your dentist  before  you watch this. But if you dont like going to the dentist already, then its best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life. the Dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that Ive ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler) pull out all his cheating wifes teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic? Overall awesome flick, but not for everyone.#1
3737_9#First off, this movie was a wild ride the whole way. The story of the training of the soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and in the end grouping together. In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrels better movies (if not his top performance). The acting for every character was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r#1
4217_9#It is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book. In this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure. To see the smug grin wiped off the face of Abigail Mitchell when she realises her victim has left  deathbed testimony  which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying. Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abbys final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect not to do his job well. Here is one situation you cant squirm out of Ms Mitchell #1
7649_4#Joyce Reynolds seems a might grown-up for the role of Janie, a boy-crazy sixteen-year old in small town America who ditches her steady guy for a visiting soldier AND winds up on the cover of Life magazine (smooching at a blanket party) all in the same week! Non-stop barrage of wisecracks, put-downs, bull talk, and unfunny bits of business such as Janies little sister bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as the maid) constantly scuttling after sassy kid sis, Janies mother involved with the Red Cross, and Janies father trying to write an editorial on the problems with todays teenagers (as the parents, stuffy, sexless Edward Arnold and pert, chatty Ann Harding make an unlikely couple, even for 1944; he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less raising two of them). Nominated for an Academy Award (!) for Owen Marks editing, Warner Bros. followed this in 1946 with  Janie Gets Married . Reynolds must have outgrown her co-horts by then--she was replaced by Joan Leslie.  1/2 from     #0
2225_4#Honestly I cant understand why this movie rates so well here, nor why Bakshi himself thought it was his finest film. Im a huge fan of Bakshis earlier work - particularly Heavy Traffic and Wizards, but frankly Wizards (1977) was the last good film he made. After that he turned to the mainstream, beginning with the diabolical Lord of the Rings and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight Frank Frazetta, for Fire and Ice. 4.5 out of 10#0
5434_1#Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few gripes. - The screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book. - Plot has been grotesquely altered. - Voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages (which may read well but are not the same when spoken, especially with Chabons writing style). - The acting is more wooden than a log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - This is supposed to be set in 1983??? Feels more like 2003  No stars.#0
10954_10#Sarah Silverman is like a totally manic Zooey Deschanel and I think Im in love already. Yeah, if you loved Jesus is Magic, youll love this. If you didnt, what the heck is wrong with you? Kudos to the Comedy Channel for shoving this in my face. My life finally has meaning, and  Your car smells like farts  is my kind of humor. Im a happy guy. The first episode had me laughing hysterically and Im hungrily looking forward to next week. This is like Grease meets South Park. Completely outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book. Her delivery is precise and oh so funny. She never skips a beat. Come to think of it, its not so much her choice of material. which is some really good stuff by the way, as it is the way she chooses to deliver it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thank you, Comedy Channel #1
4535_7#The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyles life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally got a look inside Doyle head, how he created Holmes and why he had to kill Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the role model for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice. If the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece.#1
855_1#Not the best of the films to be watched nowadays. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and was expecting it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and environment was good, but there was no story here. Not was there a single moment of fright. I expected it to a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror no thriller. The only scene where I got scared was during the chapter change scene showing  Wednesday . There are lots of fragments i the movie. Most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown. Might be a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.#0
8435_10#Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that werent exactly true to character, this was Classic HLOTS. The characters, outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were true to form, and the reunion scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen.    I call myself a  Homicidal Maniac  if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood.   #1
8908_4#This series was CBS networks answer to the success of the Big Valley. It was a 90 minute Western just like the ABC program was. While it was an answer, it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2. This is a show that I would not want DVDs of, & frankly hope they are never released. Think since CBS was running out of lots, they re-used many familiar settings. This was one the last western series CBS produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970s.#0

12162_8#The most bizarre of the cinematic sub-genres is the so called  The Great Ladies of the Grand Guignol  camp horror films which combined over-the-top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies. This genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday. 8 out of 10.#1
8960_2#the only thing that frequently pops into my head while im writing this review is,ill never get that hour and a half back  to indicate that im not just blowing air, ill compare the movie to the other movies of the cube trilogy(cube and hypercube)!cube wasnt great but it was original and that made up for some technical flaws!hypercube as a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out looking pretty sharp and i even liked it beter than cube(the story was better)! but cube zero in comparison to its predecessors really isnt worth sh t!a complete lack of good fx, a very f ck d up script and just plain old bad acting dont combine well! exampleall of the time during the movie i was thinking it would be incredibly stupid if  should happen and then it would happen, so its not very original neither! my advice dont lose that hour and a half i lost  oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns #0
7786_8#This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulees Gold). Nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Rubys day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage. #1
1597_8#This is the kind of film for a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm-chair and mellow for a couple of hours. Wonderful performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently row the plot along. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty paddle through New York life at its best. A family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.#1

For anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show. And, Michael is on my list now. Kidding I am so happy to see there is a Season 3, because I was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending. I cant wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of LostI enjoy watching TV again. Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television, but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!#1
3311_4#Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes award. Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of silliness will ensue. However, the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny. It is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998s Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation. The casting of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Graces romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all. And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing? Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants.#0

6745_4#This is a low-budget  Scream  style movie.  Maddy  is a new worker at a conspicuously-unnamed office, where she meets and starts a relationship with her co-worker  Chris . During a hot tub-party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy they belong to a  Murder Club  where everyone has killed someone for kicks. When Maddy loses it and kills someone for real, hijinks ensue. The film looks good, and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast), but, after the credits roll, youll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it.#0
2954_10#This film, though, critically acclaimed, has of course not yet been released in the U.S. on DVD, like another great - Christine Lahtis  Housekeeping , out the same year. But if you can support Region 4 (Australian) DVDs, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the internet as well.Davis is complemented by a great story, as well as memorable performances from her supporting cast, especially Claudia Carvan and the late, great Jan Adele. Amazingly, or maybe not, this film and its stars went unacknowledged at Academy Awards time, as did  Housekeeping , but treat yourself to both of them - you will be glad you did #1

10735_4#Perhaps being a former Moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the arthouse/festival crap trashcan. Its not the greatest film of 2005, nor is it complete garbage. It just has a lot of problems. I also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ideological fears, or conservative taboos or any other reason this movie might conversely be called courageous and uncompromising abroad. It was banned because the censors knew 99% of the Russian film-goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film. If you want to watch an enjoyable movie where Russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time (the entire film), watch Particulars of the National Hunt. Much more rewarding post-Soviet stuff. So yeah, a 4 out of 10 for 4, nice and symbolic of my post-mediocre-film condition.#0
7313_10#Some spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films. Often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not THE scariest. Whats great about this movie is that it doesnt rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. It is just pure terror. Its too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one, because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come.#1
7039_7#War Inc. is a funny but strange film. The actors are likable, the film is likable also, but I dont know how to describe the plot. I will go into the plot later on.

8423_4#Forest Whitakers performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck.  Historical fiction  does not justify changing history. The absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by James McAvoy. To create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable, regrettable that white people cant just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to, but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role. Making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible, lazy and stupid. Not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal, and has opened the door for movies like the one theyre planning to make with Leonardo DiCaprio as a heroic Enron whistleblower who NEVER EXISTED. The logic of the world does not apply in this film where some Scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator. It doesnt apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy. For that matter EVERYBODY is lined up to sleep with this scrawny, irresponsible, arrogant white boy, he even has Gillian Anderson licking her comely chops. Gillian Anderson looks incredible and sounds more British than most Brits. Whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance, and highlighted, with his incomprehensible pre-Oscar speeches, just how much he was acting. Its a shame the film around him had no reason to exist.#0
7827_10#This film is, quite simply, brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on TV some years later, I recognised him from Klines portrayal. Denzel Washington also turns in a masterful performance, as ever. I urge you to watch this. It is long, but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, folks, this really happened.#1
5974_1#Let me start off by saying that this doesnt seem or feel like a movie. It seems like just another TV show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up. Lately it seems that young directors are compromising the Art of film making for sales. This is very scary. The industry is spoiling the art in movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks.#0
10019_8#When it comes to movies I can be pretty picky, and Ill complain about anything and everything that is done wrong. While every movie has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count. In short, go see this movie. Dont listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if theyre so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben#1
9128_9#I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. Purple Rain not only broke boundaries, it set a decade, the costumes, the music, the behavior, and the dancing! To this day, my friends and I still jam to the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend to be Prince and the Revolution. 9/10#1
3985_8#Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance. The blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey, as I tuned in theres the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent. The ending is weak. If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever shes done, shes a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of sympathy jarring. For a film so full of emotion (and be warned its like opening champagne, youll never get the lid back on) the ending is a cold contradiction.#1
6669_1#I saw this film in my cinema class. I am glad that I did not pay to see it. I came into it with an open mind, and was even a little excited. I really enjoy Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I just never connected with this movie. The acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the storyline, or rather, lack thereof, was a problem. There was no central, connecting theme to the movie. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a western? Kind of, but no. Im all for twists in movies, I recently saw  Brick  and loved it, but the place that this movie went was just too out there. It was so weird, and if I werent required to have sat through the whole film, I would have walked out. The writing wasnt terrible, but it was just all over the place. By the time this movie ended, I was just left terribly confused and wishing that it had ended sooner. There was just something about this film that didnt resonate, I understand more offbeat films like  Fight Club , but I just did not care about the characters at all.#0
4009_3#Man, I really find it hard to believe that the wonderful Alan Ball had anything to do with this mess. Having seen the first two episodes thus far, I think I can safely say this show isnt going to be on my must see list. Its just got so many things working against it. About the only nice thing I can really think to say about this mess is that I liked the opening title sequence. HBO has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately, I hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air.#0
8147_4#This movie was a confusing piece of garbage. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unsympathetic except for Gus (played masterfully by George Eads). I hate this movie but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Draculas Curse) it should have won an academy award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a disgraceful and tacky film. Lifetime you have sunken to whole new low. Someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies again. Also was this supposed to be a horror film because it was a lot more funny than scary. For shame Lifetime, For shame.#0
6159_1#Why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers? That point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie. When I see a movie and am forced to think, `Man, I wish I was watching the Mighty Ducks. I know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back.#0
6137_1#Whew. What can be said about Gymkata that hasnt already? This is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end. If you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect movie to get. From Cabots wild-style mullet/sweater combo to Parmistan (and its four billion assorted ninjas), everything about this film reeks of crap. Pick this one up and Yakmallah it for yourself. It is easily one of the best bad movies I have ever seen, and that is saying quite a bit.#0
9103_1#Alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie. As for 1999 i feel that one of the top five films was Cruel Intentions. It had everything a great movie should have except for an original story, being adapted from a novel it was still damn good. On to Cruel Intentions 2 which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called manchester prep. Which must not have happened. Actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand. Before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director Roger Kumble did this one also. Well 1 minute into this movie i was disappointed. It starts off with a rehash of the opening of the original with a different twist sebastian instead of putting the shrinks daughters naked picture on the net he puts the schools principals wife in the school directory naked. This would have been alright if the lady was not like 50. And basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe carbon copy of the original. Which i understand the if there is nothing wrong with it leave it the way it was. But you can not do that with a movie. This actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part 1. But with Sebastian being more or less just a prankster and Kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator he was in the real story, this movie had no foundation to it. Whoever did the casting on this thing was way off. They could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no, they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking actors. I am using this term although i dont know why. They for sure didnt do any in this movie. All this movie is a bunch of one liners that dont even match the wit that the original had, well some of them did but that was just because they were from part 1. Another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from teir parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used, as if to show why the kids are like this. It didnt work though. The best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world. The on screen tension that was there made the film what it was. This thing Really ruins the experience of the first one stay way from this.#0
7708_10#Shakespeares  The Tempest  is a model for this exceptional science fiction film. We look for differences. Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, are stranded on a Mediterranean island.  Morbius and Altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair. Ariel is a spirit. Robby the Robot is a man-made servant. Calibans evil hardly approaches that of Monsters of the Id. Shakespeare spares Prospero. Morbius dies when Altair 4 blows up.  The Tempest  is a comedy.  Forbidden Planet  is a tragedy. We wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the Krell in some future time. Anne Francis is Altaira. Jack Kelly is Lieutentant Farman. Kelly starred with James Garner in the comedy/western TV series,  Maverick.  #1

5666_4#I respect Alex Cox the filmmaker, I really do. Hes like the kid at school who you think at first is just trying a little too hard to be  different , a literary punk-rocker who has dipped more than his feet into spaghetti westerns and science fiction and fringe-culture and come out into the world ready to take s    on but then you see what he can actually do, the talent and raw feverish artistry and moments of true absurd hilarity capable of him, and you are ready to see whatever he has to offer. But theres two sides to his proverbial coin he can either really hit it out of the park (Repo Man, Sid & Nancy, Walker arguably) or just try just a little too hard and pull way too many pretentious rabbits out of the hat (Straight to Hell). Death and the Compass falls into the latter category, and while I respect its (mostly) original approach to tackling a detective-killer story, it too falls on its face and its weirdness becomes oddly dull. While the murder plot itself contains an intention for the audience that this isnt something weve seen before, that its in a society with a good many rioters and architecture suggesting Alphavilles next decrepit wave, it too fizzles out very quickly. Whats the conflict here? I was never that much engaged with Boyles own personal mission to find this killer, and only mildly caught up in the few flashes of deranged scenes of the killer (and/or killers) going after people like in the building early on (Cox himself has an amusing cameo). And just when I started to think it was leading up to something spectacular, with Boyle and Eccleston in that big ( not as big as you think ) building in the South section of the city, it suddenly gives us a  TWIST  that we know in the back of our minds is coming but hope isnt, and it deflates any of the humdrum mystery its been leading up to. For all of Coxs uncanny touches as a filmmaker, for all of his opposition to spoon-feeding the audience with a conventional approach, which I do respect, Death and the Compass ultimately cuts one off at the brain-stem; its masturbatory.#0
10194_3#This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930s about one of Spains poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, lets admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth its a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, the horror!. Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesnt Buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?#0
10016_8#If there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing. The premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about. However, there is not much tension, and Williams mild mannered portrayal doesnt do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy. One thing is certain Taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort.#1
7697_9#This is another great movie I had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al). Back in the late 80s I was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new about the big three JC, SH & YB. I wasnt sure what to expect when I payed my hard earned money to see this in a  Triple bill of Classics  at the old Scala. I need not have worried, I was left breathless by this movie. If youre a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and havent seen this movie, do so NOW #1
3417_10#Before seeing this, I was put off by the subject matter, but this is not your average triumph over adversity story. Although this is technically about blind Tibetan kids climbing Mt. Everest, there is so much more to it. This movie shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind mountain climber/athlete and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are both exceptional in their own ways, but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids. Erik wants them to reach the summit while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment. The nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The most profound scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school. The most moving for me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. I could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school, he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you will love this.#1
11509_8#Its a genuine shame that this spin-off TV series inspired by the superior made-for-TV pictures  The Night Stalker  and  The Night Strangler  only lasted a single season and twenty episodes, because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor (Carl Kolchaks spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor Tony Vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear), clever writing, nifty supernatural menaces (gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in  The Spanish Moss Murders,   The Sentry,  and  Horror in the Heights,  plus you cant go wrong with such triedntrue fright favorites as zombies, vampires, werewolves, and witches), colorful characters, lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars (legendary biker flick icon William Smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in  The Energy Eater  while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden, and William Daniels in juicy roles), effective moments of genuine suspense (the sewer-set climax of  The Spanish Moss Murders  in particular was truly harrowing), and, best of all, the one and only Darren McGavin in peak zesty form as the brash, aggressive, and excitable, but basically decent, brave, and honest small-time Chicago, Illinois newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak. Kolchak was the quintessential 70s everyman protagonist, a wily and quick-witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble. Moreover, the occasionally bumbling Kolchak was anything but superhuman; he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat, yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters Simon Oakland was perfect as Carls chronically ill-tempered boss Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as the prissy Ron Updyke made for an ideal comic foil, Ruth McDevitt was simply delightful as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles, and Carol Ann Susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie Monique Marmelstein (who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes). Granted, the show did suffer from lackluster make-up and special effects (the titular lycanthrope in  The Werewolf  unfortunately resembles a Yorkshire terrier!) and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters (the headless motorcyclist in  Chopper,  Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in  The Youth Killer), but even the second-rate shows are redeemed by the programs trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and McGavins boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence.#1
1712_9#This movie was disaster at Box Office, and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie, sweetness of the story. Music was good, story is very simple and old, but presentation of such story is very good, Director tried his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. Rest star cast was simply okay. Music and all songs are good, Himesh is impressive as an Singer here. Dont miss this movie, its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us. Abhay best work till date. I will give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.#1
1709_3#I got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with Zombie Bloodbath as one of its alternative titles. Perversely, this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other one is really bad! This film is pretty bad too; obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself Zombie Bloodbath and expect to see a masterpiece, and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on displaybut it all feels very old and tired, which isnt helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line. Its just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc. The film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what youre in for; low quality zombie garbage. Theres plenty of gore in the film, and its a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap too, and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be Romeros superior Day of the Dead, although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore. It all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall I cant say I was impressed with it!#0
8214_4#This doesnt quite plumb the depths of Creepshow 3, but it comes close. It also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is distracting to say the least. Overall basically not dissimilar from the two newer Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. But theres nothing really spectacular here.#0
2374_9#The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of H. G. Wells great novel,  War of the Worlds . This is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them. No other version of WotW has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as Wells wrote it, but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place the last year of the 19th Century, 1900  using Wells original setting, in and near Woking, England. This is overall a splendid film, portraying for the first time the War of the Worlds as Wells wrote it. Despite its slight defects, it is far and away better than any of its hyped-up competitors. If you want to see H. G. Wells War of the Worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film #1
5243_9#I sought this film out because Im a new Frain fan and wanted to see more of his work. First of all, his Irish accent is great. Hes got a keen ear for dialects, it seems. His acting was marvelous, as usual. James Frain aside, I thought the film was very well done. It showed the conflict in Northern Ireland as the  mess  it really is. Both sides are guilty of grave injustices, and the men drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstances. All in all, a well acted, touchingbut troubling film.#1
4553_10#As far as I know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal, Id agree with him. This is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy/man with a special body part helping him. Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christy Browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left foot though, he can write with it, paint with it and hold things with it. He learns to speak later in the film, it is very good for a guy like him. Also starring Home Alone 2s Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA winning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Make Up Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on Britains Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The Worlds Greatest Actor, and the film was number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Outstanding!#1
3447_1#This is easily one of the worst 5 movies Ive ever seen. Its not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline. This movie is agonizingly slow and I was bored for almost all 98 minutes. While the acting is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and plodding with no real direction. Occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event. Im not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots, they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script. As a huge fan of good horror movies, Im always irritated that something this bad gets made. Save yourself 98 minutes youll never get back.#0
3031_2#Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kellys clichéd, patchy, overwrought screenplay. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story  sort of . Dont be fooled by this films multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface. It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it.#0
12180_3#This film is absolutely awful, but nevertheless, it can be hilarious at times, although this humor is entirely unintentional. Thats being pretty generous, Id say.#0
4544_10#Okay, I know I shouldnt like this movie but I do. From Pat Moritas loveable interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Lenos annoying yell, I laughed throughout this movie.As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, its a good mvie. My favorite part is Morita talking to his boss in Tokyo with the drinking a close second.#1
4544_1#This movie is just not worth your time. Its reliance upon New-Age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been re-cycled countless times. I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, in spite of the truth.#0
4174_9# when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary. Although few lines, it was kind of weird to see this movie, no subs, in a language unknown. A friend of mine sent a VHS, included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to English. with her translation next to me, I began watching this tale (it is indeed a tale), and from the very first tunes of the whistling melody during opening credits I was stuck. the colours, that minimal acting (well, in most cases), absurd comedy, slapstick, thoughtful, beautiful along with a few other movies (Paris, Texas and Nenette et Boni), this one is able to speak to anyones heart - without words. Whenever you get the chance, see it. Whatever you do - dont miss it. Its a once in a lifetime experience. Oh, acting is great, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) like this.#1
11739_4#The often-reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a  delightful romance  and that Sanders is  superb.  Maltin must have confused this movie with something else. Sanders is snide and droll and superb, as usual,  you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery,  Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three,  but dull, wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately. The storyline itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels, is entertaining enough, but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as  Marie Antoinette , and certainly the deplorable  Forever Amber  (which screams for a classy remake). Though, in his defense, Sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character, it is all for naught. I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan, but this is 1946, and it is one of Sirks earliest American efforts, lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid, breast-heaving potboilers. Sirk is just getting his feet wet here, and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with  Magnificent Obsession , and hit his stride, bombarding us with such estrogen-fests as  All That Heaven Allows ,  Written on the Wind , and  Imitation of Life . But  Scandal In Paris  is hardly his best work  a relatively low-budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming.#0
7212_2#Why every horror director wants to imitate  The Exorcist  is a complete riddle to me, as William Friedkins  classic  is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. And yet heres another clean rip-off, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leilas behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest doesnt believe it but when Johns body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leilas demonic behavior becomes more noticeable  Exorcism  is not only very unoriginal, its also an insufferably boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama thatll nearly put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and theres quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an awful film, end of story. Other European  The Excorcist  rip-offs are  The Antichrist  and  Beyond the Door  and they suck as well #0
5237_10#We all create our own reality, or do we? That is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality. Blending Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of `Who are we and what is our place in the universe?, and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes. The film centers on Bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, `The Sea That Thinks. As he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer, writing the screenplay. Before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. Ultimately, de Graaffs film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be, or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses.

9361_1#When i saw the preview for this on TV i was thinking,  ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie  but it was not. it was not scary at all! acting was good, plot was horrible, the military bid was just plain stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could of done better than this piece of crap. The movie made it sound like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf, instead he turned psycho and bit some doctors throat out. If you have read some of my other reviews on other movies, there all positive, but this one is not simply because the story was terrible. One out of 10 max. Im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick, but i bet you didnt expect this. Beyond Loch Nes was way better than this movie, heck, any movie thats on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.#0
4935_1# Cavemen  exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, heres the show The Cavemen are an alternate race, they face prejudice, etc. Quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created; almost being worthy of jail time for the writers. One show featured the cavemen going into a club, trying to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. It was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute Andy Rooney dialog, followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, heres an example of the dialog  Youre sure youre okay with going out with a caveman.   Yeah, thats fine. Ive had like 10 - thousand!  Hilarious Possibly the best writing Ive ever witnessed. (Unratable honestly)#0
12404_1#I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock off, when watching it i got the chills, I even wet myself a little. When that Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord Asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time. Any way back on track Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being. Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas past. This movie is so bad I put my new born child in a box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox. He can raise my kid Im not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert Ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.#0
5433_1#Noel Coward,a witty and urbane man,was friends with Louis Mountbatten.Mr Coward,a long-time admirer of all things naval,was commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of Mountbattens ship.In a peculiarly British way it was considered that a film about the Royal Navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda.It was also considered a good idea to have Mr Coward play the part of the ships captain.Amang the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship,the ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated  point  songs does not come very high up the list at Admiralty House,or at least one would hope not.A captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike. Mr Coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at Drury Lane and Binkie Beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame,mould and direct a ships crew in wartime must be brought into question.He folds himself languorously around the bridge,patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers,he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home. Much is made of the  warship as a microcosm of British Society theme,and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys,canny northerners etc.without whom no war can be fought.They spend most of their time on board smoking,moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up. Never mind,theres plenty more where they came from.Once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking,moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up .By contrast Mr Coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up.He,his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames.That nice young master Johnny Mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships Mr Coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master.He marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek,presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion. So yes,we do have a microcosm of British society here,but perhaps not in the way the makers of  In which we serve  intended. At the end Mr Coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past him, Goodbye Edwards,it was a privilege to sail with you he enunciates as if he was reciting  How now brown cow . It may have been David Leans feature debut,but the hand of Noel Coward looms large right across this picture.He was a funny and clever man,better suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry song.He had a talent to amuse,no doubt,but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue. Being Noel Coward was a full-time job,he had no time to be a real person.#0
8242_8#I watched FIDO on some movie channel and I have to say that Ive become an instant fan. The film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s, you know the wholesome decade when they danced to Elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it. People were so naive back then that its frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here. Its a shame this film wasnt a bigger hit. It deserved more recognition. Its much better than the stuff from Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Oh well. Its an instant classic nonetheless.#1

12255_10#Of the spate of Austen films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, more even than  Persuasion,  which was the one that converted me to Austeniana. Before seeing this  Emma  I had seen two previous versions, but in one Emma seemed all wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other she seemed half wrong, like a possible impostor, whereas here she seemed just right, young and silly and stubborn. In general I thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well; indeed it is one of the sweetest, merriest things I have ever seen, rather in the nature of a Christmas treat. The script is unusually well formed, and the adapters additions, like the shaft of light that reveals Harriet to Emma in church, are all in keeping. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would have expected, but I enjoyed him very much he strongly brings out the plain-spoken, practical side of the character, in contrast with Emmas affectations, and his choleric outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of almost Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emmas protégé is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be. And as in the same producers  Pride and Prejudice,  care is taken that the eventual couplings of characters can be believed--uniquely in some cases. For me this production was and remains a delight.#1
289_10#I love all of the movies by Michael Landon Jr. And Michael Landon Jrs casting of Dale Midkiff as  Clark Davis could not of been any better. Dale Midkiff has the ways to pull off this character. I look forward to many more movies from him in the future.#1
553_7#After losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman, a trail boss winds up in the Yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states. While there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling. Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup.#1
11450_1#I got to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out Aug 3rd. It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as Hot Rod Kimble. Hes plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father. When we meet him, hes jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a Jackass movie if he wasnt honestly trying to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his crew. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rods mom, Marie. She remarried Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Franks a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls. Its clear that Rods not going to earn Franks respect till he can beat him. We find out Frank needs a $50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he can beat his ass once hes healed, and prove himself a man. A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to go big on one stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch- at a childrens birthday party. There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world tunes in. Does he make the jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise the $50k? Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod? Wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out.#0
2975_4#I watched this immediately after seeing HILLSIDE CANNIBALS so anything would have been an improvement . On top of that it stops me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 DAYS LATER and its sequel . Unfortunately the more I watched it the more I realised how well made Danny Boyles original was and how much this movie influenced 28 WEEKS LATER  Obviously youre reminded of the earlier film THE CRAZIES which also reminded me of the later 28 films . Bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending youll have worked out that basically everyone dies . The problem with this is youll instantly be reminded of how the British franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget . Not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie . ZOMBI 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter audience#0
8853_7#In New York, Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an addicted executive of a real estate office that has embezzled a large amount for his addiction and expensive way of life with his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei). When an audit is scheduled in his department, he becomes desperate for money. His baby brother Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke) is a complete loser that owes three months of child support to his daughter, and is having a love affair with Gina every Thursday afternoon. Andy plots a heist of the jewelry of their parent in a Saturday morning without the use of guns, expecting to find an old employee working and without financial damage to his parents, since the insurance company would reimburse the loss. On Monday morning, we would raise the necessary money he needs to cover his embezzlement. He invites Hank to participate, since he is very well known in the mall where the jewelry is located and could be recognized. However, Hank yellows and invites the thief Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. OByrne) to steal the store, but things go wrong when their mother Nanette (Rosemary Harris) comes to work as the substitute for the clerk and Bobby brings a hidden gun. Nanette reacts and kills Bobby but she is also lethally shot. After the death of Nanette, their father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) decides to investigate the robbery with tragic consequences. Title (Brazil)  Antes Que o Diabo Saiba Que Você Está Morto  ( Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead )#1
4901_9#No message. No symbolism. No dark undercurrents.Just a wonderful melange of music, nostalgia and good fun put to-gether by people who obviously had a great time doing it. Its a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios. Of course ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth watching. And Cleo Laines brilliant jazz singing is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. This goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime I feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle. Just a wonderful film!#1
10386_8#what is wrong with you people, if you werent blown away by the action car sequences and jessica Simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head. Of course the film isnt a masterpiece, i dont think it was aiming to be. It was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. The movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didnt bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica Simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. All in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.#1
12030_1#Baptists at Our Barbecue is the best film ever made. Now, that I got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken, let me begin my short overview of this tacky, offensive, pretentious and boring hunk of junk I guess you could consider a movie. First of all, the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of Christian Vuissa, and the tacky, overly preachy, whiny and stilted screenplay by F. Mathew Smith. I really despise the fact that it sends a very pro-Mormon, and sort of anti-every other religion message. Yes, the story is about a small town half full with Mormons and half full with Baptists. It shows all the main and role-model characters being Mormon, and being so nice and perfect, yet they are being picked on by the evil, conniving and very judgmental Baptists. It shows how beautiful Mormons are and how cold-hearted and ignorant Baptists are, instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic. Im a part of neither religion (Im actually an atheist), but this offended me, along with another countless amount of Baptists most likely. It shows the Baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the Mormons, and the Mormons being very accepting, when again, in reality there is a mutual like/dislike between them. Sorry, I didnt mean to go off on a rant. my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).#0
7505_9#If theres one genre that Ive never been a fan of, its the biopic. Always misleading, filled with false information, over-dramatized scenes, and trickery all around, biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. Skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and moviegoers objected to Gretchen Mol given the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didnt have the chops for the part. I never doubted Mol could handle the part since, but I never expected to as blown as away by her performance as I was upon just viewing the film hours ago. Mol delivers a knockout Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950s pin-up girl, who, after an early life of abuse (depicted subtlety and tastefully done, something few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time. The picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story. Director/co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turners fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending. Still, credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully. Come Oscar time, Mol, Turner, and Harron should be receiving nominations. Doubt it will happen, though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them. 9/10#1
11106_10#The Sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed TV series ever, so naturally my expectations were through the roof, and yet the show surpassed them. I love the mafia and crime genre in film and I enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds, but this is so much more. 86+ hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia/action stories, but also to be a great family drama, a shocking character study, a laugh-out-loud comedy, a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil, and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one. David Chases epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more, and cements HBO as the closest TV can get to cinematic perfection, paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away. Whether you love or hate the ending, or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself. The iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history. There are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show, so if youre thinking of watching something else instead, do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit.#1
11082_1#I know its a Power-Rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie? If they are going to write a plot with crayons, at least have the decency to make it silly. Its kind of hilarious if you watch this. We have a typical family filled with cliched characters (father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself LOLOL), air-head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting, and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space. Funny stuff! 1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously.#0
10899_3#Cheap and mind-blisteringly dull story and acting. Not a single good line, not even a line bad enough to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the blooper reel included with the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic, and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable. The homoerotic overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying, and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers. Im not gay enough to appreciate it, but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake.#0
7184_7#I absolutely love this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first. The first episodes humor is not the best, and they struggle to properly start the series. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters. As a first episode, it really doesnt accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good. The episode is not bad by any means, but as the show progresses it becomes better and better, so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show.#1
11179_9# Pet Sematary  succeeds on two major situations. First, its a scary Horror movie. Those that just arent produced in these days. Second, its an emotional, clever movie overall. So if you are looking for chills, scares, creepiness and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs, and gruesome effects; this is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan.  Something is for sure I dont wanna be buried, in a pet sematary #1
4489_9#This film is NOT about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment. Its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one. The cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time, hence the name fraidy cat. Fraidy Cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him off, but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts. very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy.  i watched this movie almost every day as a child o)#1
7875_3#Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you didnt like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel well, I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.#0
6147_1#I really dont get all the adulation that this film has received. Its mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie Nashs affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about tolerable, but whats with all the praise for Russell Crowes performance? The man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowes performance is little short of caricature. It is also rather offensive. And, dare I say, just on the right side of being truly terrible#0
4977_7#So many educational films are nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery, saved only by the fact that  MST3K  mocks them ( Why Study Industrial Arts?  comes to mind).  Hemo the Magnificent  is actually quite well done. Its all about blood, the heart, and the circulatory system. I admit that I dont remember everything from it, but it does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but entertaining. I guess that you can always count on June Foray (most famously the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she plays a deer here). Since  Hemo the Magnificent  itself may be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is in  Gremlins  a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming.#1
5409_10#I so love this movie! The animation is great (for a pokémon movie), the cgi looks so awesome. I love the music in the movie. So great they kept the Japanese music. But overall, awesome movie! Cant wait to own the USA version on dvd!#1
5296_1#Im not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really lame. Even on a nudity-and-gore level, its incredibly boring (there is some of both, but its all sort ofmeh). Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all,  Plan 9 From Outer Space  played in theaters). There is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere. Its so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it.#0
2667_8#I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubricks The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever. The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10#1
2714_10#This was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. that I wished Id captured forever on VHS. Wont it ever air again?  It was utterly appealing, funny, flirtatious, and original. Maybe not like Sherlock Holmes original, I actually think Quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky Holmes ever could.#1
122_9#I had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical Genre Hollywood film. Story lines fail, and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste. But, then I saw Zentropa (Europa) and my faith was renewed. Not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945. We have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death. Unlike many films it doesnt cut after one second of showing (for example) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a mans final moments. I think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means. I would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email. Enjoy it!#1
10850_3#This movie has a few things going for it right off the bat. Having Dani Filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie. Admittedly, I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead. The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. For being low budget, the special effects werent bad either. The ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish. In the end, Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence, but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline, it just doesnt work too well. Rent it though, if youre a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite.#0

7830_10#In  Die Nibelungen Siegfried , Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Kriemhild seeks revenge. She marries Hagen, and through a series of events, finally engages in a very drastic (but fitting) action at the end. One of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals. Attila the Hun (called Etzel in the movie) is shown as the strange person from the east, possibly an allusion to the Soviet Union. Obviously, it was not Fritz Langs fault that Hitler used  The Nibelungenlied  for German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what the Fuhrer liked about the story. Nonetheless, this is an absolutely formidable movie.#1
6645_1#This guy has no idea of cinema. Okay, it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth, and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship. This all is very good, but look carefully HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB! The scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and, with a disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say about the subject, so he over-licitates with violence, nakedness and gutter language. How is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art? Why dont they let him succumb in piece?#0
2266_1#Ringmaster, Jerry Springers pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First of all, it was made. Second of all, people went to see it. Third, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, im 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good. Most crappy movies have their moments, (even Godzilla had a few cool special effects) this films moment was when I left the theater nauseated. The only thing that possibly couldve made this movie any worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to stare at crap for an hour and a half, ill take a dump in a can. If anyone didnt utterly despise this movie, I pity you, and your children, and your childrens childrens children; however, contrary to Springers beliefs, I clearly dont condone children having sex.#0
8129_9#This early sci-fi masterwork by Herbert George Wells with music by Arthur Bliss is a powerful piece of film-making. Adapted from Wells somewhat different work by the author, it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of peace. The structure is that after a contrasted-pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war, the script allows the war to happen. Two families, the Cabells and the Passworthys disagree about what may happen; Passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilizations  automatic  progress; Cabell is the thinker, the doubter. Their city Everytown--obviously London-- becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks, a magnificent war march by Bliss, and the end of civilization. The second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a  Boss , played with bravura by Ralph Richardson, whose woman, lovely Margaretta Scott, is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concrete-bound dictator type. He is trying to rebuild old WWI airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom; a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes--etc.--everlastingly; this is Wells comment on war versus progress. The survivors are subject to a plague called  The Wandering Sickness  also. Enter a modern flying machine piloted by the Cabell of the first section of the film, now part of Wings Over the World, an International Scientists Coalition, who are planning to end warfare forever. This flight-suited modernist has fascinating conversations with the Boss and his woman, their attraction being evident; then Boss sends up his aircraft against them, the Scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the  Gas of Peace  onto the ruins of Everytown. Only the Boss dies, fighting too hard against the pacifying. The film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers. In section three, a future Cabell argues with a future Passworthy over the morality of human science. Passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the Moon; Cabell champions mans right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons. The son of Passworthy and Cabells daughter, are the astronauts being sent. Theotocopulos, a religious-minded Luddite, makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the citys Forum and leads an attack on the space gun that is to fire the new rocket free of Earths gravity. The climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully; the denouement and ending is a speech by Cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned.  It is all the universe--or nothing!  Cabell tells Passworthy.  Which shall it be?  As Cabell, Raymond Massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance; he is thoughtful, compassionate, and reasonable, a true scientist. As the rabble-rouser who wants to end the Age of Science, Cedric Hardwicke is perfect and powerful. Edward Chapman playing Passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear. The storyline is logical, frequently beautiful and always interesting. Given the near-extinction of mankind, the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer. This is a triumph for the director, William Cameron Menzies, for Bliss and for all concerned. Listen to the dialogue with someone you love; within its constructed limits, this is a thinking mans drama debating two possible human futures--progress or its reactionary opposite.#1
94_10#I am a huge John Denver fan. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and later release. The later release is missing several songs though. I see that it has been released this year with all original songs. To my surprise I found the original CD for sale at $75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas Cd would be worth that much. To me no amount is worth selling this treasure. It is my favorite Christmas CD. I have never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would love to have either version. If anyone has one available please let me know. Thanks#1
1051_9#This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon. The  sisters  in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council. It is rather long -- about two hours -- but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges. It will leave you, as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred. How and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the Cameroon? Have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses? Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court, against the express wishes of the husband, a one time event? Im not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions. They made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie they made deserves a wide audience.#1
11230_1#In sixth grade, every teacher I had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester. Every class had something to do with this terrible show. We watched it in English and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters. In math we talked about charts and other sea crap. In science we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so this wasnt a 100% waste of time). All day everyday was torture. Not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well. I could see if this was a new series or something, but it was, like, 93. Im still trying to block this out.#0
1845_4#Losing Control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world. Usually, they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent, interspersed with copious disrobing. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make-believe world. Finally, a note of caution about the DVD under review. Both the cover and the disc state R-rated and running time as 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why Jennifer Ludlows performance is cut short just as shes getting started. 4 stars.#0
10752_10#This was the most visually stunning, moving, amazing and incredible story Ive ever experienced. Quite frankly, even those adjectives just cannot describe it. I cant just choose one scene that stood out for me. I suppose if I had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator, who were unaware of what was going on, as they finally emerge to the horrific scene; the shock and disbelief of the onlookers; and finally the silence.  If you plan to watch, be sure to grab a box of tissues. Youll need them. I know that I did.#1
11557_8#Often laugh out loud, sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys -- Lemmon a neurotic clean  house husband  and Matthau a slob sportswriter -- who decide to live together to cut down on expenses.  Very entertaining.#1
2946_1#I must say that during my childhood Im quite proud of a lot of the movies Ive rented. The exception being Theodore Rex. Talk about the all time swindler movie in any actors resume. Could you just imagine what Whoopies fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap  Hey Whoop, you ever seen that show Dinosaurs, yeah well theyre making a movie out of it, and you get to see Germany!  After that that agent must have referenced Star Wars a lot. Whenever I think of my all-time list of worst movies I dont even mention this one, because like a raped step-child, I try hard to repress that it ever happened. Screw you Whoopie, just be glad people only acknowledge Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff.#0
1888_4#This movie reminds me of  Irréversible (2002) , another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature. I did not like the movie but I cannot say that it is a bad movie, it is just special. I reminds me also of  Camping Cosmos (1996)  where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say the hell is on this world.#0
6709_10#What I love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and its a blast to experience their everyday love, humor and adventure. The literature of magic is so diverse, portraying the ideas of classical, medieval and modern wizardry, like Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina the Teenage Witch, this show is so fun and unique because it lets us experience a lot of that modern wizardry, seven seasons worth! This show has so many great qualities and its a joy to watch Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and  other  realm. I would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic #1
9646_7#There is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship--one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. And there is also emotion in the inner-workings of Mathieus family dealing w/ his mothers problems--and how that comes to bear on their relationship. But the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless Im just too dumb to pick up on them). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the boys break-up? And the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first. It seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills, or some male nudity. But as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying.#1
5150_7#Even though Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to Hitlers life and yes, this is dramatised, but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years, during this documentary that only deals with Hitler from boyhood until he became Chancellor of Germany, including The Night of the Long Knives. This TV-film (also a two-part mini-series) shows how a series of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, e.g. the financial disaster of 1930. The series follows Hitler and little else, apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, valuable and filled with interesting actors, yet I feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography; most actors are portrayed in half-body shots which (for me) makes for a theatrical stance, not cinematic. The tempo is at times drowsy, and the film does suffer from it, being approximately 2,5 hours long.#1
1442_7#City Hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country, state or any sort of major political table. Granted it shines on New York City which is a huge political arena, especially nowadays, but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayors right hand. Director Harold Becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done Mercury Rising, Malice, and Domestic Disturbance and I think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault. I mean City Hall is meant to be a political drama, not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand outwhat elseor rather who elseAl Pacino. The film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city. As the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss, and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city. As events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up. The problem with City Hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors. Everyone isokay. There is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy. And of course you have Al Pacino in a rather small supporting role but hes absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film. It almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them. So City Hall could have been this huge political epic drama/thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one BUT it still has to be seen for Pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics. If you just wont see this movie than find Pacinos speech at James Bone funeral because the word electrifying doesnt seem to give it justice but you can see what makes Al Pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it. If youre a John Cusack fan which I amhes definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice. A decent movie but unfortunately potential loss. 7.5/10#1
2009_10#Paul & Grace Hartman are my husbands grandparents. They were both deceased when we met so watching old movies is a good way to see them and their work. I have always enjoyed old movies and was very happy to discover that this was also a very good one.#1
291_10#Zombie Chronicles isnt something to shout about, its obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining B-movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick. The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but thats what makes it more entertaining, the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget, the gore is also great and gross, the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale. Zombie Chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there, if you love low budget B-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out Zombie Chronicles.#1

1909_1#One of the worst romantic comedies (nay, worst movies) Ive ever seen. Boy (who works as a phone psychic!) must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams. Hilarity does not ensue. Boredom, light gay-bashing, and horrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his crappy dialogue, youll like this movie. Be smart. Avoid this. if you see it, destroy the copy.#0
4103_7#The lead characters in this movie fall into two categories smart and stupid. Simple enough. I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment. The best Czech movies I have seen are 1) Peliky and 2) Tmavomodrý Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you have seen the absolute best of Czech cinema.#1
1251_9#This documentary explores a story covered in Pilgers latest book  Freedom Next Time , which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is not easy viewing, but  Stealing a Nation  is John Pilger at his best. Recommended.#1
4901_4#The BFG is one of Roald Dahls most cherished books, but in this animated adaptation the magic just isnt there. This version remains pretty faithful to Dahls original story so one cant lay the blame on John Hambleys script. If anything the fault lies with the colourless animation, the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice-overs. One would be right to expect this story to make for a happy, vibrant, fun-filled movie.. instead, the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch. Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first! All the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a childrens classic. Jason voices the BFG quite well (one of the few pluses in the film) but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality. The rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired, with very little to bring the characters to life. Similarly, the BFG is the only character that is imaginatively animated - Sophie lacks appeal, and the giants are boringly designed (and look almost indistinguishable from each other). Even the places are uninventive; Giant Country especially comes up short, being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons. At 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy, yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences. Little of Dahls mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily. One chapter in the book deals with the BFGs love of  whizzpopping  (farting) and is laugh-out-loud hilarious. In the film, the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling. I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest, fun and enjoyment, but what I got was pretty much the opposite! This one is a failed misfire that simply doesnt match the calibre of the book in any department - unfortunately, therefore, it must go down as one to skip.#0
5571_1#Nothing new in this hackneyed romance with characters put into unbelievable situations, speaking dialogue that borders on the ridiculous. This is an example of another movie put into production before serious script problems were solved. Dont waste your time.#0
7626_9#I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. Im still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell portrays Elvis, right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face. Sometimes its scary how much he looks, acts, and talks like the real Elvis. Thankfully this is being released on DVD, so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film. I have heard the detractors, who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things left out, but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with, and that this was being shown on television (just two years after Elviss death!) that he did a fine job with this. In fact I havent seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this one. Highly recommended.#1
12214_3#Well what I can say about this movie is that its great to see so many Asian faces. What I didnt like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. The Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead, the white guy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the  keeping it real  black cab driver. Plus all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. The story plot itself was fun but pretty much how I thought the story would unravel. Then again when watching romantic comedies you cant expect much but then again I would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once. The parents are the best part of the flick.#0
9289_7#In THE BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a real envoy from the United States who was responsible for truly opening up Japan to International relations in the late 1850s. Before him, Commodore Perry basically pushed into Japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived just a bit later, worked through the details and helped ensure compliance--as many of the Japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty. All this is true and shown in the film. According to some other sources I found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese Geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film (hence, the title). PS--Read through the trivia for this film. You find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston) where Wayne apparently knocked him out  Based on what Ive read about Huston and the way he got along with actors, this is an incident I tend to believe. And, its also a nice example of John Wayne  diplomacy .#1
823_4#First, it takes a full half hour to get Hackman out of jail and to start doing the job. What a waste of time, we all know Hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere, simply proving to us that Hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife. All of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action, intrigue and plot twists. By the time the real action gets going, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great as usual, and the other actors as well, but this is a dud of the first magnitude.#0
9359_8#The feel of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandlers performance was very inspiring. As he played a very rattled and fragile character, he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role. His character was really interesting. I can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as Sandler made me. For someone who plays primarily comedy roles, he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input. I especially loved the scene in which Adam and Dons characters rode the motorized scooter around the city. I familiarized with the moment, because it seemed like Don was witnessing one thing Adam does to get away from it all. With his video games, music, and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth the watch.#1
10851_9#I found Still Crazy to be marvelously entertaining, and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late 60s, early 70s rock. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD (dont worry, its only been three times) and she loves it too. My only problem with Still Crazy is that it wasnt hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience.#1
4924_7#A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague. Its an imaginative and intelligently written story, one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease. A blight on society as it were. Its noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created. Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway, this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end. Not essential film-noir, and maybe not even essential Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day. 7.5/10#1
11640_9#What I liked best in this film is that like the films of Hitchcock, it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously.  Red Eye  is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling. If you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller,  Red Eye  might be your ticket.#1
1795_8#Evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother. The movie split in time, is magically shot, amazingly acted and has a touching script. Vanessa Redgrave plays Anne Grant Lord, a woman sun-setting out of life. Lying in her bed, her mind remembering and misfiring, she recalls her first mistake. Claire Danes plays the young Anne, giving a youthful vitality to dying bed ridden woman. Daughters Nina (Toni Collette) and Constance (Natasha Richardson) try to decipher the real story from the disheartening dementia. Her first mistake revolves around Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson); the man her best friend Lila (Mamie Gummer) deeply loved. The daughters must come to terms with their mothers past, and their futures. The cast is glowing in Evening. The collective acting energy of this movie could have powered the equipment for the production of this entire film. I am so glad to see Claire Danes working again, especially in this role. She is so young, and alive, fully living the joys, mistakes and heartbreak of young Annes first mistake. This is a true feat when you realize she is playing a woman, dying in bed. When her life overwhelms her, you can feel her desire to crack and her hopeless hope that she wont. Some of her facial expressions grinded on me a little, but over all her performance was so radiant, I was left with that only as a side note. Toni Collette continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress without being a super model. She plays the black sheep of the family; a little lost. Nina finds a great deal of strength in her mothers mistake. Collette delicately avoids creating a cruel character who revels in the mistakes of her mother, instead choosing the wiser path of learning from her mothers mistakes. There is a great deal of infighting between Nina and her sister Constance. Their fights remind me of ones I have with my sister all the time. Mamie Gummer, who plays Annes youthful best friend, is wonderful. Her character is stuck between her heart and her status in society. Even when she is crying and her heart is breaking, she is incredibly regal and charming. I cant wait to see her act in something else in the future. Vanessa Redgraves performance is very hard for me to describe. Her talent at making her mental status ambiguous without being wacko or even especially tragic is why it is so powerful. The audience does not know if she is making up the story because she is slipping away or if these events truly happened. Physically and emotionally speaking, Redgrave is acting in a box. Not much physical space and limited emotional range might have been a stunner to a lesser actress but she makes the limitations work for her. I was constantly amazed. The movie is definitely woman-focused but the men in the movie are not just accessories. Patrick Wilson is mesmerizing as Harris. It is no wonder that everyone in the movie is in love with him, I sure was. Buddy Wittenborn is Lilas brother, spiraling out of control. Hugh Dancy spirals Buddy out of control without sending his acting down the drain. Glen Close has my favorite scene in the movie. It reminded me of the famous scene from Monsters Ball. It is terrible and jaw dropping grief. I was utterly stunned. The one acting disappointment was Natasha Richardson. While her fight scenes were memorable, most of her acting reeks of melodrama. It would have suited her to take an acting bath before we had to breathe her stink. Its a good thing she wasnt in charge of the visuals. The visuals of the movie are sparkling. Cinematographer Gyula Pados couldnt make a film richer in color, light so perfectly matched to mood and emotion. The visual concepts of the flash back sequences are powerful and resonating. There were many scenes that could have been stopped, printed, mounted and sold as art. I admit it, I cried. Evening is a powerful movie. Evening is defiantly a chick flick but a really great chick flick. If you want to impress a woman with a movie choice, pick Evening.#1
5318_7#Ida Lupino was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in Hollywood under the studio system. Not surprisingly, she also tackled proto-feminist themes that, when touched at all, were approached in so gingerly a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about. In Outrage, she treats rape and its aftermath, and though throughout the short movie its referred to as `criminal assault, she leaves, for once, no doubt about what happened. It was a courageous movie to come out in 1950, and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings. Lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene, and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental, ending up talky and didactic. Yes, Lupino had important information to impart, but she didnt trust the narrative to speak for itself. Her cast, pleasant but bland and generic, werent much help, either, reverting to melodramatic postures or homespun reassurance. But Outrage was a breakthrough, blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is, and what it really means to its victims.#1
7223_10#The comparison to Sleuth, the earlier stage-play-turned-film, is obvious and upon my first viewing I too thought Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, many more repeat viewings in it than Sleuth. Ill leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film  I wonder if it wouldnt bewelljust a trifle starry-eyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaborationwhere I could count on no sense of moral obligationwhatsoever.  #1

Nobody, I can tell you that.And I really love the story on why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the part.Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh.And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie.Its just hilarious when they go fishing.And how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick.The movie is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times.But it can also be touching from time to time.You couldnt tell a story any better than it is told here.#1
10887_7#A horror movie is being shot and things arent going well. Its about a masked killer. The director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew. He goes crazy and kills two people. Hes killed himself and the film is never finished. Twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it--but theres a curse. People who try and finish it are killed themselves. The students ignore that. Guess what happens next? No great shakes but not bad at all. I give it a 7.#1
3497_3#Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this show doesnt compliment her at all.The character isnt even remotely likable and its not a situation where you think  oh shes such i b tch i love her  just  shes such a b tch .This character is just a plain old self righteous, mean, b tch.Sarah seems to struggle to have to carry this show because shes the only semi funny one in it.The mood, the dialogue its all so damn boring and dry its like listening to your grandpa go on and on about the marbles he collected as a kid. The Sarah Silverman Program is so unbelievably boring that i was thinking of changing the channel to watch old repeats of Married With children something that is funny because the characters are so  immoral  and  rude .Im sorry but i dont find a show packed with dry humour and corny off the wall story lines about some angry, bitter, losers angry, bitter life with her annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with a cold anywhere close to funny.I cant stand this show even though generally i find Sarah Silverman to be that  I love her cause shes such a b tch character  like in School Of Rock, and most of her stand up.I think this show is boring with characters who think being mean and saying and doing things for shock value eg. the constant pube, diarrhea and $hit in general for laughs.The Sarah Silverman program attempts to be funny and fails it either needs a laugh track or better writers.Someone compared it to South Park but its not even close.Ive expressed my opinions on The Sarah Silverman Program and wont become an annoying troll meaning you wont see me being a b tch and constantly posting stuff like  This show sucks  and  Why isnt this cancelled yet .I dont like The Sarah Silverman Program if you do enjoy.#0
1200_10#Have no illusions, this IS a morality story. Granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter, tempted back to the plains one more time by kill-crazed Taylor. Granger can see the end is near, and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt-on the herds, the Indians and the land itself. Taylor, on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo, or Indians to being with a woman. While Grangers role of the tortured hunter is superb, its Taylor who steals the show, as the demented, immoral everyman out for the fast buck and the goodtimes. Theres not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story moves along quickly, and we are treated to a fine character performance by Nolan. The theme of this story is just as poignant today, as in the 1800s-mans relationship to the land and whats on it, and racism. Considering when this was made, the Censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the bawdy house, Taylors relationship with the squaw, and much of the dialogue. Although downbeat, this is truly a great western picture.#1
8649_9#I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night. I do like Juliette Lewis although Im indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this viewing I have to admit hes a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable, and I didnt think  Brad Pitt  at all. If you like NBK you may well like this movie, and vice-versa.#1
4788_3#In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue chasing the Tall Man, assisted by a trigger-happy 9 year old, a black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mikes deceased brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in Phantasm II. I got the feeling the stress was merely laid on Reggies incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand-up comedian. The humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed, which fits a story like this better. Also, the settings arent as macabre here, plus the constant presence of the Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) isnt as obvious There still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time. By the way, beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off-screen. The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed 4 episodes so farthe fifth being in production. The first one is a semi-cult classic, the second is a horror-feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, even though James LeGros portrayed his character a lot better in Phantasm II.#0
11402_10#I saw  An American in Paris  on its first release when I was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway. I went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times I have seen it since, both in the cinema and on TV. It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The supporting cast of Oscar Levant (as quirky as ever), Georges Guetary (why didnt he make more movies ?) and Nina Foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. The closing ballet, superbly choreographed to the title music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are  Its Very Clear  (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and  I Got Rhythm  (the kids of Paris joining Gene Kelly in  Une Chanson Americaine ). If you love Paris, see this movie. If youve never been to Paris in your life, see it. But see it  #1

10537_10#This movie was very funny, I couldnt stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days! The movie is distinctively unique in its humor and visuals, both are terrific and on par with Natalis other (more serious) movie gems Cube and Cypher. I have become a huge Vincenzo Natali fan ever since watching Cypher and everything hes made is very interesting. All in all a great feel-good film about friendship. You have to see this #1
8234_7# Fido  is to be commended for taking a tired genre, zombies, and turning it into a most original film experience. The early 50s atmosphere is stunning, the acting terrific, and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning. Suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars,  Eisenhower era  dress, art deco furniture, and zombie servants. It would be very easy to dismiss  Fido  as cartoon-like fluff, similar to  Tank Girl , but the two movies are vastly different.  Fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior. Make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed. Highly recommended. - MERK#1
1156_9#Years ago I did follow a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie, and I was so rewarded for finding it. Its a marvelous spoof of soaps, with jealousies, the usual actors insecurities, and all sorts of lovely excesses. But more than anything - an amazing cast and an incredible script. How did someone get all those top-notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie? And how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines? I never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it, but its marvelous and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes Ill throw it on while doing housecleaning, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing. Many congrats to all who made it.#1
2723_7#IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, its also so bent on being realistic, its sometimes more clinical than entertaining. Recounting the brutal killing of a Midwest family, author Truman Capote focused on minutia, wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject AND subjects! Brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama. Although he films on actual locations, he keeps his distance. The murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles, which surely they were. Theyre not seen as misunderstood souls (as in the Capote book) and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as the reporter (the Capote  character? ) The landmark photography is by the great Conrad Hall.#1
2625_2#This film is horribly acted, written, directed and produced. But its so campy its actually semi-watchable. Thats SEMI watchable. Trivia It was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles N.east of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks/intersections/buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished  Oshawa Drive-in  just before it was torn down.#0
9470_8#Im not a Steve Carell fan however I like this movie about Dan, an advice columnist, who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brothers girlfriend. Its a story thats been told before, but not like this. There are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as the widower whos suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you. At times witty and wise in the way that an annoying Hallmark card can be, the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film. Worth a look see#1

4173_4#Man I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, taking on bad ass Vampires led by genre vet Michael Ironside.In Space. I mean I wasnt expecting high art, but It looked like a potential B movie classic. This was no doubt a TV pilot, reedited some time later into a feature film, after it wasnt picked up. Alright Ill start with the films few good points, the action was competent for a lower budgeted film, and the CGI and locations used were passable. Now onto the bad, first off Michael Ironside was barley in this, and his performance here.well it was cheesy not in a good way. But as I said he wasnt in it much anyways, so I cant blame him. One thing that was really stupid, was the PETA type group for Vampires, no Im not joking, its the dumbest most unbelievable thing Ive seen in along time, and its taken seriously. Also this film commits one of the major B movie sins, it teases a lesbian scene, and doesnt deliver. Most of all what sinks this film is nothing really happens. Since it was meant to be a pilot the script is almost nonexistent and it doesnt have a regular ending. Even the main villains, only come in towards the end. If ever a movie needed to up the Sleaze and gore factor, its Vampire Wars. In closing I will say the main crew on the spaceship, were all very capable actors and could very well put this mess behind them, and go on to bigger and better things. They just had nothing to work with here.#0
75_1#Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called `facts in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. This is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to TV. There isnt even one good word I can say about this film. Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here. When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!#0

1518_1#it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing. The first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go. You shouldnt really decide to watch this based on my review or not. I saw so little of it I shouldnt even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it. Couldnt they have just made Earnest does Dallas?#0
2312_9#A young man named Court is loved by everyone. His painful bloody death brings everyone closer. You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie. Whether predictable or not, and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs, this is a moving story, full of milieu and sensuality. One other thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didnt seem plausible. But the elements for this are set up subtly. Note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field. Note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves. He is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment. To this day, tractors are pretty dangerous.#1
10355_1#I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. And I have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching. Supposedly a movie had been made in the past, but Id never been able to locate it. Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline LEngles excellent book to the screen.  I have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make. I am still waiting for that movie. This one was A Wrinkle in Time in only the broadest of senses. Im going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the task #0
10719_2#I wouldnt say this totally sucked, but if it wasnt for Netflix I wouldnt even have this in my house. Steve Martins eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat. Hes just not funny. Hes another in a LONG slew of SNL rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next SNL movie. The birthing coach with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original. Amy Poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute SNL skit which is about as funny as SNL lately. The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes. The ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldnt get pregnant. The subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts, but it seems to simple simmer along, not really entertaining or creating laughs.#0
2246_10#A wonderful surprise of the Spanish cinema. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a great director, after all, I really dont care much for his choice in movies. However this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all something I ALWAYS enjoy! It hasnt enjoyed much good press and I really dont think itll ever be released in the US market. Well have to content ourselves with the DVD or VHS if even that I dont want to say much about the story because I dont want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it (like sooooooooooo many), before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on.#1
12384_1#If you havent seen this, its terrible. It is pure trash. I saw this about 17 years ago, and Im still screwed up from it.#0
10973_8#Excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies. They couldnt live together, nor apart. Babbling constantly, sometimes at the same time, they hashed and re-hashed the past; going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda. I found myself laughing at times, but mostly I was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were. See this one.#1
3855_2#The only redemption was the small part by Larry Miller. It seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be  Something About Mary,  but I didnt even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of her Cruel Intentions character. James Brolin was great, but Pauls father seemed like he was trying too hard to be the Randy Quaid character from the National Lampoons Vacation movies.#0
5283_3#I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas. Having reserved a special slot for it last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (aged 17 and a Film Studies student), with chocolates of course, in eager anticipation. We love Jane Austin. Sorry Jane.#0
1262_8#A young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is put on death row. Sean Connery plays the  happy go lucky  attorney whom the young mans grandmother tracks down out of retirement and pleads with to take on the case in the hopes of freeing her grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is hell bent on debunking an theory that Connery might dig up to try and free the boy whom he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee, and the Late Lynne Thigpen co-star in this very intense dramatic thriller.#1
4343_3#Im a big fan of Pacino movies. Hes one of, if not the best, actors of this genre. However, this movie couldve been a whole lot better even though it had a poor cast. All they had to do was tell the story of Carlito Brigante up until he went to jail. Instead it seemed like this was just one of many stories that could be told of Carlito. All or even some of the questions about his past that we wondered about in the original couldve been answered. As far as Im concerned, thats the only way you can make this movie. Instead we get this prequel that has almost NONE of the original characters in it, a character that plays a different part from the original (horrible move), and a totally different love interest for Carlito. Dont even get me started with Puffy. No way can I take that cat seriously as a gangsta after watching him dance in all his artists videos. Evertytime that dude opened his mouth I was waiting for him to start dancing. He made me laugh if anything. Mario Van Peeples surprised me with his role. I thought he was gonna give a lackluster performance due to his recent history. He did rather well. He was probably the most  believable  out of the entire cast in my opinion. Jay Hernandez did his best but doesnt have the skills right now in his career to take on this role. I appreciated his energy and his efforts though. Hard to follow up Pacino. The only way you could even have a clue about what kind of person Carlito was, is to watch the original. Otherwise, Carlito looks like a cold blooded killer in one scene then a spineless wimp in another. He was one of the baddest gangstas of his time but you would only see flashes of that in this movie. Maybe this is a pitiful way for Hollywood to try and make a 2nd prequel to cash in on this failure. Wouldnt surprise me. Overall, in my opinion, this movie fell well short or what it couldve been. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because I laughed a lot and Mario Van Peeples earned some respect back with me. A serious director shouldve taken this movie and actually put time into the story and turned it into an actual prequel. Im extremely disappointed that this movie wasnt taken seriously. They wouldve been better off making this into a mini-series on HBO and actually telling the story like the original suggests. At the end of the movie, they had the nerve to suggest that Carlito would have to come back to the city. HEEELLLLO.thats the part everyone wants to see  Then again, this is all just my opinion. I cant tell you how to waste your money.#0
12333_9#Joan Fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself. Her husband (Richard Ney) has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance, and they are reduced to living in a tiny room, with little or no prospects. They continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong. He is a charming, feckless, but wholly amiable fellow. However, Fontaine decides he has to go, as he has outlived his usefulness. So she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her, so that she can move on. She has meanwhile had a lover (Patric Knowles) whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either. She meets the aging Herbert Marshall, who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even Fontaine could figure out how to spend. She targets him and decides he will do nicely. He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty. He certainly isnt very exciting, and has about as much sex appeal as yesterdays omelette. But Fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money, and the man standing between her and it is transparent, so that she doesnt even notice or care what he looks like, she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it. She proceeds to poison her husband, and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily, so that everything is going well. But as always happens in the movies, and sometimes even in life, some unexpected things begin to go wrong, and the tension rises appreciably, so that Fontaine begins to sweat. Fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified, and as the net begins to close in on her, her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats. Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning. But she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover, who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up. He is condemned to death for murder, because the husbands death by poison came to light unexpectedly. But Sir Cedric Hardwicke, playing a grimly determined Scotland yard inspector, thinks there may be something amiss, and begins to doubt the story and suspect Fontaine. He closes in on her, and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic. But will the innocent mans life be saved before he is executed? Will Fontaine worm her way out of this one? Will Herbert Marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation? This film is expertly directed by Sam Wood, and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which I suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir.#1
686_9#Ghost Story (the TV Movie--1972) was the pilot for the NBC series. The movie was well-written and well-acted and, I thought, when the 1972-73 tv season started, if the tv series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner. (I wish this film was available on video ) The series was a colossal disappointment--even with William Castle as exec. producer. If, however,you have a chance to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You wont be disappointed.#1
6195_1#Badly made. Dreadful acting and an ending that the Director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull. Shocking that this film is considered for an award at the Gijón Film Festival. Everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as I - what was the point of even making the film? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly. I am astonished that this film has been given a release - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake. What a pity we did not have a Q and A at the end of the film - now that could have been interesting.#0
5636_10#In  Brave New Girl,  Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings  The Yellow Rose of Texas  at a local competition, and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia. From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace. The acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding, as well as Nick Roth The camera work was really done well and I was very pleased with the end (It seems a sequel could be in the making). Kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production. Quite a gem in the film archives.#1
11081_1#While the overall idea of Escape from Atlantis was intriguing, I found the film to be far less than what I had hoped for upon reading the plot summery. Perhaps I am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made, as it is now 2002, an official five years ago --after viewing fantasy epics such as Lord of the Rings, and science fiction feats like Star Wars, as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as Dinotopia or Homers The Odyssey. I do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design --that made it worth finishing to the end for me. Dont get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself, and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many, but I think that with a little more depth to the script, and a little more (I cannot believe I am saying this) realness I dare say Escape from Atlantis could have been magical.#0
4182_1#This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I am used to seeing the gray CGI blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. However, I had thought that I had seen all the possible lows that the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the third rate cast of Network TV rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves. Why does almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying, abrasive, crude, or just totally unsympathetic? I found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win.#0
10960_1#Ouch! They dont come much worse than this horrid adaptation of C. S. Lewiss beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel, the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. Ive read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the BBC has ever given at the time, but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the $2 that it looks like this was filmed for. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects werent at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time, but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid. Better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role! Avoid this at all costs.#0
12129_7#This is a well directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of The Prsoner of Zenda. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan. In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well. Worth watching despite Ms Davis vocal gymnastics.#1
7432_4#One of the weaker Carry On adventures sees Sid James as the head of a crime gang stealing contraceptive pills. The fourth of the series to be hospital-based, its possibly the least of the genre. Theres a curiously flat feel throughout, with all seemingly squandered on below-par material. This is far from the late-70s nadir, but Williams, James, Bresslaw, Maynard et al. are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability. Carry On Matron is not a bad film by any means, just a crushingly bog-standard one.#0
1_1#Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog is unbelievable. Jane Fondas character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snails pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what? Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesnt require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.#0
6786_10#Ronald Colman gives an electrifying performance as Tony John, a Broadway actor who cant separate his offstage life from Shakespeares Othello, the character he plays on stage.Two important scenes illustrate Tonys dilemma. The first one takes place in producer Max Laskers office. Acting is a matter of talent for the practical-minded Lasker. But Donlan, Tonys friend, disagrees  No, no. When you do it like Tony does it, its much more. The way he has of becoming someone else every nightso completely. No, dont tell me his whole system isnt affected by it. .The other scene occurs in waitress Pat Krolls apartment. Tony tells her his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he says  Or Paul. Hamlet. Joe. And maybe Othello. .When Tony begins rehearsing Othello, we learn that though hes trying to keep his real life separated from his stage life,  The part begins to seep into your life, and the battle begins. Reality against imagination.  He cant keep the two separated In his mind Pat is Desdemona and hes Othello, and he wrongly believes she has been unfaithful to him. He murders her.Colmans bravura performance, in a complex and difficult role, earned him 1947s Academy Award for Best Actor. Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for Best Original Screenplay. Not to be overlooked is Milton Krasners atomspheric cinematography.#1
11354_1#I, also having endured hundreds of childrens movies in the past, consider this to be one of the worst I have ever seen. In all its just crude, badly animated, even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view.#0
7076_3#Race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till youve driven 150, and 150 mph seems fast till youve driven 250. Whats really startling is that somebody gave him a LOT of money to make Alabamas Ghost. Theres sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow that makes Alabamas Ghost SO WRONG. You watch some awful cheeseball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their Discover cards. But Alabamas Ghost was made with an actual budget, and thats EVIL. I mean, Ive got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the woods out of Twizzlers, and nobodys beating down MY door waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for FOUR of the flakiest movies ever made?#0
10550_4#After being a big fan of the ten minute T.V episodes of Stella Street, I awaited this film with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately I was left feeling very disappointed. If you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street, you may find this film entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated. 4/10#0
10161_2#I really didnt expect much from this film seeing as it has people from Parkersburg WV, which is were I live, acting in it. This town is dull and so is this film. There were a few decent scened in the movie but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show. This movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasnt any. Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday, then stay away from this movie. The dialog will put you to sleep, the acting will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this. Its a predictable movie with no surprises. What you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.#0
510_8#I just watched this for the first time in a long time - I had forgotten both how imaginative the images were, and how witty the movie is. I had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are (with the scene at the Candlelight Club in Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic ever filmed. #1
3532_1#Its like if you took the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave  im intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of  film maker rubbish, mashed in a few extra styles for good measure, chopped off the ending, there you have Revolver. Up there as the worst Movie I have ever seen, with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little.#0
6380_9#Atlantis The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slow, but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the fabled Atlantis. Along with friends of his grandfather, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own. Along the way, he must endear friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. The voice cast is great. They surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent. The music is nothing special but likable anyway. The animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.#1
6013_1#Ive read every book to date in the left behind series, and the movie hardly does any of them justice. Sure, Ive seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good MST3K episode. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt like the actors were reading their lines, instead of actually saying them. The characters were stiff and unlikeable. The effects were cheesy, and looked terribly fake. The ending was awful. First of all, it didnt even go all the way through the first book. Second, it made no sense. If you hadnt read the book, youd have no idea what was going on. It had to have been the most cheesy, film student-like ending Ive ever seen in a movie. Im upset that I actually paid money for this movie. If by some miracle, it does get wide release, they ought to totally overhaul it and let Hollywood take over. Those two wannabe film producers, and the wannabe director should leave movie making to the professionals.#0
7157_4#1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda) Weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughters body. At least I think that was the relationship. A kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike Stephen Kings The Shining. The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholsons performance that isnt at all in this film. This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at litening up the mood dont work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything doesnt seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing in an attempt to sell the film. Dont buy into this gimmick and avoid this film. #0
5171_10#If I could go back, even as an adult and relive the days of my Summers spent at campI would be there so fast. The Camps I went to werent even this great. They were in Texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing. The movie cinematography was astounding, the characters funny and believable especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimis character and sub-antics were priceless. So who ever thought this movie was lameI have deep pity for because they cant suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids. The whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity. I wish I could. It was funny, intelligent, beautifully scripted, brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so I want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even. Sorta like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawkgood movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors. Rent it, see it, buy it and watch it over and over and overnever gets old. ;0)#1
975_9#Also known as the Big Spook War. The Great Yokai War is Miikes attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well. The problem is that I cant imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie. The best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery, Neverending Story and Return to Oz spring to mind, but in the case of the Great Yokai War Miike probably takes things a little too far. In fact at the screening I was at the person introducing the movie reiterated to the two families there that it was probably not very suitable. Well worth a watch just for the occasional flash of Gogo arse.#1
1657_9#And that goes especially for lawyers & cops. Puerto Rico,which boasts of a small,but potent film production firm,brings this multi layered tale of corruption,due to the on going drug cartel that starts in South America,makes a pit stop on the island commonwealth,and then northbound into North America. Steven Bauer,the most recognizable face on screen here,leads a cast of top notch actors,in a story of  can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd? . Ricardo Mendez Matta moves up from directing mainly action adventure fare for American television,in a screenplay written by Matta,along with Poli Marichal.

Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles. Rated R by the MPAA,this film contains outbursts of vulgar language,brief flashes of nudity,adult content & violence,some of which is quite lurid.#1
2028_10#Burlinson and Thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie, along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love, it really goes down deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this movie, placing among one of the best I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic  Any horse-lovers out there will love this movie! #1
9405_1#I just finished watching this on TV and what can I say but this is the worst film I have EVER seen! Im embarrassed to be from Melbourne, where the film was made. Diabolical acting, amateurish makeup effects and a REALLY bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, thats even MORE stupid! Some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was. Theres a reason they put these types of films on late night TV - because theyre utter rubbish! Avoid at all costs.#0
7691_2#Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley. Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was not an upward career move.#0
8007_1#I really, really didnt expect this type of a film outside of America. How anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a  thriller  is just sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously admired) going around like some sort of child-saving Rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world. Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? HmmI wonder. If they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button-pushing crap. 1/10#0
7422_10#As a long-standing Barbra fan, any posting like this will be biased. That aside, this film ranks as a classic. It has its flaws (emphasized in other postings), but gives a glimpse of a time (late 70s) that will never be there again, and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen. #1

7895_10#In the opening scenes of this movie a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another mans bathroom and blew out all the lights. This must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film, Robin Hood did not make an appearance as far as I could see. However, Bette Davis(Daisey Appleby), The Whales of August ,87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so called swim suit on her yacht with George Brent(Johnny Jones), The Spiral Staircase ,46. Daisey even proposed marriage to Johnny in a Ferris Wheel upside down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a great couple, one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter. Off stage, Davis and Brent were having a real torrid love affair, which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the film for you #1
10341_1#I rented this movie from the library (its hard to find for good reason) purely out of curiosity. Im a huge Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies Ive ever seen. The script is horrible, not because it strays from the original novel text, but because it strays without focus or intent. The scenes are ill-constructed and dont lead the viewer anywhere. Whats with the hokey voice over of Plaths poetry? Lady Lazarus has little do with Greenwoods situation; Plaths poetry was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is completely unbelievable as Esther Greenwood (or any 20 year old for that matter) partly due to casting (she was 32 during filming, the age Plath was when she DIED) and partly due to the fact that she cant act. Hassett is all emotion, no craft, no skill. The direction is mediocre; the director simply covers whats there, which isnt much. The only reason Im giving the film a 1 is because 0 isnt an option. Sorry Sylvia, youll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting.#0
7680_4#Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too exaggerated. Anyway, the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions.  I also think the topic of  young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives  is a wide spread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be elaborated with more care. I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White, in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills.#0

7650_9#Wow, I loved this film. It may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch. The tale revolves around this one family from Utah and its the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch. The main lead (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his part very well, at no time does he leave you to believe that hes acting all his feelings. Its his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me though. When the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other, giving fantastic performances. Great cast, great film.#1

Let me start by saying Ive just come direct from viewing this movie, and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and I dont think theyll be moving any time soon. Whether you enjoy it or not, Its one you wont forget in a hurry.#1
11217_7#Being an otaku since the days of Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film. Although it has been described as being  sappy,  it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do. Since the main character is a female, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to  macho-man  tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers. The seiryuu for Noriko, incidentally, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is as 3-dimensional a cartoon can get; her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious  Homing Laser  and  Buster Shield  (which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true Dracula style) technique. I doubt that scene was meant to be funny, but it cracked me up. Yet all in all, I would rank Gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time.#1
469_2#Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for itbut obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers-that-be disowned this waste of celluloidthe editing is el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupidand the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shotI never thought I would feel sorry for Ralph Macchio making the decision to be in this thing, but I doand I REALLY feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece offilmat least Mr. Leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movieand he comes out aheadthere are actually copies of this thing with Mads beginning sequence still on itif you can locate one, grab it cuz it is probably worth somethingits the only thing about this movie thats worth anythingand a note to the folks at IMDb.comthere is no way to spoil this movie for anyonethe makers spoiled it by themselves#0
12047_1#I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to  Fabio on the beach  in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter OToole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesnt even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I wouldnt recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right).#0
9672_7#I know, I know its childish. But I just love this type of movie. A bird that suffered a lot of  mishaps  and still hasnt lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor. Whats special about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie -the parrot- and hes not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor. Furthermore I like the storyline Paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom. (By the way Jay Mohrs voice almost sounds like Joe Pescis!). And Cheech Marin of course, the man IS humor to me. Ever since I saw  Up in Smoke  I have appreciated his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a hilarious one.. cant help myself.#1
8553_7#i just watched the movie i was afraid its gonna disappoint me. i was rather surprised at the end though. The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times. yes, it wont be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones. beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had.it is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did. but what the hell-it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. beta house deserves 6/10 but i gave it 7/10 just for being another slice of PIE.#1
7564_1#The Wicker Man. I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie. Grrrr!#0
1502_10#The late, great Robert Bloch (author of PSYCHO, for those of you who werent paying attention) scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies I ever saw as a kid. (I had to walk MILES just to see a movie, and it was usually dark when I emerged from the theater; seeing a horror movie was always unnerving, but particularly so when it was as well-executed as this one.) When I had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on videotape (which should always be a last resort), I was surprised at how well it held up. Take the terror test watch it at night, alone, and THEN tell me its not scary#1
7046_2#I saw this dull waste of time on HBOs Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue Ive come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but thats about it. This is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around.#0
10659_2#Filmatography Excellent, nice camera angles (I dont remember seeing a movie of late, with good close-ups, until this one). Could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera. NY is pictured good.I liked the upside down angles, in particular (a different touch). Thx#0
1087_10#There is so much to love in this darling little comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled Mr. Blanding.Melvyn Douglas,with great comedic flare, both narrates and acts as the Blandings attorney and voice of reason.As well Myrna Loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is Grants. He is the American everyman, especially relevant at the time of this films release, when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war. The themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity.Yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending. It is still relevant today, and I must chalk up the poor reviews I see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies. The look of the film is slick, and there are some great bits of comedy is well, particularly toward the beginning.While it may have lost some of its social relevance, nearly sixty years after its release, it is still a gem.#1
2582_2#Just finished watching American Pie Beta House and I gotta say, this was such a garbage pile of crap. The first 3 American Pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. As you figured out from the title of the movie, Beta House, is about a fraternity, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of them all, falling in love. Of course, the guy that has his way with the chicks is Stifler, who, along with his mates, tries to complete another apparently impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. Its just really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) To sum it up awful acting + dull script + wrong use of the American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This movie is unbearable. I give it a two out of ten, although most of it sucked there were lots of nudity and pretty girls, like 2 funny scenes )#0
7728_7#THE JIST See something else. This is a difficult movie to take on -- I suggest you dont accept the challenge.#1
10104_1#I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a total piece of crap. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but thats not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever. Absolutely WORTHLESS.#0
878_3#I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant  A Double Life  and the funny  Born Yesterday  and co-wrote such excellent screenplays as  Adams Rib  and  Pat And Mike  with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome, sad drivel as  Bachelor Mother ,  Some Kind Of A Nut , and this. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The script sinks to its nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which Janssens character tests Drivass character to make sure hes not gay. An ugly sequence, but sadly one which could easily play in a film today.  Ethnic  jokes are now totally verboten, but  fag  jokes are still  good, clean, family fun .#0
8081_9#Brilliant movie. The drawings were just amazing. Too bad it ended before it begun. I ve waited 21 years for a sequel, but nooooo #1
1640_10# Heartland  is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier. The hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers. The drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful. She is an example of the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land.#1
8577_8#I think Hollow Point is a funny film with some good moments I have never seen before in action movies. Well,both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith arent so good in acting, but Tia Carrere is nice and good looking girl, isnt it? But Donald Sutherland is superb in his role so-so mad gangster.#1
3174_9#Very rarely does one come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The writer director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work, but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate. The script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer, but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you cant help but commit to Ernie as a character. Very funny stuff. Despite the tiny budget Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look. Hes not messing around when it comes to making a good movie. I cant wait to see what he comes up with next. This guy can make people laugh and think; thats special.#1
11406_1#But I got over it. To me, it seemed that even the Author of the book favored Caroline. I felt so sorry for the character Louise, and she was constantly compared with Esau who was evil, I just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un-realistic. Really though, the movie was bad. I wouldnt really see it unless youre ready for a big let down.#0
10276_10#Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama. All the compositional devices Bach perfected to keep his listener (and the performer) intrigued and entertained applies to this film. There isnt a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene I feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad. Mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but I feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders I wonder how this work would have ended? As it exists it is very somber and mean spirited.#1
4146_10#Anyone who lived through the ages of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this film. It is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a  spring break movie  PLUS it makes fun of the college film genre. Its funny, its got a cast to die for (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch!, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Writer/ actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (Im just repeating myself now) It will live on with girls who like Miranda July but feel like eating ice cream and pretending theyre dumb.#1
2938_3#By my  Kool-Aid drinkers  remark, I mean that these are such devoted fans of the man Pavarotti that they make no attempt to objectively rate this film. Giving this a 10 is akin to giving Wally Cox the award for Mr. Universe or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre  When this film debuted, I remember the savage reviews with headlines such as  No, Giorgio  and some said it was among the worst films ever made. This is definitely overstating it as well. While bad and far from a great work of art, there was a lot to like about the film and the movies biggest deficit was not the acting of Pavarotti nor his girth. Sadly, from what I have read, this film might be a case of art imitating life, as Pavarottis own life later had some parallels to this film, though this isnt exactly the forum to discuss this in detail.#0
3307_3#My comments may be a bit of a spoiler, for what its worth. Stop now if you care enough. Saving Grace should have been titled  A Paper-Thin Excuse for Old British Women to Get High On-Screen.  This film is dumb. The incidental music is an annoyance as are the obvious, hackneyed tunes that sporadically pop up to comment on the narrative ( Spirit in the Sky,  for example - Oh, I get it!) This is basically a Cheech and Chong movie made credible by its stodgy English setting and Brenda Blethyns overwhelming power to inflict emotion on an audience using her voice alone. I could literally hear the folks over at High Times magazine receiving their jollies over the enormous  buds  that litter this picture. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda attempts to peddle her illicit wares on the street of London in a blaring white dress-suit. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. Not a good movie. The 7.2 rating is the result of zealots over-voting. Dont waste your time#0
2138_4#War, Inc. - Corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their wet-work against rival CEOs. A dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike. It was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on. I kept waiting for things to make sense. Theres no reason or method to the madness. Its not a terrible movie, but in the end you gotta ask  War, what is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. C-#0
10742_1#i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago.what a disaster .the acting was atrocious.there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon.this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didnt ring true.supposedly a modern reworking of the Hitchcock original  Lifeboat .i think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it.from what i was able to suffer through,there is nothing compelling in this movie.it boasts a few semi big names,but they put no effort into their characters.but,you know,to be fair,it was nobodys fault really.i mean,im pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion. LOL.it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along.but for me,im not willing to spend at least three days to find out.so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon,avoid this stinker/ 1/10#0
3653_10#Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this commonplace movie???  The cast gives some good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a girl without mother and Justin Whalin, a guy eternally lessened by his bother), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can NOT believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer) are you CRAZY??? #1
8642_8#A surprisingly effective thriller, this. Intelligent, sinister and beautifully shot, this deserves recognition beyond its current status. A top movie.#1
7846_10#Im usually not too into a specific show (save for The O.C. & Desperate Housewiveshey, I am 20!), but, no kidding, after one episode of Reunion I was hooked. The one episode for each year idea is wonderful, in my opinion. The only other show I can recall doing something similar is 24, with each episode being an hourand having an eventful year is more realistic than a day that eventful! Please give this show a shot. Relax about art formits just TV!#1
7861_10#Uneducated & defiant, beautiful TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on a rich mans land. Spirited & bold, she captures the heart of the millionaires son, but violence, terror & sudden death are what will haunt her immediate future before she can claim the sweet peace of happiness. A splendid new orchestral score for TESS has been supplied by Jeffrey Mark Silverman which perfectly underscores the beauty & pathos of this wonderful film.#1
1791_2#Whats with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie? Its like someone put muddy water on the camera lens. The acting by the Van Helsing character and bad girl  Rally  isnt bad. I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little. Wicked martial arts! Dont take it too seriously and youll enjoy it.#0
584_8#Excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years. Starting around 1910, he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood; his family, friends, romances, etc. Very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale. all things in life come together as one, and a river runs through it. And that river haunts me.  Worth seeing.#1
3182_1#Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then hes off to Malta where he shoots more people. He gets locked up many times for shooting people. Then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy, who is dressed like a monk. There is a boat chase, and Joe Don winds up in jail again. Finally Joe Don, with the help from Elaine from  Seinfeld  kill the bad guy, blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare. All this and a catchy theme song, just like Mitchell #0
10454_1#when discussing a movie titled snakes on a plane, we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot. expect to see this movie for sale in the DVD bargain section for £1 in 6 months time. and if youre expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes, and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips. forget it.#0
9417_10#An unassuming, subtle and lean film,  The Man in the White Suit  is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from Ealing studios. While I suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure, I doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot, the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the films course. Rating-      1/2/     #1
2343_4#What we have here is a classic case of TOO much patriotism. This is what happens when you live in a small country with very little (next to none, even) cinema history. Whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families or long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries borders. This is especially the case when the writer/director of this particular film is already a nations sweetheart, because hes also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band.  Any Way The Wind Blows  is by no means a bad film, but its definitely overrated (if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country) and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer. This is basically the Flemish version of classic movies such as  Short Cuts  and  Magnolia  and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end. The only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists at first is the city of Antwerp, where they all live and work, but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party. The main problem with  Any Way The Wind Blows , at least according to yours truly, lies with the characters. They really are random, uninteresting and honestly dont experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary. It was presumably writer/director Tom Barmans intention to depict the average & regular inhabitant of Antwerp but then, seriously, what is the point? One of the characters gets fired from his film projectionist job, another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis, two siblings recently lost their father and the most  mysterious  one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes. There are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen, but theyre even less worth mentioning. These people simply drivel on and on about very random topics (like life in the 80s, dates and each others bowel motions) and philosophy about matters nobody cares about. Some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles, especially the interactions between the two twenty-something guys from Ghent, but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable. The film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of Antwerp and as an extended & versatile music documentary. There are several stylish & nifty sightseeing images of Antwerp and theres always beautiful music playing, whether really loud or subtly in the background. Generally speaking  Any Way The Wind Blows  is a competently made and stylish effort, but too mundane and slightly boring, and I honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it werent a Flemish production.#0
7089_9#Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films of the Sci-fi genre and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality. An apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound, 12 MONKEYS never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout. Excellent use of Philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place. RATING 9 of 10#1
9891_10#I first rented this film many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it. Just recently, feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that Ive immensely enjoyed in my lifetime, I decided to give  Erendira  another look. And Im glad I did, as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film. This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which, upon drinking, is immensely satisfying, however, you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there arent more bottles just like this one.#1
4400_10#The star of this film is the screenplay. Attention to detail for the period in dress, language ,social mores ( we dont hurt women) and the politics are remarkable. It is a reminder of Kosovo to-day. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. Perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received. It is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step. A great film.#1
133_10#A few years ago, a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the Michael Mann film Heat on it. After we finished that movie, and were about to stand up, we saw that there is another film just after, tough on the cassettes envelope the owner didnt write it up. Yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits. However, the Werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers. They feared the Werewolf everywhere, suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas main exploded in the police HQ of bombed-out Bremen, or when the Soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in Berlin. The effect was strongest on the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (in large part children!) preemptively on suspicion of being Werewolf, and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died.#1
9212_9#Yesterday, I went alone to the cinema, because here in Mexico, most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called  camára alternativa  (alternative camera). But after I saw this movie, I realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative. Afortunately, this is a good a example. But I have to said that I enjoyed so much this movie.. that at the end I was happy.. this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days. And the main lesson for me.. is that at the end of the daythe love is main force behind us. This is a good option to see a good movie in Spanishand I have to mention the good music.. specially the main song of the movie.. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena. Excellent song #1
10611_1#Terrible acting by Potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever. And as for the feminist polemic, its laughable. I saw this garbage when it was first released and though I found it tedious beyond belief Im glad I did go to see it. Thats because I now have an immediate answer to the question whats the worst film youve ever seen? Plus, I have the comfort of knowing that every film I see for the rest of my life will be better than The Tango Lesson. But I have to admit I was impressed with the way Potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world (as is revealed in the closing credits). I only very recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film. All it took was a bunch of frilly costumes, a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady, and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public. So why shouldnt she think she could get away with the self-indulgent nothingness that is The Tango Lesson?#0
2290_4#The ultimate goal of Big Brother, that we know what to think before we think it, has been realized. Is it some kind of miracle, or sinister joke, that people don mental straight jackets of their own volition, twist themselves into contorted shapes, and grin like apes? Movies, art, no longer risk the unknown, but are forgone conclusions, drained of life. Like hell Harron doesnt  make feminist films,  doesnt  make anything ideological.  Ideology has become so internalized, so assumed, so programmed, that its almost invisible. Big Brother must be smiling.#0
7198_1#After Disneys witty live-action George of the Jungle, I had high hopes for this flick. Major disappointment. Thread bare plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. This film relied on lame one-liners, idiotic ( and pointless) product placement, and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing. I took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind. The only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin!#0
7144_2#It was almost worth sitting through this entire god-awful  film  just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as this again. Acting - 0, script - 0, fight scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is gorgeous and not a terrible actress). This is the criteria I used to average it out to a two. I lost count but I believe ever movie cliché, ever, is in this movie. When the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her, from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement. Plus he just shows up for no reason. He was never even mentioned before. I dont know what else to say here. Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple years. At least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials.#0
3093_2#Whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the MST3K version, you can only be impressed by the utter GALL that went into this production. The filmmakers insult the viewers intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldnt care less that they are doing so. And the hobgoblins? At the end they all head back to the vault where theyve lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film-making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script, incompetent direction, actors who are so bad theyd be rejected from a high school theater production, and sets worthy of Edward D. Wood, Jr.#0
4595_10#Jackie Chan name is synonomus to stunts. This movie never let you down.The opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder ,if he knows the meaning of fear.This movie comes very close to Jackies best which is PROJECT A.But the main difference being that PROJECT A contains three stars where as in this movie Jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders.This is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee.The film has nice comic touches too. What makes this film work is Jakies ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero.This movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor.#1
9252_10#I have seen this film on countless occasions, and thoroughly enjoyed it each time. This is mostly due to the lovely Erika Eleniak- a great actress with incredible looks. Plus, any film starring Tom Berenger and Dennis Hopper is bound to be entertaining.#1
2403_1#Whack  I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end. Other than that I was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time. Some teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his Dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if theres a full moon. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years past but he doesnt age a bit and enrolls in a high school. There he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her. This movie sucked and I dont recommend it to anyone. Read War and Peace instead. Only Ms. Hartman did a great job. Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one #0
12346_10#This is a very fine and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Magnificent music score. Ive been twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The movement of the camera is superb, as well as the actors. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and its all very well brought onto the screen here. The director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. Once youve seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director. Its a real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everybody.#1
6650_3#I think this would have been a much better film if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light. My family is from the southeast region of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard the people I grew up around talk like these folks did. The Cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks. Most of the Cajuns I know are well educated, proud people and dont sound uneducated at all when they talk the way these people did. All in all it was an OK movie, with great scenery and music. I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles, and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, please have the actors study the language, live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, its a much more enjoyable movie!#0
9920_7#This is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a Canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man. It begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things, parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it isnt really made very clear. The emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how theyre herded around outside in little yellow jackets. The film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory, and talking with his crew as he does so. This is a world of relentless industrialization. Its a relief at least to know these soulless images arent going to be presented without a human voice, as is the case in Nikolaus Geyrhalters gleefully cold documentary about the food industry, Our Daily Bread. Manufactured Landscapes contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town (many towns, really) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever, with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is. Some of these scenes, the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places, might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer Sebastião Salgado. But this photographer isnt as interested in seeing people up close. His orientation places him somewhere in between Salgado and the cold, neutral modern landscape photographs of Lewis Baltz. Because of the limitations of the narration, the idea of the title Manufactured Landscapes feels insufficiently developed. It even seems a misnomer. New landscapes they are, but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than  manufactured.  Landscapes of Waste or Wasted Landscapes might be better titles. There is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about Edward Burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions.#1
11935_2#Billy Chung Siu Hungs (the bloody swordplay film Assassin from 1993) film Love To Kill (Hong Kong, 1993) is among the strongest products of the Category III boom that inhabited the HK cinema in early nineties. It consisted of films with strong sex, nudity and violence, more or less gratuitous and shock valued only. Love To Kill definitely belongs to the  more  category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness. Love to Kill earns no more than 2/10 from me as I dont have too high appreciation on films like this. (HK) Cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like Love to Kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art.#0
4638_10#I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. my Hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles were very useful, I didnt feel lost at any point in the movie. You tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. This movie blew me away  It depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today A homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously. The dilemma, the emotions entailed. The movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side! an absolute must see #1
3637_1#I am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film. Unless you have an academic interest in the period I strongly suggest steering clear of this one.#0
2051_8#Ah, McBain The character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by  The Simpsons  but it will also always  to me personally, at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90s action flick; directed by the cool dude who brought us  The Exterminator  and starring two of the most ultimately badass B-movie heroes Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside (the latter with a cute little macho ponytail). I guess  McBain  will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure, because theres no way I can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture. The film is unimaginably preposterous (most action heroes take on a small gangster posse  McBain takes on an entire country) and yet takes itself way too seriously. The script is a non-stop and incoherent spitfire of clichéd situations, nonsensical twists, compulsory sentimental interludes, grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings. Its a totally delirious movie; I loved it.  Okay, lets not fool each other here. The fact youre reading a user- comment on  McBain  already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low-budget B-movie action. One of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of  McBain . This list is totally accurate and I can only concur with it. Heck, I could even add some more senseless sequences to that list (like the preposterous and needless heroic self- sacrifice of a soldier who doesnt even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of McBains squad), but whats the point? You definitely know not to expect a 100% coherent and plausible masterpiece. We know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie, and its maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out! This is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former Vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt Columbian president and the national drug cartel. Please dont expect another  Apocalypse Now . This particular motion picture relies on the ruff n tuff acting performances of the macho leads, a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which Joan Baez sings a cover of  Brothers in Arms .#1
9396_3#The Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950s serials. The special effects are pretty cheap, the lunar rovers are obviously World War II surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them, and the like. The acting is only so-so. It does inspire the imagination of children, to whom I believe this was directed to. By todays standards, its boring, cheap, and bad. Theres also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.#0
10071_9#When tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir, the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as  The King of Masks,  becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate. The technical transfer itself is not that great, as I found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended -) 9/10 stars.#1
2064_8#The ScareCrow was on of the funniest Killers I have ever seen in the act! Plus hes really bouncy most of the time he jumped around, which was awesome! Also he had an excellent voice I mean it was just perfect for him. The story lines was excellent too. I like how the kids soul was transferred into ScareCrow that was cool! Plus he did have a reason for all that killing I mean after what those people did to him..I would be angry too! ScareCrows look was really good! his look gives that person an  OMG!  reaction when they see him! Which was great the stares he got were funny! Those people were stupid, who would stare for that long! They should of glanced and ran for their liveseven though that wouldnt of made a difference #1
11638_4# Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned  is the third installment of the Gabriel Knight games, a series of adventure games about the roguish writer/paranormal detective, Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his companion, Grace, have been asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so-called  night visitors.  When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel pursues the night visitors to Rennes le Château, where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the Holy Grail. All in all, the game was a disappointing installment in the series, despite an improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight.#0
2389_10#I work with children from 0  6 years old and they all love the Doodlebops. The Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and appealing. Once they start singing,  Were the Doodlebops Were the Doodlebops Were the Doodlebops Oh yeah Come and join the fun because were laughing and were singing all day  it is almost impossible not to join them in song. The Doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun. Each show is an adventure, the Doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to. The Doodlebops is an refreshing, high action alternative to regular childrens television programs.#1
8408_10# It wasnt me! It was, er, my twin brother Rupert!  Bobby says to Dugan when confronted about being over at Sallys place. I have used this line dozens of times over the years (no one has yet to believe it, though).  Nobody calls Dugan a turd!  is another line for the ages. This classic film was definitely worth the price of admission.#1
6136_2#Bucks role as The Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker (of The Price is right) running a country the same way he runs his show. But theres lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey. Kurt Thomas as the baby-faced  hero  displays some considerable acrobatic skills, but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever. Theres a few spooky moments (in the Village of Crazies, mostly), and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences. But any given  Ninja  movie will give you much more entertainment, and you wont feel as guilty about laughing.#0
2171_10#A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Wonder if this film is already out in DVD, because it must be seen in Widescreen version. Saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since then forgot it.I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances.The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.#1
2989_10#First off, I would just like to say what a big fan of Bette Midlers I am. Stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite films of all time. It deals with a mother raising a child on her own, she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter Jenny played wonderfully by Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave is 3 1/2 stars! And it deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I give it 4 out of 4!#1
6035_1#I really wish i could give this a negative vote, because i think i just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film. the acting was just god awful, i mean REALLLYYYY bad, the dialog was worse, the script sounded like it was written by. i cant think of anything horrible enough to say. And the day  outside  and the night  inside  shots make you think the events took over several days. Terribly acted, directed, written, etc etc. all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS. If my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed, it is to tell the world to not watch this crap. This movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.#0
4446_3# Serum  starts out with credits that are quite reminiscent of the  Re-animator  movies, and it owes a lot to them. The story is very similar; a mad doctor develops a serum that he believes will alleviate pain, sickness and death, but hes apparently not a big believer in clinical trials and so winds up with a brain-eating zombie on his hands in the person of his nephew. The zombie even looks like one of those from  Re-animator,  and in fact some of the make-up effects in  Serum  arent bad. Unfortunately, the script is pretty slow and unbelievable in quite a few places, resulting in a soap opera feel for most of the first 3/4 of the movie. For some reason, the director feels compelled to tell us the time of day every few minutes by flashing it in big white letters across the screen. I cant see why this was important, other than being an attempt to provide viewers with a sense of time passing; sometimes, that wouldnt be present otherwise as the plot plods along.  Serum  is better in some ways than much of what goes straight-to-video as independent horror lately. In terms of technical items  sound and photography, for example  its got a more polished look than a lot of what lands on a DVD. On the other hand, theres still a good deal of wooden acting (particularly by one of the lead characters, the mad scientist himself!) and nonsensical moments that have nothing to do with suspension of disbelief and everything to do with writing and continuity. Maybe these are things that the people involved with making this film will eventually get more experience with, though. One of the problems with low-budget independent horror lately is that the filmmakers often set out to remake more popular movies that had bigger budgets, and that almost never works out. It didnt in the case of  Serum,  anyhow.#0
9807_10#I remember this series so well. It was excellent - such strong and compelling characters, stylish and sexy  and so different to everything else on offer at the time - and now  I am sure that it inspired the also excellent Canadian drama  Traders .  Sometimes you can get it on special at Amazon.co.uk#1
2400_7#I do see what my forebears saw in the youthful Bette Davis. Shes splendid throughout this almost-madcap political comedy which actually stars Warren Williams as the political operative constantly behind on his alimony. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as his ex, and I found myself rooting for her throughout. The Williams character is not at all sympathetic, and hes not even a decent op. Yes, both my wife and I recommend this one.#1
2112_9#In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with co-worker James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two dont get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal. Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying.

2874_10#Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. One day, a ball is to be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance of going, because her stepmother and stepsisters wont let her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is off to the ball, with the warning to return home by midnight. At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving behind one of her glass slippers. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince later get married, and they live happily ever after. Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success, and it continues to charm audiences to this day. It has a well-written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including  A Dream is A Wish Your Heart Makes ,  So This Is Love , and the great  Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo , help tell the story. This was my favorite movie growing up, and it hasnt lost any of its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD release is the best way to appreciate this film, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music video, vintage radio programs, and a restored print of the movie #1
9892_1#Why is it that any film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making? Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all, Julius Ceasar, and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors. Despite lavish sets and costumes, this movie is as bad as any Italian  sandals and toga  extravaganza of the 50s. Admittedly, this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen, which is why  Gladiator  went over well, but  Gladiator  did not have all the romance novel sex. Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Pity some of it didnt wash off on the others.#0
11769_1#Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And Ill start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow. It is to Edward Nortons credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film.#0
5709_10#Made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often. So when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost, through no fault of his own, he is frantic. Everyone is out for themselves, looking for this ticket, in something like a precursor to  The Great Race.  Even though this is all a flashback, I was in knots the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this all-for-me show-me-the-money cash-in-the-bank film. Watch Le Million today #1
6839_10#In what must be one of the most blood-freezing movies ever, a transvestite is murdering people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. One can see how Brian DePalma takes some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and stuff. Michael Caine plays a most thought-provoking character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo. Keith Gordon (who later starred in  Christine ) is probably the most interesting character in the movie. But you cant really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it, you may never know just whom you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.#1
9263_1#What was the deal with the clothes? They were all dressed like something out of the late 70s early 80s. The cars were even were outdated. The school was outdated. The nuns attire was outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 40s, with its wards and wooden staircases and things. Nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991. My mother was laughing, saying  Geeeee-od! WHEN was this movie MADE?  When we pressed the  INFO BUTTON  on our remote, we were sure 1991 had to be typo! Did anybody else notice this? My FAVORITE part, though, was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband, on the telephone, about the inverted cross in the mirror, and he just says  Well, look, Ive got a congress meeting. Ill talk to you about it later.  That line was just classic. JUST LIKE A MAN! My mothers favorite part was when they gave the  Spawn of the Devil Child  her very own Rottweiler. My mother said  Just what the Spawn of the Devil needs a Rottweiler  She also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches, clutching their chests. Her OTHER favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot, driving 5 miles a hour, driving right into the garbage truck/dump truck/front end loader thingee. He had about 20 seconds to just stop the carbut he just kept going, with a real dumb vacant look on his face. I mean, how fast can you GO in a school parking lot?!?! Whatever #0
1728_7#The Wooden Horse was one of the first  great  escape stories from World War II, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October of 1943. I really like this film, but had to by it on VHS from Amazon in England and get it transferred from PAL format in the U.S. I read the book when I was in hight school, after having seen a portion of the film in the early 60s on T.V. The taunt drama of Peter and John trying to escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than the treck of the escapes portrayed in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure, that should be made more available to American audiences.#1
1947_8#SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by  front loading  some Voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that time line has been eradicated, so its all moot.) I did like how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having Janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew(s) pulled it off.#1
3973_7#This is an entertaining  history  of the FBI, but it should be viewed as fiction, because thats exactly what it is. What else could it be when J. Edgar Hoover personally approved and had a cameo role in the production. James Stewart is excellent, as usual, and the supporting cast, except for the talentless Vera Miles, is good. Murray Hamilton is especially good in a supporting role as Stewarts partner and best friend. The FBI accomplishments that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true. What is significant is what it leaves out. As I said at the outset, this is pretty good entertainment, but it should be viewed as the sanitized fictionalization that it is.#1
1862_1#Its not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-off for bored audiences. Its the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch. Im sorry but I do not see the fun in this. Just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well Im wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriffs not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman.#0
3701_2#I was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham. Bad dialogue, worse (worst) acting, lifeless all the way, and the cast knew it. The two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life, sparkle, and were captivating.#0
856_1#These writings write about the end of the plot so dont read it if you havent seen this rubbish. The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. Thats all that happens and as you can see its rubbish.#0
12352_1# How this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me. The script is so banal, and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon. The cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore however, shows none a surprise by participating in this film, if one looks at her tracklist. All in all, a  high concept  style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.#0
544_8#I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, he kills men also. And the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly, when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and he is describing Kimberlys last moments before she is thrown to the water, And secondly, When Stanley is visiting Allison in his basement, right before they head down to the set, when she kisses him. Those scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting. I gave the movie a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, I mean, there were times when youd notice nothing was wrong, like its being shot the way a film is usually shot, you wouldnt see the  live  camera shooting, but then, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes. what went wrong??#1
2578_10#Superman and the Mole Men is quite possibly Supermans toughest adventures ever. 10/10 Stars#1
1901_7#Its hard to put your finger on this one. Basically I suppose its a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a (comparatively) poor girl, whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family. Its corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleapit.#1
11424_1#I noticed  Fire  was on cable the other night and I began watching it because I couldnt recall anything specific about it other than I remember it being a horrible film when I saw it back in 85. Twenty years later the film is still awful. Besides the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as is evident in the title song. Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them. And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowes character played saxophone, and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker, only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were intensely unappealing, although I must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them. Actually I thought Mare Winningham was appealing, and I initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear, but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with Rob Lowes character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon.#0
3014_8#This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. I was happy to see William Powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of his Nick Charles character (from the  Thin Man  series). While the story is good on its own, I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is Michael Curtiz fantastically imaginative direction. From a visual point of view, this is a richly textured movie, with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; from split screen images, to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors. Highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie.#1
2926_8# It even beats the nasty  raw . Almost twenty years old is this show and still I laughed VERY MUCH when I was watching it last night. It shows Eddie Murphy dressed in tight red clothes(Old School)and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family. He was only 22-years old then and this is a must-see! 8/10#1
5761_4#Hollywood does it again. Lots of money, no creativity. Im sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one. Based on the previews, I thought that this would be a funny movie. But if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then youll miss most of the silly humor in this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide. #0
6484_1#I suppose it was for Temple Matthews who written basically a remake even though there are few changes which just make it worse. SPOILERS It is much similar to the original. Melody, Ariels new daughter is threatened by Ursulas sister, Morgana. Morgana escapes, but keeps her promise to take Melody away from them. Did Ursula have a sister?! And she is not that great a villain as Ursula was. This is where there is similarity. Medoly is kept from the sea until Morgana is captured, but she doesnt know a thing about it, because it all happened when she was a baby. A wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out. She goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with Sebastian, who is not as funny or fun as in the original. She finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds Morgana. Here is a similarity; Morgana tricks Melody, making her happy by turning here into a mermaid. Meanwhile, Eric, Melody and King Triton look for her. To stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from Triton. So Melody does, because she does not know King Triton is her father. She makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful. The penguins who live with them in an icy ocean, hate them because they are cowards. So they try to prove they are heroes and fail. That does not suit the little mermaid. And the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is ear-bleeding. you know why? Because the first had a great story. This one is not and is not magical. It is just an example of how bad many sequels are. Well, I suppose that is it for me. I hope you find my comment useful, because I am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view.#0
11496_4#an acted/manipulated documentary about one of the most darkest places of guatemala. portrayed as a fun, secure but sad place, were a bunch of sex workers get to play in a soccer team, assembled in what seems like no more than a week! the documentarys main focus is to prove that society repels this kind of  workers , even though no solution to these poor women is ever achieved, except that the people who documented this,made them some sort of  stars  (just like the title says so) in exchange of being exploited for making this realityshowlike documentary. it does have, however, its own documented reality but, that sadly has nothing to do with the main storyline. i would not accept to see it again; but i would recommend it for general cultural purposes only.#0
9560_9#admittedly, I first picked up Ranma 1/2 when I was around twelve. I was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read. Then, I went to the Comic/Manga section and spotted this book. At my first few reads through the chapters I didnt really know what was going on, but I knew that I LOVED it. I even took it home for a few more reads over. Frankly, I wasnt getting anywhere. And then, about five months (Im 16 now) ago my friend was watching some anime series and I remembered about this Manga. I couldnt remember what it was called, but recalled that the author was Rumiko Takahashi, creator of Inu Yasha. I Googled it, and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes. At first I was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics, but it didnt really matter in the end. No anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind, watch again. I once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day. I dont know how I did it but I couldnt stop. Eventually, after about two days, I grew obsessed. I even dreamt--as crazy as this sounds--about watching Ranma. Never have I found a series so enjoyable, so funny, and so heartwarming to watch. To this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied. Of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers, but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading.  Trust me. Its worth watching. Its humorous, heartwarming and all around amazing.#1
5910_2#This film is not even worth walking to the movie theatre. No jokes, but stupid and boring laughing on repeated disgusting stuff. The music and the girls are great, unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them. It was weak, very very weak.#0
2694_3#warningIt contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene then its a bad movie. (see for example 300). This one confirms the above lemma. The second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Even more, other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. And this made more frustrated. To compensate the consequent lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters. And oh yes, they have lots to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more?, he is cheating his wife, more?, he plans to rob his father, more?, his wife is cheating with his brother, more?, he doesnt regret his complicity to his mothers death, more?, he is a serial killer, more? etc etc its not enough space to write here I wonder how could he have a top job. And why his wife didnt leave him before. On the other hand I enjoy much the performances of the actor Hoffman. Also its a lot of sentimentality, for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parentslives before the crime.#0
9057_3# What an absolutely crappy film this is. How or why this movie was made and what the hell Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me. Strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick DO NOT waste your time on this film.#0
1900_8#The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981s ARTHUR, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if youre in the right mood. Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who  races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and hes his own boss.  Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her fathers birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthurs acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthurs behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Lindas father. Stephen Elliott as Susans father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthurs demented grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.#1
10471_10#I enjoyed this film yet hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music businesswho are now still trying to become adults.no more fans,groupies,money etcand they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular lifeas they see the new bands etc getting the spotlightit is almost like they have to begin anewthis film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70s and 80s are going through now.and thats where I find the film sad and depressing.BUT it portrays the life of an old rock star-abandoned and lost-in a believable way.The young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous)and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for. This film is a must have for folks in their 50s who have seen the rise and fall of bands,people who knew the members, and have watched them hurt as age creeps in,and popularity fades.This is an almost perfect movie.sad but in a way positive.because of the whales. A MUST SEE!#1
6582_4#Geez, another Lifetime movie, but once again isnt exactly the worst movie in the world, but far from the best. I think the main problem is that its pretty obvious who is responsible for what, and its generally fairly predictable. Worse yet, some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing, and the viewer is left wondering  Okay, how much am I supposed to care?  One thing I did like is that the movie goes to show you that its never THAT simple as  the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad , and sometimes it IS evil vs evil rather than good vs evil. Hadley didnt do what she did out of a sense of justice, she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family, AND to eliminate the competition. As for Alicia, it simply proves that a victim isnt always a good person. Some of them really do  have it coming , even if  it  was a painful, horrible death.  The Burning Bed  is a great example of this, but the difference is that the vile man in  The Burning Bed  got exactly what he deserved. But, did Alicia  have it coming ? Some will say that she did, but others dont agree, and the law generally doesnt either. Anyway, worth checking out at least once #0
5291_8#It has only been a week since I saw my first John Waters film (Female Trouble), and I wasnt sure what to expect the second time around. I am going to have to look for more of Waters work, especially Hairspray, now that that is in the news.#1
12249_2#You, know, I can take the blood and the sex, but that thong bikini shot pretty much did me in. Someone get that girl some pasta before its too late! I gave this one a 2, just because its marginally better than Tobe Hoopers CROCODILE.#0
11339_10#Anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie films protagonist, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. Is Jake (a mesmerizing Anthony DeMarco) simply  transferring  the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image? Or could the creature be real? Writer/director Shelli Ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. Her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia. Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are highly convincing as the angry, but loving parents. However it is the creepy minor characters, Mrs. Bender(Barbara Gruen), an unhinged babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a sleazy Real estate agent that linger in the mind. Jakes Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of Hell.#1
10758_1#This is probably the most boring, worse and useless film I have seen last year. The plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix, with plenty of clichés the lone wolf cop, good looking, psychologically disturbed, sleeping with his gun + nice hard worker and shy, but good looking she-scientist, you add a 2 cent plot and you have I, Robot! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like FedEx,Audi,converse etc. This movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec. I wouldnt recommend this to my worse enemy, if you have some spare time, watch a good TV program instead or better read a nice book.#0
217_3#This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.That is it.The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the  sex scenes  is absolutely absent.The acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a gutless and shallow movie.It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama. Ah and on top of that, one more thing why are inner monologues so excessively used? Makes it seem so cheap.All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they cant act #0
11661_7#While watching this movie I was frustrated and distracted and by the end, I wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on. Even my A.D.D couldnt keep up. It felt like a slight acid trip. Everything looked flat, there was no dimension to anything. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie mid-way and smash my burned copy of this movie. But after I finish watching it, I went online to read up on the movie and I should have done a little research into this movie before watching. ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com#1
12024_2#Quite the most boring nonsense I have seen in a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance, and the acting was the worst I have seen in a long time. Oh, and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done. Better lighting next time, please.#0
1603_9#Im really suprised this movie didnt get a higher rating on IMDB. Its one of those movies that could easily get by someone, but for romantic comedy  Moonstruck  is really in a class by itself. Its setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted. The casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie. Few movies in the 1980s were as good as  Moonstruck and its funny too.      out of      #1
2673_8#The Journey of Hope (1990) is about a trek that many nomadic and poor Turks make so they could live the good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live like Westerners that theyll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. So many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation. One family braves the cold, the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that theres not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists world wide, not just in America. Some people tend to forget that. A heart breaker of a film thatll leave you wondering why at the end. Highly recommended.#1
8906_8#Some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something DVD menu system. I tell you the people, I watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times. It was awesome. A cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was, which was the very beginning. Many times the sum and Bam! I was hooked. Over and over and over. And over. The Blob. See it. Steve Queen, two cops, and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs way up #1
1305_1# Demons III The Ogre  is not related pre-sequel are on  The Demons  and  The Demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic. Demons III The Ogre  is very stupid, bored, cheap monster. I am very confuse about the writer is  Demons III The Ogre  (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored William Shakespeare ghost or demons egg from Spiders web or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). I am very sorry, very very very very boring movie. I Bought The special DVD box called  Demons  on the 3 different movies called  Demons III The Ogre ,  The Other Hell , and  Black Demons  dont have closed captioned and Subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like  Halloween III  dont have Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween. I am very confused. I really love  The Demons  and  The Demons 2 are better the boring stupid  Demons III The Ogre  is not part for  The Demons  and  The Demons 2  are same demons. Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre#0
8188_1#The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint, he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever. Lets forget that in order to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and saints dont have significant others. That, for a millennium, Nick has been the Jolly Elf to Freds Scrooge is never even hinted at! Open on Nick learning how to make toys, then on Fred learning how to run numbers; Nick giving a sick child a dolly, Fred repossessing the dolly, along with the family farm! After a few more such episodes, morph to present-day Fred venting his spleen at Siblings Anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy. There, I just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy! The nimrods behind Fred Claus should be boiled in their own pudding! Bah #0

9639_4#Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up raw. American films, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences world wide remain hungry for  different  films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film  To the Left of the Father  offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of its obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets its members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, but does takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it.    #0
9971_1#I cant for the life of me remember why--I must have had a free ticket or something--but I saw this movie in the theater when it was released. I dont remember who I went with, which theater I was in, or even which city. All I remember was how offended I was at this travesty someone dared to call a film, and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over. Unfortunately I stuck it out to end, which I still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far. My offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says  Look for Problem Child 2, coming soon!  That was hands-down THE most terrifying moment ever recorded on film. I would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of Police Academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of Problem Child again. 1/10, only because I cant give it a negative score, which is what it really deserves. Someone burn the original negatives of this film, please #0
3524_1#This is one of the worse cases of film drivel I have seen in a long while. It is so awful, that I am not sure where to begin, or even if it is worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for Sly as he puts in a decent performance for his part. But that plot  Oh dear oh dear. I particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top, whilst the helicopter is on the way. A climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes! I could go on but it isnt worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of) the rest is drivel. Sorry folks, but this is about as bad as film making gets.#0
9006_7#Helena Bonham Carter is the center of this movie. She plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity. Kenneth Branagh was tolerable. The movie itself was good not exceptional. If you are a Helena Bonham Carter fan it is worth seeing.#1
8757_2#Ostensibly a film that predicts the coming trends in British popular music, its wrong on so many fronts that its laughable. Tommy Quickly? The Honeycombs? The movie DOES include a song by the Spencer Davis group, two by the Animals, and one tacked on live film of the Beatles doing their live version of Twist and Shout (all 120). But all in all, an awkward display of British music circa 1964. Oh, and Hermans Hermits.#0
5051_1#Im both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam, and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers. Yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the  hype  would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces ever did. Fact the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of  mostly true  fiction is the way things really were there.#0
7175_10#This film is brilliant! It touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way. It really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories. There are so many layers to this film. It is innovative and absolutely fabulous!#1
1184_3#this movie had a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow very slow indeed. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched. no winnings here, skip this utter boredom. ive seen worse believe me, but this is just waste of time, and i dont get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings#0
10817_10#Well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen. The effects are so bad you just have to laugh, and the acting, well lets say its no mel gibson. But Gary Browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad, he becomes good. I dont know how but he him self makes this movie a 10. You must see it if your in to horror/slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time. Killer movie.#1
5187_7#This series was just like what you would expect from Mr.Spielberg. It is truly one of those frighting, funny, childish shows that you wont forget. Just like Outer Limits (another great show) this little series does what not a lot can. It was great, and deserved to run longer. It was a great show, that even kids could watch, though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be, but all of them always had a moral at the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize what situation you didnt want to end up in, or ones that you did. I remember watching some of these on Sci-fi when I was 10, and even now, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Truly a fun, imaginative show. I loved it, and still do.#1
11906_2#Watching  Der himmel über Berlin  as a teen in the late 80s was a profound experience for me -  so this was what the movies could be . Along with  Paris, Texas  and  Until the End of the World  it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders. Has the well run dry? Whatever the reason, its time for Mr. Wenders to either step it up or stop altogether.#0

7823_7#An overlong, but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other out, but the second half isnt as strong, due to the elimination of the Biko character. Still, its a compelling film with great performances by Kline and Washington, in the film that put the latter on the map. Washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time. Overall, a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit. 7/10. #1
7818_1#I usually dont walk out of a movie, but halfway thru I did. This movie promised something different, but I kept thinking havent I seen that before? Spoiler Alert! Back in 1, the spaceship crashes and lands on earth, well, all these years later, with a super adult on board no less, this thing still manages to burn up and crash! What, this advanced civilization cant seem to develop landing gear? For an industry thats so liberal, we get to see another Woody Allen movie, no blacks please! Superman runs around saving people, making sure he sticks to Europe and the US, dont go into darkie areas please. Maybe I could stomach this about 30 years ago, but now now.#0
2705_10#This is a script that Ed Wood worked over 10 years on trying to get made. Aris Iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a script that Wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other, more transitory valuables. The design is perfect, the pyramid set exquisite, and Ron Perlmans beastly performance is simply wonderful. Overall, this is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of Ed Wood Jr., auteur and cinenephile. A must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate Iliopulos and his cast obviously do. A film to make you wish you had made it yourself.#1
7263_10#Very heart warming and uplifting movie. Outstanding performance by Alisan Porter (Curly Sue). I saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it immensely. I just caught it again on the Mplex channel, and Curly Sue touched my heart again.#1
4314_10#I revisited Grand Canyon earlier this year when I set out to devise a ten best list of the 1990s. I first saw the film when I was 17 years old. How did I hear about it? It was reviewed, and recommended highly, by Siskel & Ebert in 1991, and I eventually caught it on video a year later. I fear that Grand Canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non-new releases at the video store. But with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents, I plead with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it, Grand Canyon is something special. If you loved Magnolia, another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes, youll love Grand Canyon, too.#1
11698_10#I would say for its time, this movie was awesomeand yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind seriesthey run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistakendont use our comments to judge, see the movie for yourself  God will bless you if that is why you are watching them.#1
8946_1#I think that the shots and lighting were very poor. When I watched it for the first time I thought it was the old version(1956). When I really found out the true year of the film I was shocked. I didnt know that there could be such a bad film made so recently. Thats really all I wanted to say. This film had a good plot though, nothing you couldnt miss out on if you would simply read the novel that George Orwelll wrote. All I really want to say has already been said except for this I cant believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations.I gave this film a One (awful), because I felt that it was very badly made. Well that is all. So long#0
3711_4#I had not seen the movie trailer when I went to see the movie, instead I based my judgments on a friends opinions. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on its face. The plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole. Some parts were discontinuous altogether. If the supporting cast were meant to be funny, they certainly didnt do a good job. The couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and dull. Rocks first incarnations couple of underlings were also bland. If theres one thing they did do right, though, they made Rock seem funnier by comparison.#0
4807_10#I really thought that this movie was superb. Not only is the history correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunts portrayal of Victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth. Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of Albert. There have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009s best!#1
6893_3#I had high hopes for this movie. The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man, with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies.  I am very disappointed and think I wasted an hour and a half of my life.#0
9118_10#I saw this film with a special screening of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah. It is so interesting where did this guy come from. Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world. And I am not talking about black filmmakers I am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of African themes, with his film 500 Years Later it is a African issue. But the Idea doesnt fit that mold. Showing the artistic diversity. The film is an all African cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to. I just love the mild comedy in it. And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing, it is really a art-house gem.#1
2257_7#Sarafina was a fun movie, and some of the songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. I dont normally like music things like this, but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box. The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of 1976. It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience, and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government, who you can not sympathise with. The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent. The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto. They made the movie actually in Soweto, which is why it looks very accurate in many parts. All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied. As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented. As I said before, you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective. Also, it changes some of the details from other accounts. In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto, but this is probably an exaggerated event. The police and army did shoot students, but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied. The teacher was arrested for being against the government, and the mum goes to work in a white persons house. But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws. -By George S, Chris and Finlay#1
8845_3#I watched this knowing almost nothing about it, other than the brief description I read here. After watching it I was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish, then I looked at the other stuff hes done to see if this was his first or second movie, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one. The story was pretty awful too, could someone just fall in love with a girl because shes pretty but has the mind of a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible.#0
1294_7#Unremittingly bleak and depressing, the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised Houellebecqs controversial novel of the same name. Like many French films, its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow - or should that be, slowly painful? While this is an excellent and challenging film, it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the right mood to see it.#1
7583_2#David Leans worst film. Even In Which We Serve wasnt as bad as this. Usually a film with a really good reputation like this one, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic. But after watching this I just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945! I disliked the acting, stiff upper lip British mannerisms, story, script (which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny) and soundtrack. The elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive, but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice. Just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation. Another very overrated british classic.#0
353_4#As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene shes in. Connery is fine as is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overloud  dramatic  score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see, otherwise skip it.#0
1377_7#In the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s Innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. Here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. The three principals, all unknown to me give very sure-footed performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so I wouldnt be too surprised if they are not heard from again. It would be nice if this could get away from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes where theres just an outside chance it might speak to the bubblegum crowd it isnt aimed at.#1
1357_4# may contain a spoiler of sorts?  The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some geeks panties in a bunch. His landmark appearance in Back to the Future as George McFly has sealed him into the American conscience forever. More recently, he has been trying to get back into the culty subconscious with Bartleby and Willard. rating C#0

7873_8#Page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye-opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocrite lifestyles of Mumbais elite. From the fake kisses to the plastered smiles, Page 3 leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption, and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glam. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where Social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality. Everyone is constantly craving for more money, more fame, and a higher reputation, driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing film contracts at a funeral to child molestation. Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist. She observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind-boggling frenzy that the socialites live in. Bollywood, business tycoons, politicians, and the underworld are all intertwined in a completely convoluted mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice track as is the peppy Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Terrific film with excellent character development!#1
6649_8#It was easy for Sir Richard Attenborough to make Gandhi (1982)he was merely narrating a story of a great individual who walked on this planet not so long ago. Comparatively, it must have been a lot tougher for director Feroz Abbas Khan making his debut as a filmmaker to make Gandhi my father, pitting a shriveled anti-hero against an international hero, both of whom were historically real individuals, and ironically father and son. The events in the film are mostly real. Mahatma Gandhi lived as shown in the film, setting high moral standards for the world to follow. Yet these very standards overshadowed the aspirations of his eldest son Harilal to be a lawyer of repute like his father, to complete his education and get a job in India and thus provide income for his nuclear family. The film won the Best actress award at the Tokyo International Film Festival for Shefali Shetty (Shah) and an Indian award from critics. Feroze Khan and Anil Kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above-average performances from the ensemble of actors. I do hope the international success of the film paves the way for some able director to film another brilliant Indian play Girish Karnads Tughlaq some day meeting international quality standards.#1
9356_3#Marilyn Miller made only three films before her untimely death - the marvelous SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this trifle - SUNNY (1930). It is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - although she has four dance numbers, she only sings two songs (WHO? and ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned, although we can hear the latter in the background scoring. Miller looks overweight and amateurish here - no star quality at all. Even her dancing is cloutish. The film is very badly written, stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations. If youre interested in Miller as a performer, by all means, check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.#0
3229_7#In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier, directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell. The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite. A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todds generation is suddenly obsolete. What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life Fear and discipline. Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes. This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any hes done before. And hes given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum). Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `Soldier reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. Its an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldnt make a whole lot of difference. Much like `1984, and `Mad Max, this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share. I rate this one 7/10.#1
8874_8#higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us that have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic background. its a subject most of us would like to ignore but we cannot afford to if there is to be a real progressive change in the way we HAVE TO be able embrace and understand diversity.some have criticized this film as hateful or dumb but the fact of the matter is, ignorance reigns supreme in the world and several continue to help it dominate our society.everyone involved in this film has done a good deed in showing what steps must continue to be done in order to not have to make anymore films like higher learning.sure it sounds like a pipe dream but we have to start somewhere and this helps.#1
6094_10#These two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that got a good TV series, so lets compare. Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddys Nightmares - ANOES The Series & Robocop The Series I would personally choose Robocop#1
3488_4#Question how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration ? Answer by turning it into an existential alienation parable. Anyway, it cant be that bad, Angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all, right ? Wrong. Its at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial, sort of like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks show up there are blurred windows, blurred lights, a weird wedding, a walk by the river-shore, and people with yellow water-coats. Also Mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever. Avoid really. Go for his early films.#0
2313_10#This  coming of age  film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer. I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc.#1
6706_1#I saw this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival if I recall. I liked it, it showed great potential. I guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together (by the filmmakers own admission on the official site -- the short was exhibited as a  rough-cut ). But nonetheless, it was an easy-going comedy. I think many people try to read far too much into a comedy. All they are supposed to do is make you laugh -- thats all. I did just that at its showing, so it succeeded on that level. Just my 2 Cents Anyway.#0
315_10#I absolutely LOVED this Soap. It has been one of my favorite. Will highly recommend ) I just love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. Im really sad that the soap ended but Im sure Ill be able to find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see it. I loved the characters, the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains. The only thing I would have changed is the end for Xica and her long life love. I cant wait to see it again and highly recommend it. Xica has been by far, the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else )GO XICA.. Hope you all like it as well.#1
2928_2#Id really, really wanted to see this movie, and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it showed up in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. Good acting, like I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing.#0
10800_1#What was the point of this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq cant act, people dont know how to direct, and I am Kazaam! A genie who raps? Come on. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this. I remember I watched this just to kill time. It didnt really interest me. I just remember thinking,  Who put Shaq in this movie???  The whole story seemed stupid too. It made no sense whatsoever. I guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I cant comment much more because this movie is so terrible theres nothing worth commenting about. I  wish  this movie would go away.#0
8670_8#WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 -- Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA  Being an on-and-off WWE fan, I have to agree that Armageddon was laced up with numerous eye-catchers throughout, and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show; the Last Ride match featured some fairly nerve-wrenching spots, and the main event also did very well for its category. All other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the Boogeyman vs. The Miz bout and the ever-useless lingerie contest. Overall Armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes this years goodbye respectably. PPV rating 8/10.#1
8528_3#Whats written on the poster is  At birth he was given 6 years to live At 34 he takes the journey of a lifetime.  Ami is an American-born Israeli who was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy disease at the age of one. At age of 34, after the love toward his 22 years old care-giver didnt go well, he decided to come to the US to face the doctor who said that he would have only 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive, and weights 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, even I have seen this film. Obviously its courageous to live when all he can move is his left index finger, but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mom that based on the medical history, people with his disease wont live long. Whats the point of him showing up at old doctors door for? Why is tracking down this old doctor in the US is a journey of his lifetime? There are so many things we might be interested in Amis life how can he make those animations with the movement of only one finger? How can he go through daily lives while totally depending on others? How did he out lived his doctors prediction? How does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like looking at a strange creature? The movie told us none of that. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let Ami to show up at his old doctors door in order to show him that he is still alive. I thought it was a joke.#0
4690_9#Twenty five years ago, I showed this film in some childrens classes in Entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids; they were spellbound! It is not just about the termites who have built and live in the  Castles of Clay,  but also about the other animals who use the mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch. It is a not only good for entomology classes, but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds.  I wish it was available on DVD, so that I could watch it again and show others.#1
8539_8#Touching and sad movie. Portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident. The film centers on his relationship with his married lover, whom he is often very hostile towards, and his interactions with other accident victims, particularly a black down-and-out and a white-supremacist biker. The film is often humorous, often sad, and always believable. Get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy Sunday afternoon with your partner.#1
12236_2#Quite simply this shouldnt have been made. Its predictable and clichéd. The on screen chemistry which made the first  My Girl  so captivating is nowhere to be found here, and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced. The writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the memorable lines such as  earpeircing a barbaric custom  are just shocking. Where  My Girl  provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments, like so many sequels  My Girl 2  tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience, and fails miserably. Maybe im being hard on this film because of how great the first one was, but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up. Surely this has to come close to  Son of the mask  as being one of the worst sequels of all time. In both cases, the old saying rings true;  if it aint broke, dont fix it .#0
1406_4#This  movie  is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies, he feels like making music, and when he is making music, he feels like making movies. The best thing in  Promise me this  is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica. However, I know some people, who liked  Promise me this , they find it very positive movie.#0
1743_2#Contrary to its title, this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish. All Humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of those Pakistani plays available on video, including even the mannerisms. Everybody is screaming, shouting and doing odd things for no reason. The premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from Hollywoods Boeing Boeing . John Abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here. If we keep morality factor aside, even then the bizarre events looks trite. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain. At least, the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless, buxomed bimbettes (3Bs) who talk, behave and even scream in quite similar fashion. The major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other? Just to do some Sex, what else? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily. But surely, great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial. Now for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. Sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic, weird and maddening type of humor, where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things?#0
7102_2#OK, I admit I watched this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I am a huge fan of), but I am not one of those people who automatically gives an MST3K movie a 1/10 rating. Although I hate many of the movies they play, and some are among of the worst movies Ive ever seen, I have actually been able to enjoy some MST3K movies. That being said, this is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen. (It is no wonder, in fact, that the MST3K writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst. Dont believe me? Check out their site.) 1/10#0
1607_9#As someone else has already said here, every scene in this film is gem. Most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect, but director Jewison hit a home run every time. The cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, Dick Hymans musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match. Hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera-work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative. Cher is such a comedy natural, Vincent Gardenia (who I know mostly through his Frank Lorenzo role on All in the Family until I saw him in this and then off-Broadway in the 80s)deserved far greater stardom than he ever got, and Aiellos hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast. Has Jewison ever written about this film? Would love to read it. Hard to figure out why the average rating here at IMDb is so low#1
2658_10#Kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Of course it doesnt hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances Ive ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but its easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).#1
4439_8#Best-selling horror novelist Cheryl (a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (the likable Paolo Serra), and their son Bobby (nicely played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a remote castle located in the countryside for summer vacation. Local legend claims that the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy, nasty ogre (hulking David Flosi in a strikingly hideous costume) living in the basement. Cheryl has to surmount her deep-seated childhood fear of the beast so she can defeat the foul find. Director/co-writer Lamberto Bava does an expert job of creating and sustaining an eerie and unnerving nightmarish mood. Moreover, Bava eschews the standard bloodnguts fright flick routine in favor of crafting a compelling and provocative dark adult fairytale-like fable on how the best way to overcome that which frightens us is to face said source head on. Sturdy supporting turns by Sabrina Ferilli as friendly school teacher Anna, Stefania Montorsi as hottie babysitter Maria, and Alex Serra as batty painter Dario. Gianfranco Transuntos glossy cinematography boasts a few fluid tracking shots and plenty of great atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforzas gnarly make-up f/x, Simon Boswells splendidly spirited spookynshuddery score, and the dank, dark, cobweb-covered cellar set all hit the skin-crawling spot. Well worth watching.#1
9897_10#Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love the whole 80s genre of these kind of movies, because you dont see many like this one anymore! I want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off, or a cheesy imitation, what is it imitating? Ive never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway. ~ ~CupidGrl~ ~#1

2581_8#People are being too hard on the film. Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to  review  it. Id love to get a copy of it to view it again. In light of what is known today, The Domino Principle is right on.#1
2353_1#Madhur has given us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past. His next film Page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time. It apparently tells the story of some high class people in India. After seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidently i did. The reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing stuff, there was no need to show the children fully naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people, British men in this movie. I am shocked to know this film was a Hit in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in UK, USA and Australia. Im from UK, and this kind of stuff makes me sick, shouldnt of been released in UK.#0
10168_2#Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made. The whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl, and all the attempts made to stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills careers managed to survive this is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about it was THERE WAS NO FOOTBALL IN IT AT ALL! Avoid this one if possible.#0
5809_4#I cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie.  So i think that there was no need to remake it, or if they decided to remake a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt#0
8475_3#(NOTE I thought Id be the only one writing what I did below, but I see the others here agree. I guess it was pretty obvious - this was overdoing the bait-the-cat bit. Anyway, here is what I had written) This is a frustrating story, and why they make the sadistic mouse the  good guy  is beyond me. Its like some of the Tom & Jerry cartoons where poor Tom always gets the worst of it even though many times the little mouse starts the conflict #0
8537_10#I thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable. The acting was top-notch and the movie reminded me of  One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest .#1
5707_2#I watched this movie last night on one of the pay-per-view channels, and while watching it I quickly wondered why I bothered. In all honesty I really did expect something more from this film. Maybe something along the lines of Conspiracy Theory. Why? Maybe because of the casting. I mean, Nicolas Cage and Harvey Keitel, after all. Not to mention Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer. Now Im wondering, why did they bother? But instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama I was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a là The Goonies, which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise. Perhaps its because The Goonies was clearly targeted toward the pre-teen and teen audiences. Whereas National Treasure, judging from the previews, was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience. Okay, okay. If you pant over chases, explosions, and gee-whiz gimmickry youll enjoy National Treasure. But its the sort of movie, well, have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out? And all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like,  Wow! Did you see how that thing blew up? That was so cool!  National Treasure is that kind of movie.#0
3128_9#Corny! I love it! Corny - just as the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt rekindle the same on-screen chemistry that never seems to have left! They re-live old memories, plus the actors that play them from the 1960s show some behind-the-scenes things which are quite interesting to know. 1960s TV was corny escapism for so many of us back then, and this DVD is no exception, if you are familiar with the original TV show. The fight scene with the written Boofs and Bams or whatever is fantastic  The movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away. At the end Frank Gorshin makes an appearance. He passed away not too long after this DVD was made, I believe, so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to Adam and Burt, just as he did to Batman & Robin so many years ago. He didnt lose his touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar to re-living a villain role, also. In conclusion I think that this DVD is for great memories, and I wish to thank both Adam and Burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original-  Thanks, Guys #1
4491_1#1/10 and thats only because I dont go lower with my ratings. all in all a shameless ploy to make money (especially off the guys who went to see it more then once), which evidently worked like a charm.#0
6943_1#This movie is deeply idiotic. A man wants revenge for a crime- but when he enacts his revenge- there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time. What man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera? If only these people writing this story hadnt been so dumb as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never happen this way. To the writers I say- seek help for your serious mental problem.#0
11651_3#Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness (81 minutes - including end credits, so roughly 76 minutes of actual film). But what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed. One thing though, the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this movie a  3  out of  10 .#0
7929_4#I guess if you are into the sci-fi and horror stuff it might be interesting. The acting was okay but not great. The two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty-one at the time. The plot is okay, but the story does jump around a bit, leaving one guessing whether youre in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use warp speed between the two. The catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith. What if the two girls had been protestant? Would the catholics of cared? Therefore some what contrived. Who knows, some day the catholic church might even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this one, dont feel youve lost anything.#0
7885_1#I believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies. When I want a sermon, Ill go to church, but I dont want one from a movie. I dont mind some supernatural themes, (after all, religion is about as supernatural as you can get!) but this movie had so much preaching in it that I was really annoyed. The landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies. The bad guy even looked like he had horns.  And what a silly ending the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men, and that broke the spell. If only life were that simple. I think that when movies are that stupid, they ought to be distributed with a warning DANGER! PREACHING CONTAINED HEREIN!#0
6705_10#And its not because since her days on  Clarissa Explains It All  that Ive had a bit of a crush on Melissa Joan Hart, who at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s, but was still able to get teenage roles.  Sabrina, the Teenage Witch  was Harts next big leap after her  Clarissa  days. Based on the comic strip, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life. She is aided in her endeavors by her two aunts and a wise-cracking black cat as she goes from high school, to college, and finally to her career in journalism. 10/10#1

12285_10#Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). The film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.#1
11822_10#Dick Tracy is one of my all time favorite films. I must admit to those that havent seen it. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyones expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. But its based on a comic stripwhat did you expect? Creatively, this movie is amazing! The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the impressive acting make this film fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - thats something rare these days. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against Al Pacinos evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. She has the best one liners Ive heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public. To sum things up, this film brings out the child in all of us. Its a film that will leave you smiling at the end.#1
7354_4#As a Hammer completist I was dreading the time when I would have to raise the courage to watch this film and the one following it, Holiday on the Buses. I had seen One the Buses the film and thought it one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was full of all the awful comedy that plagued British TV screens around the early 70s. The only people who would want to watch this film are probably fans of the TV series, who will no doubt enjoy this, and Hammer completists like myself. To the completists I would say that this film isnt that bad and I can certainly think of worse Hammer comedies.#0
1355_1#I saw Crispin Glovers  What Is It?  at the Ann Arbor film festival. Admittedly, the film was at least aptly named, because I got the distinct sense that even the writer/director could provide no answer. At the question and answer session after the screening, Mr. Glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with down-syndrome. However, this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film. Actors are, in my opinion, building blocks for a larger vision - a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worst. Glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film. If only it had been. At seventy-two minutes, the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty, and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time.#0
1769_4#1st watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mick Garris) Campy vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for King fans. Its the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers(a shape-shifting feline-like, flesh eating, life needing, near extinct breed of humanoid) who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive. They come across as pretty normal upper-class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home, day and night. Cats are deadly to them, so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down. We get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack(which is also a first in my movie-going experience) --- hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film. The boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a  sleepwalker  and then he just wants her body. There is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all-out satirical comedy on suburban life, but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish hed just get over it and bring out the gore. Eventually that happens and the movie winds down to its typical Stephen King downbeat ending. The movie is interesting because Kings humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection, but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesnt cut it.#0

8864_10#What an extraordinary crime thriller  My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival. Its already my second favourite film of all-time after DR. STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife. There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOURE DEAD stands in a league of its own. As an aside, the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage. Tomei didnt speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked  Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy?  That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene #1
709_2#This movie was so badly written, directed and acted that it beggars belief. It should be remade with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is the acting. You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand who is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, Richard, who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave owning (and keeping) couple, although both normally do fine work. The actors (and director) should not have attempted to do accents at all--they are inconsistent and unbelievable. Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English. The casting is ludicrous. Why have children of an  African  merchant (thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel, has pronounced African features, including an obviously dyed blond  fro ? Its as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. Its just so weird! This could be a great movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors. There are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.#0
1747_10#This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didnt see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better put together movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a whole bunch of T&A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie  If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roepers review of this movie is right on. I mean, I dont really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.#1
10386_4#This could have been interesting  a Japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed American family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director. At one point, an old monk turns up at the house to warn Albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually, hes called upon to exorcise the premises. However, history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death! At the end of the day, this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but, in no way, essential viewing.#0
5811_9#Only a 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot to the movie, but nevertheless Moonwalker to this day remains a fun fest of music, dance and entertainment. Beginning with the montage of video clips from Jacksons long career, it reminds the viewer of just why he is often regarded as The King of Pop. From his hit I want you back to We are the World the multi-award winning charity record for the benefit of Africa. Following this a short movie of sorts, although lacklustre in an Oscar winning script, nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. Ending with a perfect (sexy!) rendition of Come Together. Something the whole family can watch and enjoy.#1
11981_4#Yes, Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running. I do wonder about the central plot mechanism bonds. This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly. I, however, not of that era, am vaguely familiar with them. Theyre like stocks only different, right? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.#0
10022_7#Aro Tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a Mission in Guatemala in the 70s. Also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women, and then he set them on fire).  My rate 7/10#1
6966_3#This movie is a mess, but at least its not pretentious. The box art for the video markets it as a  fun throwback  to 1950s giant bug movies. In reality, its a transparent bargain basement ripoff of  Aliens . I havent said anything about the negligible acting, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow. I take it  Blue Monkey  was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces dont come together and the movie ends up being a real drag. See a film called  Return of the Aliens The Deadly Spawn  if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right, with even less money and even more marginal acting talent. This one falls flat on its ALIEN.#0
625_10#This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow. In the end Im sure that Neils writing and this movie wont have the same effect on everyone but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it is easily one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it.#1
9325_1#S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself. There was absolutely no acting to speak of. The best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.The budgeting of this movie was sufficient. The filming was sub sesame street. The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book out there for this movie Im sure its better. I would avoid this at all costs. I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.#0
1228_9#This 1991 NBC-TV movie aired six months before John Goodmans big-screen version of the life of Babe Ruth came out. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. The TV production isnt perfect but it presents the Babes story with more depth and complexity than Goodmans one-dimensional telling. I especially enjoyed the films depiction of the complex love-hate relationship Ruth had with Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood his star players brilliance and also kept trying to point out why Ruths own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players. The TV-movie rightly notes how Ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the Yankees because of his flaws, while the horrible Goodman version tries to push the falsehood that Ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking. This film makes a great companion piece to  Eight Men Out  since the story starts with Ruths arrival in New York in 1920, one year after the Black Sox Scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin. Indeed, the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with John Anderson reprising his  Eight Men Out  role as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.#1

5182_4#Like most of the festivals entries Hamiltons makes for an interesting watch a film thats all ideas and little execution. Although impressive for its obvious low budget the film falters in its final twist and becomes dreadfully long during its drawn out and obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after there parents have died. They kidnap people , drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement. Theres some nice darkly humorous performances from Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest are just so-so. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter. But for the first half taps into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment. The next half isnt so successful as it receeds into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap. Its a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative. too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every level.   /5#0

3839_1#Some films are so bad that theyre good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about as true to the story as Pinocchios chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible, the direction was poor, and it travelled way too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home. Watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast.#0
12335_9#Warning contains a spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting. Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivys husband, are exceedingly wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place. Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful. More faithful to the book than most movies of its era. Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was just as shocking then - Im not kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke. Shes just her usual Joan Fontainey self. As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling  feet foremost through the floor into an empty space.  #1
8907_4#I rented this on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a  character study  type of movie, so I struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the Stop button. Since I didnt finish watching it Id say there is some merit to renting this film  maybe. To me, it was a waste of good viewing effort and time. Ill leave it up to you to try it, but its not one Id strongly recommend.#0
2032_2#I gave this two stars for the awesome DV shot clarity, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was being generous, I know. Thank you.#0
1825_10#Ive seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. Its a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. I was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. Maybe thats because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and thats why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, but it doesnt matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So dont be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel.#1
1047_8#It may (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason I really checked out this movie in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 role for the Best Actor Oscar. (I still would have given the Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) Well, Im glad I did check this movie out, because I enjoyed it immensely. I think the movie did preach a little, but not only did I not mind, I enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them. 9/10#1
3673_3#William Hurt scuba diving scientist??? US agents running the investigation abroad? The sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper missing and not killing Hurt (just wounding him) but the second  kill  shot is dead on ? Waste of time. To compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous. Oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the  evil  agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the  virus handshake . What? BTWwhen did IMDb require 10 lines of text? Im just babbling here. Doesnt this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines?#0
1612_10#This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It is virtually flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivating and delightful! None quite equals Moonstruck #1
7461_10#Comparable to Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a way never done before. The first 30 minutes builds a interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is, well, confusing, youll pick more every time you watch it (ive gone to the movies to see it 3 times now)#1
4493_1#I tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler. I also assume that youve seen the first movie or at least know the general gist, so if you havent some of this might not make sense. All in all, this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations, and on its own, as a stand-alone movie (which is not how its supposed to be taken), its still horrible. I dont see The Matrix as deep, but I at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas, good action, a few funny lines, and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive. Reloaded fails on all these counts, and I really hope the W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. Granted, I dont have a lot of hope left for that after this film.#0
814_1#This movie was just plain bad. Just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for. Bad guy gets away? check. Partner? check. Wacky personality clash with partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie shows up grizzled veteran. check. About the only ones it didnt touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but I guess theyre saving those old chestnuts for Dooleys next outing. Add in the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like Dooleys prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.#0
5259_9# What is love? What is this longing in our hearts for togetherness? Is it not the sweetest flower? Does not this flower of love have the fragrant aroma of fine, fine diamonds? Does not the wind love the dirt? Is not love not unlike the unlikely not it is unlikened to? Are you with someone tonight? Do not question your love. Take your lover by the hand. Release the power within yourself. Your heard me, release the power. Tame the wild cosmos with a whisper. Conquer heaven with one intimate caress. Thats right dont be shy. Whip out everything you got and do it in the butt. By Leon Phelps  When Tim Meadows created his quintessential SNL playboy, Leon Phelps, I cringed. Hearing his smarmy lisp and salacious comments made my remote tremble with outrage. I employed the click feature more than once, dear readers. Plus its such a total delight to see Billy Dee Williams as Lester, the tavern owner and smooth narrator of Leons odyssey to find his  sweet thing  and a pile of cash. (Where has he been hiding?) But would I choose this movie as my Valentines Day choice? Leons search for the easy life changes him in so many profound ways - that I had to give the nod to our  Ladies Man . That he can, at the movies close, find true happiness with one woman, while still offering his outlandish advice, is the stuff of dreams #1
2073_7#In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous speed trap town. Much revenue was generated by the Sheriffs Department catching speeders. The ones who tried to outrun the Sheriff? Well, that gave the Sheriff a chance to push them off the Clarksberg Curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, in the beginning of the movie, a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths, if I recall correctly. Then one day, a stranger drove into town. Possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a car name, as in McCord gaskets. In possibly the ultimate hot rod. A black flamed 34 Ford coupe. The colors of death, evil and hellfire. He gets picked up for speeding by the Sheriff on purpose. He checks out the lay of the land. He is the brother of one of the Sheriffs victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is all in favor of the Sheriff. Theres only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so  this aint a-ever gonna happen again to anyone  recreate the chase and settle the contest hot-rodder style to the death. He goes out to the Curve and practices. The Sheriff knows McCord knows. The race begins This is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road.#1
9177_1#The House of the Dead was the worst movie I have ever seen, between the pathetic matrix 360 camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting I fell asleep. I dont think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10, (10 being the best, 1 being the worst). Also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time. I beg anyone who reads this, NOT TO SEE IT. Its not worth the time.#0
8185_2#Oh my. I decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends, wanting to watch one of those mild, feel-good Christmas movies, and I walk out disgusted. The movie failed. Full-stop. Paul Giamatti who I consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly, along with Vince Vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine. They try and turn a Christmas movie, into some new-style. Sort of bad, mixed with good, but it all turned out very wrong. The first ten or so minutes werent too bad, but once we saw Santa, it was over. It didnt get any better, the rate stayed the same, there was NO character development, and certainly is one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Dont watch it, whatever you do.#0
2519_10#This movie is really special. Its a very beautiful movie. Which starts with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, Theyre poor childrens, living on the street, but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money, and then their able to live on, to buy a house, and their life seems to become much better. Theyre making new friend, life-friends. But something went wrong and theyre becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other. So if you havent seen this movie, you really should. Because its wonderful, but sad. You wont regret it. ^^#1
4510_7#Insisting that Martin Luther Kings inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school. More specifically, it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a  Dead Poets Society  more than a  Matilda . It treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money.#1
10520_9#I saw this movie being a Jane Austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well, this transposition is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect! The cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (nowadays she would be probably too mature for it), Toni Colette is simply great. And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then, the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension a really enjoyable and deserving movie.#1

5034_7#Frailty is a non-gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a mans delusion/obsession straight into depravity. Dad (we never learn his name) is a gentle man and loving father whos raising his sons alone after Mom died giving birth to the youngest son, Adam. The familys world flips upside down late one night when Dad rushes into the boys room and tells them God has given him a vision. And what a vision  the entire familys job is to destroy demons, who, of course, are disguised in human form. The movie gave me no such comfort, though, as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of Dads vision. And this, as much as some plot holes, posed a problem for me. Regardless of the accuracy of Dads visions, regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed, where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death?

4295_2#This is yet another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie. I kept waiting for it to pick-up, but unfortunately it never did. The acting is fair, but the script needs A LOT of work. And if youre looking for the nudity, dont waste your time with these not so hot actors. Due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you have never seen over five gay films, or have recently come to terms with being gay, you may find this film interesting, otherwise its your run-of-the-mill low budget movie. It ranks as one of the worst gay films I have ever seen.#0
2844_9#I saw New York I Love You today and loved it! I was really looking forward to seeing this after watching Paris je taime and overall I think I liked this one much better Perhaps I need to watch Paris je taime again I dont know I read few of the reviews here about NYILY and yes, the movie is not without its faults. When youre paying tribute to a city like New York - it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems fair enough to do the city due justice so without elaborating on any of the films shortcomings, Ill just write about what I liked. Overall, watch this movie with an open mind. Dont read the reviews before watching it! It might not live up to your expectations of what a movie on and about love in New York should be and I doubt any movie will really live up to that conception. Just watch this movie for some good music, beautiful landscape cinematography, some slice-of-life comfort and a story or two that might just tug at your heartstrings.#1
8361_4#-SPOILES- Lame south of the border adventure movie that has something to do with the blackmail of a big cooperate executive Rosenlski the president of Unasco Inc. by on the lamb beachcomber David Ziegler whos living the life of Reilly, or Ziegler, in his beach house in Cancun Mexico.Having this CD, that he gave to his brother James, that has three years of phone conversations between Rosenlski and the President of the United States involved in criminal deals. This CD has given David an edge over the international mobsters who are after him.  The ending of the movie was about as predictable as you can make it with David thought to be killed by the one-eyed shark later pops up out of the crowd,after Rosenlski was convinced that hes dead and leaves the village. David continues his life as a free living and loving beachcomber with no one looking to kill him and about two million dollars richer. to Davids credit he had his friend Paco give Rosenski back his CD but under the conditions that if anything happened to him his cousin, who Rosenlski doesnt know who and where he is, will shoot his big mouth off and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal dealings.#0
8967_8#The play Bell, Book, and Candle was a favorite of mature actresses to do in summer stock and take on the road. One famous story, told by director Harold J. Kennedy, has Ginger Rogers insisting that her then husband, William Marshall, who was not an actor, costar with her. Marshall wore a toupee, and when he walked through a doorway, his toupee caught on a nail and stayed behind, dangling in the doorway as he walked on stage. Kim Novak is a good fit for Gillian, giving the character a detachment befitting a witch, showing emotion when it becomes appropriate, and with that voice, fabulous face, and magnificent wardrobe, she certainly is magical. Stewart, in his last foray as a romantic lead, costars with Novak as he did in Vertigo, and they make an effective team. He supplies the warmth, she supplies the coolness, and somehow, together they spark. In this, of course, hes much more elegant than in  Vertigo.  A charming film, good for a Sunday afternoon, good around Christmas (as part of it takes place at Christmastime), and great if you feel like smiling.#1
6564_1#This is one of the worst movies i have seen to date, the best part was Christian J. Meoli  Leonard  attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar, kind-of like i wanted to do on the DVD, to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film. It has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good, i mean with Sean Astin  Andrew  (played his part perfectly, did a great job, too bad it was in this film), Kyra Sedgwick  Bevan , Ron Livingston  Chad , Renée Zellweger  Poet  (they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie If the cast had any dignity, they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with Writer / Director George Hickenlooper and Writer John Enbom#0

This movie could not receive a  10  judging from any remotely objective standpoint.#0
3100_10#By the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet. The movie never, and I do mean never, lets up in action. It may be mild action but its action. Once again every member of the cast fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were feasible, and the fighting was incredible. Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne. So dont go see it in theaters, go experience it in theaters if its still out where you live, but if not December 11th Bourne comes home to you!#1
935_4#Users who have rated this movie so highly simply cant have seen enough good films to compare it with. Have they all been brainwashed??

Casino Royale blows it out of the water.#0
9214_7#In what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy, Manuel Gomez Pereira made this film, Things that make life worthwhile.  It is not an original discovery, by many voice you have (quite off the pitch, by the way), but it departs somewhat from the norm in the Spanish cinema. The downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined, and while some points are not well developed, others are out of place. A day in the lives of two people close to the median age. Its basically what the movie Gómez Pereira. Jorge (Eduard Fernandez) is a stationary (parado) one which, despite load on your back with a drama major, seems willing to see things change. Only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence. In line with Audrey Tautou of Long dating (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2004), Jorge says things like this to herself  if I find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck.   Of course it finds it, begins to play Today could be a great day (Hoy puede ser un gran dia)by Joan Manuel Serrat and in a few crosses on its way Hortensia (Ana Belen).She is another woman entry age, divorced and a little lonely. Take valeriana for sleeping, organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother, said her belief in God and leads to a speed of homicidal mother. Hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior, life was going in his head driving data as  70% of people fall in love only once in a lifetime  and said although it is short of Jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a  sadistic  sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity. Later came a communion, a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet, the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer. Things that make life worthwhile debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and, conversely, make us take the case as a comedy, focusing on things like a Chinese singing at a wedding (which seem to be amusing in itself) or the gait of a drunk person. The problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players, therefore we can not identify with the dramatic, and not give us a solid base comic too, leaving everything except pure joke. In the end, all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn, and ends up not doing either. And it is true that something is not seen a thousand times, is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner, but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do. Ana Belén (which apparently far less than the 53 years that has in this film) and Eduard Fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working, but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film, so in moments like the  accident  with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands. Perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do, but that is no excuse to lower our guard. In any case, both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function. Things that make life worthwhile work only up to the modest level of entertainment. Any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled, as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that, we presume, they wanted to do, can not afford to have little moments finished successful (beyond bad) as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh, lost drunk, compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him. Neither do much for people like Rosario Pardo, making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase  must be screwed over,  and songs from the soundtrack, though significant, not just fit. It is true that the film by Manuel Gomez Pereira has its hits (some of the moments involving Jose Sacristan), but the whole is a anodyne Story, a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better.#1
3287_9#My friend and I picked  Paperhouse  out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the Horror section-- neither of us had heard of it, but the blurb on the box was really promising. And the movie didnt disappoint, though I still probably wouldnt call it a horror movie exclusively. Give it a chance, you wont regret it! And maybe you should read the book, too#1
7103_7#I was pretty surprised with this flick. Even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good. The acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste. But hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded. I would really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look up Antonella Ríos who is an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting). Antonella Ríos truly is a star on the rise.#1
2463_4#I dont know how to describe this movie. Its definitely one of the weirdest movies Ive seen in a long time. It is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone whos into gore & splatter. I found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes. The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and The Dentist is therefore quite unsettling. My rating 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)#0
11927_10#I have to say despite its reviews Angels in the Outfield was a pretty good movie. I like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen. Unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting. Though I liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy (i.e. Towards the end when Ray Mitchell hits a homer he doesnt step on the plate and therefore that wouldnt be a score. But thats just nitpicking.) I have to say i was really impressed with this movies presence and moral Just have faith, Dont give up.#1
6319_1#This film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if, upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in Cow Dung Collehe, the President was going to immediately change all US foreign policy. It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes#0
11776_4#Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past.If such a film is shown to people again,it would surely click provided if it has something new,fresh and captivating for todays challenging audiences. This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her films principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend.She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format.Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders film,it may well be Krokos involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment.It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows.#0
1087_1#This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. While featuring good actors the movie doesnt live up to the expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors, loud and dramatic music. It doesnt change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. Earned itself a score of 1.#0
2446_10#From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her?! The show not the same as before. Its way worse. The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You cant replace someone from the beginning! That is like South Park without Kyle or Childs Play without Chucky! Its not right! The niece who replaced her is just, ugh! Awful. She doesnt fit into the storyline at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece cant replace her. She was an awesome actress. Way better than the niece. Get her back, or youll lose a TON of viewers.#1
10637_10#Harem Suare is the best film I saw in the year 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Sensually shot and stunningly portrayed, Harem Suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance, which is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes, and color, populate the film. Cut off from the outside world, the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue, rivalry and jealousies within their ranks.#1
10312_10#As long as you go into this movie knowing that its terrible bad acting, bad  effects,  bad story, bad everything, then youll love it. This is one of my favorite  goof on  movies; watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs #1

1952_8#I got to see the movie   On Thin Ice  on the television in India.. I must say the movie was really well done, and really sent a chill down my spine.. the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted A must must watch movie.. for everyone#1
6086_4#For some reason, in the late 70s and early 80s the local CBS affiliated station in New York kept playing this movie in its late-night slot on Friday or Saturday nights for several years, usually at 2 a.m. or some such time. Its a fitting movie for that time slot since its really hard to follow and quite odd (see the other reviews for specific story info). Anyway, after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable TV (And even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming), I kept catching this little oddity. After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Well, it is only available (from every search ive conducted anyway)in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label  Brentwood Video  as part of a 4-pack of movies (4 movies on 2 double sided discs)called  Alien Worlds  if anyone is interested. Its usually available for around $10-but even much less if you shop around. The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies, so no need to comment on them here. But I havent seen  Eyes  available anywhere else. Though hardly a  restored  version in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so for once IMDbs stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct. Even with the 92 minute running time its not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed. It seems to be a common budget-conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story. Would a longer version make in any less confusing? Who really knows-unless youve seen it in its native language By the way, my attempts to watch this during the day dont work and I end up just turning it off. Theres something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie..or maybe its just from my earlier experiences, who know??#0
9216_3#Hoo boy, this was a real trial to get through. The DVD case has Tom Hanks mug plastered on it and that is the only reason that anybody would buy it. He looks about forty on the box, however, the movie was made in 1982, so he still has his Bosom Buddies do and of course is about forty pounds lighter. The plot concerns a Dungeons and Dragons like game that Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks ends up thinking the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is a boy genius named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hats. Ooh,look, he has a yellow hardhat on with a tuxedo! Now hes dressed like a WWI pilot! This was a truly awful movie but in a bad way. A bunch of vets pop up mostly as parents of the kids. Theres Anne (Im Honey West, dammit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually looks kind of hot. Murray Hamilton, the Mayor from Jaws, has a thankless roll as a cop. Wendy Crewson, is the love interest for Hanks and some blonde guy I have never seen before or since. There is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because hes, you know, nuts. The monster is played by the late, great Kevin Peter Hall, he of Predator fame. A friend of mine got this out of the ol discount bin at MallWart and advised me to chuck it in the trash without even looking at it, so naturally I had to see if it was as bad as all that. It was. The night before, I watched Apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a bit of a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the bin. Oh yeah, after Hanks almost jumps from one of the World Trade Center towers because of his delusions, he goes home to recuperate and is visited by his friends. Hanks mother, a drunken Vera Miles, says he is coming along nicely now but when they walk down to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit, he is crazier than ever. The End#0

5273_4#   SPOILERS       SPOILERS    When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. But as most superstation original movies I was left disapointed. This gullible family ends up driving through this  deserted  town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. Their are more gaps than I can count and they dont explain anything that happens how or what. It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is never explained). The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused.#0
11253_9#This is an extremely long movie, which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies. I really enjoyed it in the end. Well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character.#1
8861_9#Says Andy  Nobody gets hurt, everybody wins.  Before he says it, we know the opposite is true Everybody gets hurt, nobody wins. This is a new strand in American movies, or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last. Think  Eastern Promises ,  There Will Be Blood ,  No Country for Old Men . These movies are dark, serious, extremely well made, and dont care about happy endings. I love them.  Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead  fits the general description, but creates an atmosphere all its own. Kelly Mastersons debut script is as close as a Hollywood movie will ever get to a Greek tragedy. Paying tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding, old school character drama. The opening shots, although of an obese accountant doggy-styling his trophy wife, have the look and feel of a Dutch masters painting. By contrast, the drug dealers condo looks more like a string of Mondrians. Great performances all around. Only Albert Finneys character Charles feels a little over-acted, eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time. But then he is in trouble deep, deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But of course you dont need me to tell you that. Why her character Gina would want to be with a guy like Andy, were never told, but thats okay. Action is character, after all. The unique and magic touch of Carter Burwells music makes this fine movie a masterpiece. Dont miss it.#1
10055_7#It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact Even by todays standards, the film is interesting and provocative  Artistically, however, this is perhaps his most complete His later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas  Therese and Isabelle  was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism#1
8377_8#My girlfriend and I have a thing for Robots. So I try to seek out movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big ones. They beat the clang and bang out of each other, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. Its really cool. You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It is very hard to dislike this movie. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that is good enough for me. And special mention must be made of veteran character actor Paul Koslo as the maniacal Russian Villain, whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after theyve already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste  like blood  (a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen. This is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation.#1
2139_9#I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years, especially  Strictly Ballroom . While the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing. It is about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life. He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch.#1
10238_4#This movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning, but never fleshed out to its expectations. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the Asian directors), but doesnt know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it. The story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explainable, interesting angle. Basically, the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases. The acting was very good, however. All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was outstanding as he is always is. It is too bad he chose to do such a weak film.#0
5050_7#We really enjoyed Grey Owl a simple tale well told in classic Attenborough fashion a little over-romanticized, with archetypes, humor, and a stress of dignity and values. Two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the cutest we have ever seen - and the message is a good one with its ecoleanings. It must have been great to meet or read Grey Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute.#1
5478_4#With nothing better to do I decided to check out  Aztec Rex  (as it was being billed) for the hell of it. Disappointing. At least the cast and crew got a free trip to Hawaii, where the movie was filmed.#0
3992_2#Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. In many of films, such  Do The Right Thing,  most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism once again being the entire issue. This is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought- provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.#0
703_10#I rated this a ten just because I find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera. Its no epic but its plenty engaging and I was never bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse, then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know Ill be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release. Damn good job, and well worth the money. What a script! It might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures Ive seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. Serious kudos to her, cant wait to see more.#1
1554_8#I saw this at the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with eerie protective suits. The experienced British soldiers don gas masks (only) and once again await the clouds of gas and the German attackers. The gas clouds move ever closer, finally enveloping the British defenders. The Germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb. Suddenly a scream from the defenders This gas is like no other that they have experienced before.  Now you will know why I have remembered this scene for the last 30+ years and still shiver, I think that you will too!#1
11269_8#Ever wanted to know just how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into effect? Well, unfortunately  Convention City  is lost, so well just have to watch  Tarzan and His Mate  to find out. For 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. Just look at Janes nude swim. While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. Over seventy years later, it is still as sexy as it was when it came out. In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. Ive always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s, but there are few from the genre Id call great films.  Tarzan and His Mate  is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre. The sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today. Also, the animals are all too cool (espescially the apes throwing boulders). The acting wont win any major awards soon, but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture. The film is once again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there.#1
2767_8#Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this film. The last 15 minutes (or thereabouts) are great and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. The same cannot however be said for the rest of the film. Its not awful and Im sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I were to be honest) to see it is Peck. For the rest you are better off just reading the Old Testament.#1
7547_10#Cat Soup at first seems to be a very random animated film. The best way Ive been able to explain it is that its quite acidic. Though its not totally random. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat boy and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very ill and dies, however, Nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieve half of it. The story is about their quest to bring Nyaako fully back to life. Though a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random, it is not. Most of it is symbolism for life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other tales, such as Hansel and Gretal. This strangely cute short film has an interesting story, packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.#1
3905_1#Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama, ineptly directed, scripted, acted, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allendes not-so-much-better novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favourite actress and Jeremy Irons try hard to get over such a terrible script. Plenty of mistakes (like, for example, since when does it snow in Xmas in Chile?) and very cruel, with tons of that evil named  magic realism , this stands out as the worst movie of all time. It totally sucks #0

10973_4#If you loved  Pulp Fiction  and like hand held cameras you should love this film. I liked the quirky story (even though I feel that  Pulp Fiction  was the most over-rated movie since  The English Patient ) and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. Its not  On the Waterfront  or  Citizen Kane  and is burdened by European pretentiousness. But the worst part by far is the hand held camera. It is so distracting and annoying I found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end. I dont know why new directors think this method of filming is so great. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes.#0
685_8#Ghost Story,(The New House) is a terrific horror story. This is from the Circle Of Fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies.The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early family series, Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the lead actors, and as the main characters in the story.I saw this recently,and I was so scared!If you are alone,I would not recommend that you watch this.This story is terrific,no gore or curse words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played her husband.Both actors were very good in their parts.If you like scary, fun,terrifying ghost stories, then you will like this little gem. I gave this a high rating.I highly recommend this story.#1
5738_4# Darkness  was entertaining to some degree, but it never seemed to have a plot, lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this detriment; i.e.  Bad Taste . It started off really good, with a man running from something. It was very creepy for these first few minutes, but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore, which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway. The film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting, which most of the time, seemed like some friends talking to a video camera, making lines up as they went. That, with a lack of any plot whatsoever, made it look like the film was started without, and ended without, a script of any kind. As said before, gore was this films only drawing point, which much of the time was hard to make out.#0

6261_2#A couple move into their dream home, unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery. The film is said to have been based on a true story, although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed. The plot is hardly unique - see Spielbergs Poltergeist (1982). Within a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows, the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control. There is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery, we do not learn anything more. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable, nor is the atmosphere particularly special. The film could be disturbing to some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it.#0
6598_1#This  film  is a travesty. No, wait--an abomination. NO, WAIT--this is without a doubt the absolute WORST film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors. Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have been dead, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. Why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for L & H would be in the persona of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain is beyond me. I tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and I certainly wasnt disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with Hollywood and film-making. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS--YOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED.#0
6012_1#Im not a fan of the Left Behind book series - the books are written at a 6th-grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science, technology, and politics. While the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture, their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous (an example is their explanation for the Russian/Arab invasion of Israel). Also, the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel. Still, I found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of Revelation. For a similar reason, I watched this film adaptation. I am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor. The acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over-acting. The script is rather bad, though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. Events feel scattered and disconnected. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. Here, the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book. The pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed, and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded. The music is schizophrenic. At times, it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture. At other moments, it reminds me of sitcom and mini-series music. And still other bits remind me of a poppy MTV soundtrack that just doesnt belong in the film. I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but thats it. The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling. The film also suffers from the books preachiness although its message isnt quite as in your face. In all, I found the movie just as disappointing as the series. This is not the film to rally Christians around it. I hope that this film does NOT get any attention at the theaters next year. It would be more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity. For an example of a compelling, intelligent, well-researched series based on Revelation that presents a realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader (who after all should be whom a Christian is trying to reach) read the Christ Clone trilogy by James BeauSeigneur. Its a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality.#0
192_2#The only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son Paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lords name in vain in this film being from a Presbyterian background? It doesnt fit. I wished Paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to rescue but doesnt-so what. Its very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real wild western. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two ministers sons have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. Id rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never.#0
5082_7#The Secret Fury, in many ways a run-of-the-mill romantic suspense drama (directed by Mel Ferrer) boasts top-notch principals in Colbert and Ryan; it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end, when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief -- as so often it does in this genre. But for some viewers the films highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy Leah by Vivian Vance -- the immortal Ethel Mertz on  I Love Lucy.  Oddly, Vance had very few film roles; her true home was Broadway, where (among other gigs) she understudied for Ethel Merman. Here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme; watch her half-heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when shes puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotels linen-storage room -- a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty.#1
11476_3#I watched this film on the Hallmark Channel recently. In my opinion, the film started out decent enough, but eventually got sour. Conclusion I became disappointed as the film ran on, and it got worse and worse. I ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because I had enough. So, the film started out decent with some few gem moments, but ended up ruining itself. Therefore, I dont recommend this film to anyone.#0
11072_8#its all very simple. Jake goes to prison, and spends five years with the con and the chess masters. they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure, and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks. they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom from his innermost fears, from what he believes to be himself. for that, they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear, all the pride, all the hope - to be reborn as true master of his will. its a clever movie about the journey of illumination, about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.#1
4811_3#I watched the Canadian videotape of this movie as  The Witching  which somehow made its way to New York State. Audio was quite bad, I had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber. A ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted. Some closed captions would really have helped! Some images in the movie have some impact, but on the whole the movie is not very involving. The movie does seem a bit of a mess, and this is no doubt largely due to its re- editing and the addition of new footage. The original version, according to the end credits, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. The magic of DVD could let us see both versions on one disc, but re-releasing this movie probably isnt a priority.#0
6543_9#I read all of Nancy Drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown-up. I loved the effect used at the end (and a little bit at the beginning) of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie. It was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books. For example, the scenes with the Oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios I remember from the books. I thought Ned was perfectly cast, and Emma Roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of Nancy Drew. (Just like the picture of Betty Crocker, she keeps up with the times!)#1
3944_3#The film My Name is Modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the 10th modesty Blaise novel called Night of the Morningstar. It describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book, mid twenties in the film)asserts her leadership in a war over a casino. As this is set before the actual Blaise adventures her trusted sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the film. That is one of the main problems as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip. The other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay. The casting is okay but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young Modesty. I get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.#0
8115_1#This movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure, and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it, and didnt have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! Admittedly, the storyline was decentbut i found the acting terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, i thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight, without her, i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film. Every time i hear somebody say  daarling  i cringe! i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said  it . It made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life! (i apologise if this has offended anybody, i am only expressing my opinion)#0
3186_8#I find this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easily digestible, the humour is light and clean, and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common, I find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out. Turns out to be very nice. The performance of the female lead is admirable; her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to Davids sophisticated role was very charming. I also find Veras dancing very, very well done. I find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly. For those who have had enough of profanity-filled movies of today, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly.#1
1783_2#There are no spoilers here Because there is no plot to spoil. Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting-- no talent required. The only bright spot are a few really good one-liners delivered very nicely by Alice Krige, but then again, she IS Alice Krige. Her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be. She is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot. How they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery. The screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script. It has major continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, horror formula writing, and simply falls short of making any sense what-so-ever. The creatures, while they have neat skills like going  dim , the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored.  Dont waste any time on this one.#0
5606_1#I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. Me thinks he (the lady) doth protest too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He sites profane literature (writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible) a number of times however I can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. Anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesnt make it true. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look at English & German where it is very obviously a common root) nothing stays the same, its always growing and changing. The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one Ive found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by the translators and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse changes. Writings from around the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs & without numeric verses. These writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. For example how would you read this GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here? Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. This is why many biblical researchers use a Lexicon to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. Its also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He doesnt exist! In the end I just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty. Talk about ego! Putting soapbox away, God Bless Maegi#0
1013_9#Stargate SG-1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate. In the Stargate universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goauld such as Ra and Apophis. For millennia, the Goauld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures. As a result, Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs, Mayans, Britons, the Norse, Mongols, Greeks, and Romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy. Many well-known mythical locations such as Avalon, Camelot, and Atlantis are found, or have at one time existed. The parasitic Goauld use advanced technology to cast themselves as Egyptian Gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. Throughout the first eight seasons, the Goauld are the primary antagonists. They are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. The original arch-enemy from this race was the System Lord Apophis (Peter Williams). Other System Lords, such as Baal and Anubis, play pivotal roles in the later seasons. In the ninth season a new villain emerges, the Ori. The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. The introduction of the Ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on Egyptian mythology into an exploration of the Arthurian mythology surrounding the Ori, their followers, and their enemiesthe Ancients.#1
7708_1#The only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man-eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume  Can somebody please pass the ketchup?  I highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative; it works better than an overdose of demarol.#0
3039_8#Frank McCarthy who produced the Academy Award winning biographical film Patton follows it up with a strong tribute to another of Americas fighting generals, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his egotism. With MacArthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended. MacArthur was also grandly eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender, at MacArthurs farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreels and see if you dont agree.#1
271_1#I cannot believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. I have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I really wouldnt even consider this true sci-fi. Every episode I have sat through was like a lame, watered down version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting. Also, unlike the great new  Battlestar Galactica  series,  Stargate  copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely! They should have at least updated the cheesy  toilet flushing  special effect of whenever somebody goes through the Stargate.#0
6877_7#Just finished watching The Groove Tube which I first saw about 23 years ago when I was a teenager staying up way past my bedtime watching HBO with my brother and his best friend. We had also watched Animal House just before that so we saw two movies that starred an SNL alumna and had some naked breasts. Good thing our parents were asleep the whole time! Anyway, there were lots of weird and funny things in this movie that were eye-openers like the Brown 25 sequence of the Uranus Industries commercial ( with the taste of beef stew  says the announcer as what is apparently human excrement comes out of a white tube. Ewww!) or the face of the puppet talking about VD (a scrotum with a small penis with eyes glued on). Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer made their feature film debuts here. Chase is hilarious whether doing a Geritan spot with a woman stripping, having his hands have sex in a  Let Fingers Do It  commercial, or singing  Four Leaf Clover  with co-writer/director Ken Shapiro drumming his hands on his head. Belzer teams with Shapiro in  The Dealers  movie, and on  Channel One Evening News  with one wild bit having Belzer as a black prostitute trying tricks on reporter Ken who plays Lionel here.  Lionel, that sounds like a train that Im going to ride like a Choo-Choo!  Other outrageous bits include  The Koko Show  with Shipiro as a kid clown show host who, after ordering the  people over ten  to leave the room, reads requests of his viewers like passages of  Fanny Hill   Or how about the Olympics segment with a German couple making love being announced by two men (one of them Spanish) as they get explicit while  Please Stand By  keeps interrupting on the screen! Or the animated segment on  The Dealers  which depicts dancing toilets after Shapiro ingested some marijuana! Not everythings so dirty. Besides the  Four Leaf Clover  skit, at the end theres a highly amusing music segment with Ken lip-syncing his own recording of  Just You, Just Me  while dancing with suit and briefcase around the city with occasionally a cop (co-writer Lane Sarasohn) joining in. So, in summation this is one weirdly, funny movie that seemed to influence other like films (Tunnelvision, Kentucky Fried Movie) and possibly Saturday Night Live (which made Chevy that shows first star) and, despite some dated elements, can still amuse today. P.S. While I liked hearing Curtis Mayfields  Move On Up  during the gorillas dancing/hitchhiking beginning sequence, I did wonder what the point was with the sequence of the hitchhiker and the woman who picked him up, having them running from the car, stripping on the run, and then having the naked man get caught by the cop who stopped on the road. Guess its one of those 70s streaking things#1
9040_9#A true wholesome American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal mining town, after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Why arent pictures like this recognized more at award times?#1
665_3#In Bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.

10731_7#I notice the DVD version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the FRF and the launch.  The DVD I have watched feels edited for television.#1
2684_1#Ive found the movie offensive for Americans which lost somebody in the towers, for American people in general. Pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years, each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts (which have none to do with a terrorist attack), or criticize Americans political behaviour, or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of September 11. Shame on them.#0
11767_4#I had somewhat high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth. I was not pleased with this film. I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it. First I was very disappointed with John Hurts performance here. He looks as if his eyebrows were re-shaped for this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The Gama thing didnt really stick to the original story line I dont think. I guess the best part of the film was the end. It had some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why?. Now I know. I was hoping to to get blown away, but I was not.#0
4610_4#I watched this film because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the cast. I have long had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but never seems to get to prove that, because she is always in this sort of low-budget B movie. She is still beautiful, and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material I always see her in. This is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that doesnt make it good. George Wendt played against type, and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role. Another note about Ms. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last. Perhaps reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants. This NOT a bad thing. She still looks great. I would like to see her in a better movie.#0
876_4#Up until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is possibly Jackie Chans worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work, which I am not familiar with). The final fight sequence changed all that it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of Chans career. But to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of  comedy  that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guys face) and endless  football  scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line  How can I turn it off? Its not a tap  - watch to find out what it refers to).  Dragon Lord  is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those whove already seen at least 15 of his other movies. (  )#0
9593_10#First of all I am a butch, straight white male. But even with that handicap I love this movie. Its about real people. A real time and place. And of course New York City in the 80s. I had many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them. No matter what the consequences. Thats courageous. You have to admire that. This is a great film, watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in the New York of the eighties. Its real life. Bottom line its real life.#1
4582_7#I do find it a bit overrated. Maybe its just because Ive never seen a subtitled version (dubbing stinks!), but I just dont get into it like a lot of other people do. The finale is really great though as Jackie trashes a mall, a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping!#1
8358_9#Not so many people like the movies of Bertrand blier simply because they dont understand them. Simply because they are different kinds of people. SO, les valseuses is much better a name than going places. To dance a valse you need to be elegant, but going places you dont.#1
9850_1#I felt brain dead, Ill tell you. This is the worst film I have ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought this was the Peter Jackson film of the same name). The performances are so terrible they are laughable. The special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire. The script promotes that kind of TV movie, stare into the middle distance kind of acting. The cast look as if they have been taking lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have one look each, and stick to it. Plus I have never been confused by a movie until I sat down to watch this. The is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes. Avoid like a plague.#0
7175_4#This may have been based on historical events, and we know that the makers of this TV docu-drama took liberties to make it more dramatic - I can live with that - but it was just so badly done! I was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid-air crisis how calm everyone seemed, surely someone would have panicked, and what a smooth flight, no passenger discomfort apparent - come on! Not sure about the regulations, nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems OTT nonsense, but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing, common sense tells me this is not a good idea! The shots of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake. In reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby, in this movie it was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was. Escape slides appeared at the front and mid emergency doors, yet nobody appeared to exit from the front, even though the drop was much less. The Captain went back into the plane after the landing - why? this was never explained. We know the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel, but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger, yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely, and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far away as possible, as I am sure I would have done. There were just too many inconsistencies, errors and faked action in this. I would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time, and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed. It had the potential to be quite thrilling, but doubtless due to the budget restrictions failed, and made one feel that a plane losing all engines was no big deal really, and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing, but no real danger! - the reality of course being somewhat different!#0
9120_10#This film speaks a universal language; one can relate it to the self, community, society or the wider world. It has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction / ownership. The portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction, the opposing force of innovation, creativity and growth. The factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled. The Idea, is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into ones internal voice / conscience through the looking, it makes one feel as opposed to just watch.#1
5225_9#I think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best National Lampoons films, it also has a very catchy spoof title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about. Men In White  The story is a spoof of many films including a Will Smith film, as you might have guessed, Men In Black. I will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (Garbage Cans). Also, they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The acting is not superb, actually, it is not very good, but that is what makes the film funny, it is a comedy, loosen up  I love the story line, partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (Or should it be Un-subtle) they rip off all the other films. I am great fan of un-serious spoof films, but i am also a fan of the real thing, and with this films, it is hard to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, but this film carries it off successfully. The two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called Little Britain. This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best storyline, National Lampoons film to date #1
3878_10#ROUEN PRIZES AND THE TRIUMPH OF  VILLA PARANOIA  The favorite film of the general public, actually more important than the jury prize, was Erik Clausens brilliant bittersweet dramatic comedy,  Villa Paranoia , which was also selected by the European Youth Jury indicative of its appeal to cinephiles of all ages. The following day director-actor Clausen traveled to the remote Town of MAMERS, Pays de Loire, for a provincial festival of new European cinema, where  Villa Paranoia  picked up three more prizes -- Best film, Professional Jury; Best Film, Audience prize; and Best film of another youth jury composed of  lycéens , French high school students. Five prizes in a single weekend -- not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown actors. In addition,  Villa  was awarded the Grand Prix, the MAVERICK SPIRIT AWARD, at San Jose, California, just a week ago, by distinguished British actor Sir Ben Kingsley ( Ghandi ), making for a grand total of six prizes in a single week. If Lars van Trier has put Denmark on the offbeat-oddball Dogma Cinematic map in recent years, there is now a good chance that Veteran Maverick Erik Clausen (62) and his capable crew of actors will soon show the world that Denmark has more to offer than dogmatic drivel, which is to say, a mass audience pleaser for young and old alike. Moreover, the female lead of his film, Sonja Richter, has such a magical screen presence that, with a little more exposure, she stands a good chance of becoming the next international Scandinavian Diva. For the record,  Villa Paranoia  is a fiction film, written, directed and acted in by Mr. Clausen, and employing certain motifs from Molieres  The Imaginary Invalid . Anna (Richter), an ambitious young actress, has lost a deeply coveted role in the Moliere play and, reduced to making an utterly stupid TV chicken commercial, is on the verge of suicide. However, Jorgen (Clausen) who runs a massive chicken farm sponsoring the spot, offers her a job with room and board taking care of his cantankerous, senile, wheel-chair ridden father, Walentin, who has not spoken a word since his wife Stella committed suicide years before. Anna is the only one who eventually finds a way of communicating with the hostile silent old grouch -- and moreover, discovers that he has been faking deafness and immobility all these years -- a living  Malade Imaginaire . This will lead to her playing the greatest role of her own life in order to uncover the dark secret which led to Walentins total withdrawal from life and reality. Villa  Paradise-Paranoia , true to the Moliere tradition from which it is partially derived, is a heartwarming, multi-layered, serial-comic psycho-drama that literally has something for everybody and only needs proper placement to attain the kind of general international outreach it richly deserves. Alex Deleon, Paris / 21 MARCH, 2005#1
4240_1#As we all know Hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those hollywoodized movies. For example the bank robbers never did go back in the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD yet in the movie we see them go back inside twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who were shot near the end of the movie, this is far from the truth! But of course Hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they  add  some more blood and guts. Some events were combined and many of the lead actors played several different people but this is what Hollywood has always done so why complain? I guess the only sad part is that I have watched some one hour documentaries about the North Hollywood shootout on TLC that were far better then this!#0
4525_1#Some nice scenery, but the story itself--in which a self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and, in the course of doing Egyptologist things in the most un-Egyptologistic of ways (e.g., flash photography in the tombs, the handling of old parchment, etc.), uncovers a black market turf war and somehow (in the span of two days, no less!) becomes that wars jumpsuit-wearing epicenter--is more puzzling than any riddle the Sphinx ever posed. Down is simply awful as the visiting British scholar (that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers, certainly; but that shes annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely), and the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seem as downright confused by the proceedings as I was. In short, not what youd expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and co.  Note to would-be Egyptologists take a year or two of Arabic in grad school. Itll really help out in the long run#0
1122_1#The acting is some of the worst Ive ever seen, the characters are totally unconvincing. This could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting, which the plot to  The Prodigy  was not. Its sort of a bad mix between  Fresh  and  Animal House , except that both of those movies were good.#0

11930_2#Times are tough for Angel Town, gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (Mainly due to embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid, Martine to join the gangs, so they beat him up everyday. However due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier  Worlds lamest actor  Gruner) named Jacques, hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made (And Ive seen my share) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need, are French kick-boxers who cant act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments its just truly hilarious. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit  You like the fighting? (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock) I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason why I dont want him dead is because im afraid of him, and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me, thats why he doesnt die!     out of 4-(Bad)#0
8138_2# The Bat People  is a proud resident of the IMDb Bottom 100. Every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list, depending on whether there are new movies with Paris Hilton in the lead or documentaries about American Idol stars, but it always reliably returns sooner or later. And why? Because, unlike the majority of crap in that list,  The Bat People  is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz! This nearly isnt the worst film ever made, since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity, but its still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing. The script is incredibly boring, with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity, and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film. Other than a sensible screenplay, the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make-up effects  although courtesy of a young Stan Winston  are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film. The films title is inaccurate, as  people  refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one Bat Person. Much more than Bruce Wayne, the real Batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine Bat-cave and a Bat-mobile (a stolen ambulance)! The plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon-weekend exploring caves. They wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animals vicious attack. Worried that he might be infected with rabies, he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital, but still this doesnt prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature. He kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment. Sure, honey! The script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come John always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat-guano. So basically,  The Bat People  is a variation on the good old werewolf-theme, but obviously not a very interesting one. The concept showed a lot of potential, but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted Sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters. Some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive, the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy, theres a nice bit of gore during the climax (finally!) and main actress Marianne McAndrew is ravishing to look at (though not to listen to). This truly bad and boring films current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80, and personally I hope it sticks somewhere in that region. The list simply wouldnt feel and traditional without  The Bat People .#0
7168_4#The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable. Basic elements such as character development were glossed over, at best. Inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Characters just  showing up  in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, I might add)? All in all it wasnt  bad . I rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.#0
9088_8#When we talk Hollywood Hotel we could be talking about one of three things, the actual hotel, the radio program, and this film which was partially inspired by the first two. Dick Powell was the host of the Hollywood Hotel program on CBS radio network in which Louella Parsons dished out the weekly scoop on the stars. Hollywood Hotel is one delightful and entertaining motion picture, dated, but charmingly so.#1
2101_7#Forget Neo and Bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes. They only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes. Since they cannot be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick. I exited the theater room very pleased, and hungry for more.#1
1765_8#Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20s along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than Crashers. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrells character Andy and Catherine Keeners character Trish will go to, it isnt too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both. The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudds being the funniest). The big laughs come through because of Carrells reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth. Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like Crashers, there isnt as much that doesnt make sense character wise). For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, Carrell gets very high points here. And like with a Farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the waxing scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise). But if youre willing not to get offended by it, theres more where that came from. This is one of the funniest films of the year.#1
8896_10#Can any one help find out the title and artist of the song, that was played at least halfway through the movie. I cant remember what scene was playing. The words in the song are of a ballad. Some of the lyrics go like   Its natures way of telling you somethings wrong.  Its natures way of telling it in a song.   Its natures way of forgiving you.  Please Help me with this question. Thanks so much! I have been searching the internet for days, I cant get this song out of my mind. So now this will challenge me to find some one out there who may be able to help mer with this matter. I wish I would of been paying attention to the scene, when it was playing.#1
3068_9#I gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable. Well, I paid to see it in a theatre, and Im glad I did because visually it was a striking film. Most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s (except for the shrinks office, which was dated in a different way), and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequences out, the whole film has a washed- out early 60s ambience. And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating. For a first-time director whose background, I believe, is in writing, he has a great eye. Within the first ten minutes I felt the plot lacked plausibility, so I just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride. In terms of acting and the depiction of father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relationships, the film was spot-on. William H. Macy, a pleasure to watch, seems to be filling the void left by the late Tony Perkins, if this and Magnolia are any indication. Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving, to me. It was a three-dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals. The depiction of the parents (Bain/Sutherland) reminded me, in an indirect way, of Vincent Gallos BUFFALO 66, although toned-down quite a bit! I would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director. He has the self-discipline of a 50s b-crimefilm director (something P.T.Anderson will never have!), yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention.#1
11352_1#this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities Maybe it held some fascination in the 3D dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while. Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up well, I agree with an above review - this is like a cold-war propaganda story. Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. BTW - why were all the main character flies deformed? - not one had the full compliment of limbs!#0
5993_2#I grew up (b. 1965) watching and loving the Thunderbirds. All my mates at school watched. We played  Thunderbirds  before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Counting down from 5 became an art form. I took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only high point was the snappy theme tune. Not that it could compare with the original score of the Thunderbirds. Thankfully early Saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series Gerry Anderson and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes should hand in his directors chair, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of film. Utter rubbish. A CGI remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a huge error of judgment.#0
12282_8#At first I didnt didnt like it that much, although I did. They didnt include the third Trueba generation, the love between Blanca and Pedro wanst well explained and some actors were too different from what I had imagined. The movie is really good, specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book. Its amazing how many famous stars are there, dont you think so?#1
3202_1#If you ever hear these three words uttered to you Joe Don Baker , be afraid Its so hard to imagine how he was in THREE Bond moviesvery weird! Anyway, if youre up for a laugh, then see this one on MST3K sometime. Also, Ive heard his other bad movie (among many),  Mitchell  MST3K version is being released on DVD by Rhino. I cant wait to see that #0
28_10#And heres yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the Italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror. Emilio Miraglias  The Red Queen Kills Seven Times  is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences. Its a fabulous giallo (released in the golden year 1972) that belongs in the top-five of every fan of Italian cinema. The storyline doesnt just introduce your average black-gloved & sexually frustrated killer, but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous  Red Queen . At young age, their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings Kitty and Evelyn about an uncanny lady who, once every 100 years on April 6th, kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim. Fourteen years later, Kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing spree begins. Sister Evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the States recently Or has she? Complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the Red Queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history. Her face can never be seen, but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim. Shes not exactly gentle either, as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger, dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences! That latter one is truly one of the greatest (= most gruesome) acts of violence Ive ever seen! What more could you possibly request? Some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? The gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them Barbara Bouchet and a young Sybil Danning. Emilio Miraglia isnt the most famous giallo-director, as he only made this one and the equally recommended  The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave , but his influence and importance should NOT be forgotten.#1
8787_8#This film enhanced my opinion of Errol Flynn. While Flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin European terms!), this film gives him an opportunity to stretch (albeit only slightly) as an actor, as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. The supporting cast is excellent; everyone seems well-chosen for their roles. The story moves briskly and, while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also reasonably faithful to history. I also really liked the great depictions of 1880s San Francisco. All in all, theres little not to like about this filmvery well worth the time to watch it.#1
3818_8#Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film-making world after a multi-year absence. Having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt, he recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable (Cannes-winning) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae. What follows is a journey through one womans tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms. All the same, the film still stands quite impressive, especially in that it stimulated me to think about it, the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy, coping, self-deception, isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running. Propelled by a strong lead performance, I honestly didnt notice its 2.25 hour runtime. And that says something. Well done. 8/10.#1

285_3#Its not really about gymnastics; swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery, or microbiology, or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead, like every other Rocky/Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market, its about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness, rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course. Ronald Reagan top to bottom, in short; so as a piece of cinema its down to the details. Some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest, brought to you by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, warming up for Ted; heroine Olivia DAbos hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses/teammates, one of whom appears to be made of porcelain. Its my instinct to be appalled by the comic-relief black guys, but on the other hand at least theyre in the movie. But DAbo doesnt quite convince with her awkward-girl shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter; its all just bodies hurtling around, and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion, its all performed by an obvious double.#0

1410_9#EARTH (2009)    1/2 Big screen adaptation of the BBC/Discovery Channel series  Planet Earth  offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw-dropping moments of  how the hell did they get this footage?!  while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel (witness a Great White Shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal!) and adorable (the various babies and their rents). The basso profundo tones of narrator James Earl Jones solidifies its Gods eye views and profundity. Culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage, the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the IMAX format and couldve even gone longer! Oh, well, theres always the next time (since Disney Studios has produced this count on a series of more to come). Dirs Alastair Fothergill & Mark Linfield.#1
12438_8#The movie was a long awaited release, which where a bit disappointing because of the expectations I had set up. When looking at it again I must say it is actually pretty OK. First of all is it very true to the original history (of course not completely) and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie. Modestys history as a child is shown and is very true to the original. The acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin, but when you compare it to the 1966 Vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical. Generally would I only recommend it to fans of Modesty Blaise or to someone who by catch it on the TV.#1
3959_1#this, is NOT one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe I have ever scene, the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without the sex, the only reason I bought this was I wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one I could find, possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever, the soundtrack is REALLY tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films, why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me, if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed I would be nicer in this review but they dont they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students, DO NOT buy this movie. the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER unbelievable GARBAGE! 0/10 if only the voting system would allow that.#0
5340_8#Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the film, essentially a film about a Spanish/American girl who moves to Spain with her mom at the time of the Spanish Civil War. It turns out, the mother goes home to die, and she is left with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences much in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is at first a nuisance to her then they become close. The film is shot beautifully, bathed in soft colors mostly. Carol yearns for her dad, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel the love sher has for him. While the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film, it envelops the characters lives. I think youll like it. See it especially for Clara Lago, who does a great job as Carol. She is definitely one to watch.#1
2729_10#I voted excellent for how well the acting was, not for the content. It still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the familys remains are found by the daughters church friend. The blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills. That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.#1
2740_1#I still dont know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This  film  wasnt worth the Memorex DVD-R it was burned on; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents camcorder. This is by far the worst movie ever made. I truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life. This suckfest runs about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, its 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this  film  is the DVD cover, so next time youre near the Wal-Mart DVD bargain bin, take a look at it-- DONT TOUCH IT, just look-- and quietly walk away.#0
3768_3#Thats right. A movie written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and family. (Fred should have known better, having worked the sets of Titantic and Dogma.)  You check it out though; its good for some unintentional laughs.#0
12_1#All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about its redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.#0
10397_2#Simply not the quality I expected from Morris (love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is very much like a not so bad student film. What concerns me, in all this is WHY DID IT WIN A BAFTA??? Morris makes fun of enshrined mediocrity (Ayn Rand) in much of his work (Nathan Barley) and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining!  I just hope as he has chosen a subject I would love to tackle (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that he isnt going to cock that up, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena.#0

11482_1#It, at all, you have seen when harry met sally, then avoid this one. It will not only make you bang your head on the table as why cant bollywood even make a good remake; but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it. The charm of the movie is missing. Ranee looks terrible. Saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor. The plots that have been picked up from the original, dont look effective either. The part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note, it just doesnt look appealing. What can be more disastrous? you wanna waste some money, this is what you can get. Otherwise, put some more bucks, and watch the original. Its too good to miss..#0
5550_7#are highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of  fisher folk.  My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not a great Picford film, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and is good as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldnt spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very effective.#1
11983_4#Marie Dressler carries this Depression-era drama about a kindly bank owner, which recently aired on TCM during their April Fools comedy month. If you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the Dressler-Polly Moran team, youll be disappointed, as this is really a very downbeat film. Its also very poorly made, surprisingly so considering it came from MGM. Leonard Smiths bare bones cinematography is strictly from the set up the camera and dont move it school, frequently to the detriment of the cast, who find themselves delivering lines off screen (its like a pan and scan print before such existed!) or having their heads cut off. The film doesnt even have a credited director, underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production. Overall, its an unsatisfying mess, with Dressler frequently over-emoting and only that bizarre, final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart.#0
2176_1#Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencias comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that arent laughing. If theres anybody whos insecure, its a comedian who wont shut up about his audience.

3773_1#When people ask me whats the worst movie Ive ever seen its this one. Its not even close to MST3k level riffing, or midnight viewing at a theatre, or even as Disney channel late night filler. The only time Ive ever wanted to jump off a ride at Disney World (or Disney/MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Traceys jacket off the mannequin, rip it to shreds, and ram it down the tour guides throat saying  Eat this! Eat this unholy coat of darkness   Ive never been so mad at a movie, not even  Nutty Professor II The Klumps  or  Flash Gordon . You want pretty colors and cinematography? Aint here babe. Reviewers keep saying  oh, but its too look like a comic book , well, to me, its the color of a Gordito after several weeks in the sun. About as enjoyable too. Beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch, himself, and occasional at the other actors, hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting. To be fair, I have only seen this movie once, but my pain threshold is that of a man, not a God.#0
7317_2#Having read the other comments on this film, I would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total Brooksophile. I am not. Fans of  Modern Romance  will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it. To you I say-----there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment.#0
10830_1#1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they hyped up THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA which is by far the worst movie of the year. What is it about? Who the heck knows. Its full of self-indulgence and loaded with bad acting. I always like to stay and watch the credits, but when this thing was over I couldnt get out of the movie theatre fast enough. Most of the audience that attended the showing that I was at, felt pretty much the same way. Dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers. Its an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful.#0
5878_10#Garam Masala is one of the funniest film Ive seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is Amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan has delivered great Movies in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul being some of the Best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made. The three newcomer actresses are average. Rimi sen doesnt get much scope in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with loads of Laughs, this is one Non stop Entertainer.#1
8823_8#Good film. Tells a boyish fantasy story, telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently. Or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you are to break one. If you wanted to express love for someone you dont know, how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation? Also its about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life, of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats. What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice. Are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self. Do we have to listen to the NRJ shouting, see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee?#1
6667_8#OK. There are people who should not see this movie. The rest of you, run, dont walk, to see _Mystery Men_. Its funny, its quirky, its a delightful sendup of every bad superhero cliche known to man. Occasional forays into junior-high humour dont ruin the tongue-in-cheek low-key fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller, and Hank Azaria, as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Good to see Louise Lasser getting work, too.) I laughed all the way through. Utterly unserious, somewhat weird, but -good-.#1
7152_1#Based on a self-serving novel by one-time girl friend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be-drunk-or-be-damned alcoholic; in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgeralds Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie. Virtually every 20th Century-Fox movie made during Daryll F. Zanucks leadership, as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King, was a work of excellence. Beloved Infidel was the exception.#0
2305_1#This movie made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition to that have always trusted & respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles,  Grand Canyon  for example. I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama & not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love to watch white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) became a waste of my $1 credit at the video store.#0
6702_8#Even though there are no new episodes, and it is rarely showed. I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I never got to see the last episodes, but I do want to know what happened to Miles, or Josh? And why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good?Im sure the ending went to be perfect. But there are a lot of questions unanswered. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard she decides between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope that she picks Harvey! And may I say Nate Richart is HOTT  Too bad hes too old for me though. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show, but there are many little  stupid  things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening, its kind of stupid. Plus the cat starts to really get lame, as the show continued, the jokes began just to get stupid, and the things that the audio controlled  audience  would laugh at, I would think it was so lame. Dont get me wrong, at some parts it was funny, but I think the show just kind of lost its  magic  so to speak as the show went on. I give kudos to all the cast though for trying, although that Soleil Moon Frye girl had no taste, and she was a horrid actress. I wonder what Melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter, now that the show has ended.#1
9964_10#Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to come by, the length is now standard and youve gone long enough without it. (When home video started, there were at LEAST three versions with parts missing..) Everything youve read is true. There is no defending it, and no living without it. The color is lush and wonderful to look at, and the production values are pretty good for a Saturday afternoon kiddie epic. But no question..the whole Santa Vs. Satan angle is so jaw dropping STRANGE it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult fave once home video really got underway. How good/bad/strange/ is it? I only saw the TRAILER as a kid,and remembered IT for nearly 30 years..including Murrays over the top voice over..I told my older sister, and she called me a liar and could not believe it was POSSIBLE for ANYONE to make a movie where Santa vs.Satan.. Add to it stuff like Santa asking for the Virgin Marys blessing before setting off on Christmas eve, kids wanting to capture him and make him their SLAVE..and an international kiddie sweat shop..and it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the 60s.. Like others here, I watch the thing every holiday season now. (My version of choice is The Mystery Science Theatre 3000 edition). But any old way you choose it, the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must (along with Brianiac, by the way..).It never fails to make me laugh. Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS. Parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out.(How many parents do YOU know go out for cocktails on Christmas Eve?  If you get bored, just go downstairs and play the piano.  DANG..) Freaky, boring, disturbing, funny, childish, strange..hey, what more can you want?#1
6679_8#I make just one apology for this film there are far, far, too many wide angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond endurance, fair enough. They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so. But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, I had ceased to care. This is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily. Its hilarious, its witty, the comic delivery of ALL of the cast is flawless, and however much Usher peers at his characters through a cold, fish-eye lens - HE may not care for them much - he manages to present them with warmth. `Mystery Men is, in fact, not only funnier, not only more clever, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given it credit for being. The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for instance, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. The satire of `Mystery Men bites when theres something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isnt. It doesnt mock just any old thing. Which is why, contrary to what some (I must regard them as unobservant) critics have said, it never runs out of ideas. The `super heroes are an attractive bunch. Sure, theyre second-rate, but theyre not merely second rate. The Blue Rajah, for instance, does nothing but throw cutlery at people, and he isnt THAT good at it. On the other hand, neither is he comically bad. Hes better in his limited field than most people, and he DOES practise diligently. Hes not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than if he was. If Superman is Christ in a cape, the Mystery Men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus, in capes. Much funnier; also much more endearing.#1
2661_2#German nut case Jörg Buttgereit apparently has fans - but I dont know why, and Im Definitely not one of them! The only Buttgereit film Id seen previously was Nekromantik and I hated every minute of it, but - shockingly - this film is worse! Der Todesking is pointless in the same way as Nekromantik, but its a worse film because its boring in a way that few movies have ever managed (its not far off The Blair Witch Project, seriously). Some people say that this film is sick and shocking, but it really isnt. The director may have been making a point about death, but only he knows what it is. How anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me. The film revolves around the theme of suicide, and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week. Yes, that means we have a pointless and boring episode for Monday, a pointless and boring episode for Tuesday, a pointless and boring episode for Wednesday etc etc. This film manages to be even more boring than my average week!  Der Todesking is apparently an art film, although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to art. Each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story - but it doesnt! We just get a quick little sketch on suicide, and it only makes you wonder what the point is. The film feels like it should be deep, but theres a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it. Buttgereit uses a few evocative images; but Im unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just isnt that memorable. Theres a shot involving a decomposing mans body that features fairly often, but that gets old pretty quick and all youre left with is the rest of the film, which is unfortunate. If I were to struggle for good things to say about this crap, all I can think of is this; the title sounds cool. As I mentioned, Nekromantik is the only other film Ive seen from this amateur director; I have copies of Schramm and Nekromantik 2, and now Im really in no rush to watch either. Der Todesking is a dull film with no point and anyone that calls it art is very much mistaken. Give it a miss.#0
10359_1#The  Wrinkle in Time  book series is my favorite series from childhood. I have read and re-read them more times than I can count over the last 35+ years. The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are near and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual story that I love so much. To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement. I, like another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind.#0
1798_1#How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just dont get it. Trick or Treat managed to do it. This sucks and likes it. Trick or Treat = so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it. That simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film.#0
3025_1#this film is really bad. no i mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time. what appalled me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson. all in all this film is bad. thats it. 1/10.j.d Seaton#0
3518_10#Drum scene is wild! Cook, Jr. is unsung hero of this and many movies. Fantastic actor, great flick. A few twists that keep you moving. A must-see.#1
2792_10#I love this movie. It is great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist-type issues, such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men. It shows the struggles of both an Indian person wanting to break outside her cultural barriers and women wanting to break outside the gender restrictions found in sports, especially in England at the time. I feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues. In contrast to the other comment, I do not think this movie is anything like Dirty Dancing or any other such chick flick. This move is loved by many types of people, men and women, young and old alike.#1
2315_10#There is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed. Robert Mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its best.#1
7373_8#Before the regular comments, my main curiosity about THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG is that while theres a running time listed on IMDb of 94 minutes, the DVD from Wellspring Media in the United States runs 88 minutes. Any input on this is appreciated! #1
2909_4#Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is a little like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist it just doesnt work. I had a really hard time accepting this.Not that I dont think Tom cant act he can Ive been following his career since Mazes and Monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me. Maybe because Im such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)The movie as a whole fails for me.The additions Jude Law, and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones. There are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images Paul Newman is as usual excellent and I really did enjoy the score, But Tom as  the angel of death  Sullivan was completely flat.#0
6456_1#Well, what can it be said about this disaster? I watched it because it aired on cable. I regret for wasting my time but at least I didnt waste money.  Avoid this one at all costs, please. The only  positive  thing about this trash are the sexy women.#0
5792_10#This movie is the only movie to feature a scene in which Michael Jackson wields a Tommy Gun. Plain and simple. Think about it, Joe Pesci and Jacko with Tommy guns, throwing coins into jukeboxes from 20 feet away? Whats not to like? As stated before, THIS MOVIE ROCKS                    !    #1
1234_10#I grew up watching this movie ,and I still love it just as much today as when i was a kid. Dont listen to the critic reviews. They are not accurate on this film.Eddie Murphy really shines in his roll.You can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.I recommend this movie to everybody to see. It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.With demons ,dragons,and a little bald kid with God like powers.This movie takes you from L.A. to Tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in Tibet.Just a beautiful view! So go do your self a favor and snatch this one up! You wont regret it!#1
12457_8#Short synopsis  Anyone who expects the old in-an-out  of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film. For those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience, full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks, although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake.#1
3646_8#Walt Disneys  The Rookie  is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history, ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35. But overall,  The Rookie  is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8/10#1
10068_8#This movie was excellent. A sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie. You have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way, Doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This equals on big happy movie in the end. This movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be, so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture. The cinema-photography is excellent, in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers. Bound to be in Oscar contention for best foreign film.#1
1385_3# Hak Hap , or  Black Mask  (in english) was a disappointment. I was told that it was a sort of  Japanese version of the Matrix . Imagine my disappointment. The film was either badly dubbed or the soundtrack didnt time well with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad. There was very little thought put into the English version of this film and it appeals only to the  senseless action  genre. Not a film I would want to see again.#0
7354_7#I first saw this film over 25 years ago on British TV and have only just caught up with it again last week on a DVD copy bought off ebay. I had remembered the musical sequences, the colour and the gorgeous fashion plate poses and clothes but the plot is weaker than the earlier Anna Neagle/Michael Wilding film Spring in Park Lane and Maytime doesnt stand up so well to the passage of the years. But Michael Wilding is a joy in the film, charming, funny, debonair, appears to be having great fun and on top of his form. Worth watching for him alone. Anna Neagle appears a little matronly beside him, and a little too old for the part she plays but by the end of the 1940s their film partnership was well established with the cinema going public. Spring in Park Lane had been a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker. In his autobiography Wilding wrote at length of his great regard for Herbert Wilcox the director and instigator of this London series of films.#1
7480_3#We all know whats like when we have a bad day at the office, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks at what its like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. Sometimes, its just not worth going, know what I mean? And, sometimes, its just not worth doing something when its already been done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis and much better also. So, naturally, the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hence, this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy, this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon. If youve seen the latter, then definitely dont bother with this one.#0
4709_9#Okay - Ill confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney, with charm to spare. There are a few minor flaws - but its probably the best of the spoofs. Some come close, but none of them are quite this good.#1
1885_10#This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently I was happy to see it on DVD which is a relief from watching the old, grainy VHS versions. This, the original  Arthur , is a classic comedy that is one for the books.#1
717_1#It was meant to be a parody on the LOTR-Trilogy. But this was one of the most awful movies Ive ever seen. Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I dont doubt any second that there are people wholl like this sense of  humor , but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers. Im working in a movie theater and in DVD Shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas At the movies it was a nice (but no big at all) success during the first two weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the movie dropped very fast. In DVD sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore. In the last ten years, the two worst movies Ive seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I cant decide which one was worse, but Im happy that there a so many good movies so I dont have to think too much on this question.#0
10962_3#This movie is terrible but it has some good effects.#0
3712_3#When I first heard about  Down To Earth,  I was pretty excited. Im a pretty big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rocks performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole. Rating 4/10#0
2625_8#Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disneys straight to video throw away sequels. Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2) I was glad that Disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation. The plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull. To break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences, which much like the jokes, range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part the MST3K-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really dont add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour-long flashback. The new characters are at least likable, and the old characters are out doing their thing so I cant fault them there. Overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King titles.#1
8074_4#Like a relative that gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has its heart in the right place but trips up with a bad execution. Stephen Carpenters writing/directing effort borrows freely from other, better films, such as Jacobs Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who havent seen either of these films, I wont give the premise away; suffice to say its not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior films. 4 out of 10#0
4273_1#There is nothing unique in either the TV Series nor the Movie. Which is a prequel to the TV Show, that isnt found everywhere else in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynches disgusting style of story telling, and after.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.#0
5937_9#After seeing the  Batman Dead End  short, I didnt know what to really expect from Worlds Finest. Of Course, Superman AND Batman. All my Worlds Finest comic books have them as the team-up. Overall, though, I would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work. There was a rumor about a Worlds Finest movie being made, and with the correct additions to the script, this could be it. Hope more like this are made.#1
2531_7#Really good horror flick featuring to of the greatest, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Rukh(Karloff)is on an expedition in Africa trying to find an ancient meteorite. After finding it, Rukh is poisoned by the its radiation. All he touches dies and the dark side of Rukh makes him become an egotistic murderer. His friend, Dr. Felix Benet(Lugosi)finds a limited remedy to the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of mankind by curing diseases. The two fiends will battle over the radiations possibilities. Pretty good special effects. Others in the cast Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.#1
758_9#I knew about this as a similar programme as Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it is the same, only more extreme. Basically three Welsh guys, and one mad British bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding, and a complete disregard/masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. They have had puking, eating pubes-covered pizza, jumping in stinging nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping/snoring, stunts in a work place, e.g. army, cowboys, and many more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe not just for themselves. Starring Matthew Pritchard who does pretty much anything, Lee Dainton also up for just about anything, Dan Joyce (the British one) who hardly does much physical stuff and has a OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot, but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was number something on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!#1
11596_3# The Dream Child  of 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated)  Nightmare  series, and at the latest from this point on, the series became total garbage. The only good films in the series were Wes Cravens 1984 original, and the third part,  The Dream Warriors  of 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for (admittedly great) visuals, and one creepy scene, a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came into existence. The rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester yelling stupid one-liners, and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses, who desperately try to avoid falling asleep, because good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, such as a super-dumb eerie childrens rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel In Short No originality, just a decline of the old formula, and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals, and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel,  Freddys Dead , which is awful beyond belief. In case youre not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast,  The Dream Child  should be avoided, and even if you are, this is more than likely to disappoint.#0
10811_1#This is one of the most god-awful movies ever. Shaq better just stick to basketball. This movie took away apart of my life I will never have back. I will make fun of this movie until I die, and then some. It is so horrible it is not even funny. MST3000 would have a blast with this one.#0
5153_4#Bad movie. It s too complicated for young children and too childish for grown-ups. I just saw it because I m a Robin Williams fan and I was very disappointed.(#0
7020_10# I mark where there are spoilers! Overall comments If you can take a serious movie, go see this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Dont leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! The movie fits together nicely in the second half. I will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens.  -Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he wont forgive himself for. Its still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt, or if he genuinely wanted to help people. I think its a little bit of bothI think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him because of what he is doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Nice job Will.#1
6073_1# MANY MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW  This movie was horrible. I am a huge baseball fan so I thought Id watch it, and I was very disappointed. It started out okay.. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son, I was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something. Anyways, at the beginning it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the protagonist. He was the only one that believed in Bobby, and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo, when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs Primo to death Not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song  I WANT TO      YOU   at random unfitting moments. This is NOT a sports movie. It is NOT about a fan. As far as I know, fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten, rob, and throw knives at their admirees. This is likely to be the sickest movie I will ever see in my life. The plot was shallow, the soundtrack sucked, the movie had no purpose whatsoever. I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film.#0
8076_7#Family is about two families who are after each others blood. There were a few loose points in the script; like; Amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot-free in the city. Kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague. How can the family of such a big don doesnt have any security cover?#1
5538_4#This is not really a zombie film, if were defining zombies as the dead walking around. Here the protagonist, Armand Louque (played by an unbelievably young Dean Jagger), gains control of a method to create zombies, though in fact, his method is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living peoples minds turning them into hypnotized slaves. This is an interesting concept for a movie, and was done much more effectively by Fritz Lang in his series of Dr. Mabuse films, including Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (1922) and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933). Here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fiancée, Claire Duvall (played by the Anne Heche look alike with a bad hairdo, Dorothy Stone) which is really the major theme. This one is not really a zombie film. Judging this movie on its own terms, its more of a semi-Gothic romance. As such it ranks a little below some of Universals bottom billed B horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s. So Ill give it a 5.#0
9520_10#This is a beautiful film. The true tale of bond between father and son. This is by far, Tom Hanks at his finest. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has the nice guy roles. Yet in this film,he comes off in this film as a bit gritty, but still emerges smelling like a rose, even until the very last scene, the assassination of his character. The cast of this movie was well put together. I also love the part when there is total silence when Tom Hanks character shoots and kills all of the men in Mr. Rooneys group. There is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene, just simply emotion. I love the look on John Rooney, Paul Newmans characters face when he realizes even before seeing him, that it is Tom Hankss character getting revenge, and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie I was blown away and knew I had to go out and get the video and I since have, adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies. Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this film has a special place in me.#1
500_2#The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a laughable title, its so utterly misleading. Its not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie. I cant recommend this to anyone.#0
11782_1#The danish movie  Slim Slam Slum  surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date. I didnt think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b-movies but this one deserves the gold. Its not funny. Its bad acting, Its bad filmed and the storyline is bad. The only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it. I truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie  Stjerner uden hjerner  as the badest danish film ever made! And thats truly something. Congratulations in advance #0
5700_8#Ive read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on DVD. To be honest I really dont know what the problem with it is. The soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70s B-side rock and obscure pop, spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala Boogie Nights.#1
2490_3#What a sad sight these TV stalwarts make, running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and shabby, and its not helped by a  big name  star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that hes given in a credible fashion. Maiden Voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored, and for being a fun game of  spot the Kiwi bit parters ; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break.#0
11589_3#Bottom-of-the-Freddy barrel. This is the worst film in the series, beating  Freddys Revenge  for that title. A cheap-looking (with mediocre special effects), incoherent mess, with Freddy turned into a punster. He has one or two cool lines, but that doesnt save this illogical and sloppy sequel.#0

11302_4#Cheap, mediocre sequel to the successful  The Mummys Hand  has presumably dead evil Professor Andoheb(George Zucco)preparing his predecessor Mehemet Bey(Turhan Bey)for the quest of revenge overseas to America using mummy Kharis(Lon Chaney, Jr who has no reason being in the disguise..any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims)in the goal of killing the surviving members of the Banning family whose patriarch Stephen(Dick Foran)and assistant Babe Hanson(Wallace Ford)retrieved the mummified corpse of Princess Ananka from her tomb in Egypt..Andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient Egyptian custom. Bey and the mummy Kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the High Priest of Karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise. Every Full Moon, Bey will feed Kharis a form of liquid derived of several Tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his masters wishes. Bey commands Kharis to kill Stephen and his sister Jane(Mary Gordon), while also biding time for Babe to return so that he will become victim  3. Dr. John Banning(John Hubbard)plans to wed Isobel(Elyse Knox), but doesnt know that Bey secretly covets his fiancé making plans to kidnap her with Kharis help. Johns life is in danger because of his father..hes also the last remaining member of the Banning line. If Bey has Isobel, theres no chance of any more Bannings being born. The police must find Kharis and the one responsible for his carnage..Bey. This film is a continuation from HAND set years later as members of that film, Foran, Ford & Zucco all appear in  aging  make-up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as Andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the Bannings. The cornball romance of John and Isobel seems merely in this plot so that Bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up. And, Bey merely sees her frolicking with John on the grass..the whole  love-at-first-sight  rubbish really didnt wash for me. Plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm..is any mummy really THAT powerful? This film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it. There really isnt that much story here and yes, typical of Universal monster pictures, even in America a mob of people will light..ho hum..torches going after Kharis. You know how itll end..John and the super-powerful Kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame.#0
1907_7#8 Simple Rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where Paul died which was the first episode I have ever watched of the show that comes on ABC. The Hennessy clan -- mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) -- look to one another for guidance and support after the death of Paul (John Ritter), the family patriarch. Cates parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend a hand. I am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put David Spade in this show since he was done with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all and all this show is pretty good. This show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80s and 90s that used to be on ABC.#1
9871_7#Return To the Lost World was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of The Lost World. Rating 3 stars out of 5.#1
5651_1#In my life I have seen many great and awful movies. I am not an expert in professional reviews, but I have definitely something to say about this one. Firstly, these actors are the worst I have seen Their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think that these actors were not interested in the quality.  Please, if my message reaches you - save your time and money.#0
3345_9#What I expected A rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team. Hey, I saw this with my wife -- not a baseball fan -- and she loved it as much as I did. Its neither a  Guy Flick  nor a  Chick Flick . Its a terrific make-you-laugh flick. Go see it #1
9918_10#I had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographers art by presenting the beauty in mans deconstructing the natural landscape. It certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations, setup shots, and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide. Put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show. Though never stated directly in any way, as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate, there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed. The progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in. What he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise. Unlike most films with environmental themes, this one ends with no call to arms. It argues basically whats the point, but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally.#1
6255_1#This is the only movie that my wife and I have ever walked out on. Totally sucked. We saw it in Omaha even. Not funny at all, looks like a 14 year old kid wrote the humor. I cant believe these real politicians were actually in the movie. awful.#0

8519_1#I went to see this film based on the review by Siskel and Ebert; not only did I get duped, but I took some friends along, and had to spend the rest of the day profusely apologizing for making them sit through this pointless crap. After this, I never went to see a movie based solely on Siskel & Eberts advice.#0
9979_7#To start off with, since this movie is a remake of a classic, the rating has to be lowered already. Since this version stars Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kowalski, it helps. There were some great shots of scenery in this film, and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. After much consideration, I gave this film a 7.#1
5214_7#Hong Kong directors crossing over to Hollywood to make movies is nothing new, with the temporary exodus of the likes of Tsui Hark, John Woo, Ringo Lam in the 90s. From their collective output, only a few movies (or may I say just one?) made an impact at the box office. The Andrew Lau and Alan Mak partnership has been a tour de force in recent HK cinematic history, especially with their now famous Infernal Affairs trilogy which was remade into Martin Scorseses The Departed, so its no surprise when Hollywood comes knocking on the door. But The Flock still makes decent entertainment, though X-philes out there would probably find it hard not to picture their favourite actors in the lead roles, given so much similarities in character. Gere and Danes do put forth some chemistry as the old fogey (heh) and his protégé, and while its not exactly great, Andrew Lau did manage to pull off something enjoyable.#1
5071_1#I cant even believe that this show lasted as long as it did. I guess its all part of the dumbing down of America. Personally, like David Spade said, I liked this show better when it went by its original title -  Seinfeld . What bothers me the most about this show, aside from the obvious, base sense of  humor , and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled. Truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like,  the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized , on the  Dick Van Dyke Show , or  the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory.  In other words, its an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers. That the writers and producers of  Friends  would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes, themselves, in such a fashion, before anyones even had a chance to even see it a second time, speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers, but, also, of the stultified minds of their viewers. You read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland, full of greeting card sentiment. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake Up. These people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors, but they somehow manage to live in $4000/mo. apartments? Get real. All I have to say to those amongst us that want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all of that. That New York doesnt exist for anyone making less than a serious six-figure income. But, good luck with all of that, anyway. Now, shut-up and pass the Soma.#0
9777_1#I was drawn to this movie, curious to see how they have adapted Hubert Shelbys brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, horrid situations, and social critique could not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong. I seriously can not recommend this movie, not even to a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. Its a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel, and shows very little creative input.#0
6809_7#This was a pretty good film. Im not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I didnt want to take a chance. Anyway, near the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a Scripture verse and then quotes another from memory. I cant remember the first passage he reads, but the second one is Genesis 96. He says its Genesis 912, but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment. Its too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the Bible today. Did anybody ever hear of John Jay, the first Supreme Court justice in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad weve lost that view in America.#1
11778_10#This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. It brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the authors subsequent opus,  Collapse . Diamond himself comes off as personable and caring, not just a disinterested or disengaged academic. This series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to  publish or perish,  as the saying goes about academe, but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects,  Why you white people got so much cargo, and we have so little?  Because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, Diamond looked for an answer that didnt insult that intelligence or that community. I like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as  South Parks   Blame Canada   Blame wheat!  #1
4386_9#This is one powerful film. The first time I saw it, the Scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience. I gave up on it but then acquired the DVD, used the English subtitles when I needed them, and really got into this movie, discovering just how good it is. It is excellent. Few actors come across as despicable as Roth. Man, you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant, irritating puss. (He is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone elses here). Neeson is a mans man and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong in here as the female lead. The movie draws you in and gets you totally involved, so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this.#1
4435_1#Gods, I havent watched a movie this awful in a long while. Maybe not since The New Guy or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, it is that astoundingly awful. Mira Sorvinos blank and wooden acting surely mustve been inspired by Freddie. The movie staging was awkward (like a play, rather, and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her seducing other characters and they falling for it. And what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn the dvd player off, it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film.#0
741_7#I was just a bit young for this one, but I had to see it. Theres some excellent music, which many folks have mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by  Angel , a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit. Wearing their trademark white outfits, they grind through  20th Century Foxes , and apparently all try to cram into the cameras field of vision. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria remains the bands highlight, and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut, ever! Cherie Currie (ex-Runaways singer) begins a brief, but notable, acting career here, and is quite memorable alongside Jodie Foster, and the rest. (Her topless 3-D scenes in  Parasite , and her UFO sighting, in  Wavelength  kept us all watching her for a time).  Its not a masterpiece, but it preserves a chunk of its period, for all to gaze upon, and wonder.#1
9187_1#I have watched some pretty poor films in the past, but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie. Had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it, because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it. Comic book guy would be right if he said  Worst movie ever  #0
1509_10#The British horror film was in terminal decline by the start of the Seventies, but out of the blackness came three films that were among the best our island produced. The Wickerman, Blood on Satans Claw and The House That Dripped Blood made the future seem rosy, even though a lot of people knew by this point there wasnt going to be one. THTDB has the sort of cast that could easily form a wishlist, if it hadnt actually been assembled, in the bleak hinterland of 2008 you may well find yourself expecting to wake up. Waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is, naturally, my favourite, Cushings life and art are interlinked so firmly that you cant tell where performance ends and pain begins. One can only guess how this role affected such a gentle, sensitive man. Death and the maiden. RIP Peter.#1
11550_7#If you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film, you will be left with a fantastic comedy. As it is, I still found it to be a pretty good movie, which is no small feat considering the coma I was put in by the opening scenes. To put it mildly, this film has a dreary beginning that wasnt even remotely funny, or even upbeat. Once things get sillier, however, you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if youre a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see their earlier work.#1
3116_10#The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesnt like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting. The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. All in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.#1
11028_8#To be honest, I didnt like that much this movie when I saw it for the first time. But I guess the trouble is that I havent seen it in a theater. Big Mistake ! Because the 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and 2 is the cinematography. Try to see this movie on the largest TV possible and a great sound system. The music is good and puts the movie to a higher level (and a commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. Its definitely one of Renny Harlins best movie. THis guy knows about action. Die Hard 2, The long kiss good bye, etc. And its particularly good in this movie. The special effect are great and spectacular. Stallone really needed that movie get back with success. Still good to see him !#1
1213_10#This movie does contradict the first one as far as the origins of the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins goes. I wont deny that. However, if you look at  Part II  as a separate film, then its a very good movie. I remember watching this in the early 80s (and fitting into its targeted demographic audience then), and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie (not that I didnt enjoy that one too, its just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it). Sure its darker than the first one too, but perhaps maybe thats why its so good. And its dark in deeper kind of subtle way too (that kids may not fully understand, but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off, and adults watching will surely get quicker as I have now watching this film again now in my mid-twenties) where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit/demon in exchange for something else. Get the picture? But simply watching that as a child, sure as I said it may have been a little scary, but nothing traumatizing. In fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game I could play when I was that age. I cant tell you the number of times I used to pretend Dark Heart wanted to imprison me, have me help him capture the Care Bears, tried to make me turn over to his dark side, and other things like that etc. So this movie was also good for my imagination. And its also got great emotional depth to it too. I used to watch it at least once a week.  What good is love and caring if it cant save her?  #1
12325_3#I remember that show. I still remember that kick ass fun song  Americas Funniest People.  Frankly it shouldve been titled Americans lame or unfunny or downright disgusting People. Dave couldnt save this show and neither could Bob Saget or the replacement hosts for AFV that came later. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes Dave could make some good voice overs that were better than Bobs. But this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted. Also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the Olson Twins. Plus AFV was in its prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner. Did I mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame? But still the theme song rocks #0
3339_4#Barry, a medical transcriptionist has his mind corroding from his job coupled with memories of an abusive upbringing at the hands of his stepfather, Barry (the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). He spirals into madness and eventually a serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of a bald mute guy) battle for control of his soul. This film is undone by some bad acting and unintentional humorous scenes. Not to say its horrible or anything, just that you cal tell that its only as known as it is on account of Bruce Campbells rabid fan base (of which I am one) who will likely see anything hes in or involved with in some way. 2 Easter Eggs highlight the eyes for a laughing outtake (left eye) and one minute of nothing but an actual Easter egg (right eye)#0
3061_1#This film is awful. Give me the dentist anytime! Can you believe that one of the main TV stations here in Arabia had this as their Christmas film! I can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with Dudley Moore rather than this. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting, better plot, more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid. Dont even watch it if youre drunk!#0
871_9#Sur mes lèvres or READ MY LIPS is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of outsiders, people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to fit in. Director Jacques Audiard with and co-writer Tonino Benacquista have created a tense, tight, completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights. Devos and Cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong. Once again Alexandre Desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the Hitchcockian sense of suspense. Director Audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story he shows us the difference between hearing the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments. This is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the French film noir genre. Recommended. Grady Harp#1
1356_4#I firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a  spoof . Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally introduced the film at the screening I saw in Chicago. He had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy.  What is it?  is Crispin Glovers attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by Herzog, Lynch etc. In other words just watch the trailer, be entertained, and leave it at that. There are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases, but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment.#0
11392_1#For years I remember reading about this show  Trouble With Tracy  in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am! I lived about a two-hour drive north of Toronto and we couldnt get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we cant have. Talented Canadian Actor Steve Weston died a few years afterward, but many would argue he effectively  died  the first time he appeared on this show. When I saw it for the first time that cold Saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed, part of me died, too.#0
12447_8#Theres a great deal of material from the Modesty Blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie. Unfortunately, several attempts have been made and theyve fallen short of the great potential in the character. So, no, this isnt the Modesty you know from the comic strip (currently reprinted in nice editions from Titan Books). This is Modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip, and from what you can piece together from her back-story, its accurate. The movie does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important to Blaises adventures throughout most of the published stories. What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself. She never loses her composure, and you never doubt that shes in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns. Most of the movie takes place within a casino, which undoubtedly saved money on the production. It doesnt matter. The film does not come across as cheap. Instead, it gives a fairly comprehensive (and believable) back-story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead. Should Miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now, theyve laid out the characters background nicely and wont have to spend much time on her  origin.  I realize the words  Direct-to-Video  dont inspire confidence, but this film is well worth a look.#1
3495_7#This film captures the true struggle with identity that is ongoing in our teenage years. It is really moving and it feels strangely like a documentary-not contrived but very real. It is very interesting and unsettling#1
2392_8#I have a 19-month old and got really tired of watching Care Bears all the time. Rooney is a great dancer, who cares if he is gay. This guy must have been a cheerleader or something. Bus driver Bob cannot dance, take lessons from Rooney#1
4398_9#When I heard this film was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. This Taiwanese director burst into fame with  The Wedding Banquet  and  Eat Drink Man Woman  a few years ago and then moved on to  Sense and Sensibility  and  The Ice Storm . Now, he turns his attention to another American icon -- the Civil War. #1
2284_10#This is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. I am very impressed at the film, not just for the plot and superb acting, but that such a unique movie was made. Most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking Brit or a mighty battle, but not this. This isnt about this kind of war, its about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. Going back to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi haters, providing for interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. Nolte more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what its asking.#1
976_3#I am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original -- have not seen, and doubt I will. It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (Jimmy Fallon). Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. Hes supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot. Not Fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells Fallon that its over, too much has happened, and shes moving on. And rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago. But of course the plot mechanics wont allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. Its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.#0
6024_10#I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a major disappointment. Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey 60s. Its politics too upfront and ridiculous. And lets face it, I was still under a love-spell known as BLOWUP  and I still havent completely shaken it. Now the  love  is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and, oh well . . . Good Luck to me! Peace.#1
4848_4#I love a good war film and I fall into the  been there, done that  category. So I would like to think my review is an accurate one (IMHO). Having just watched this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. There is no way I can recommend this film to you. Not recommendedit will just bore you.#0
9832_10#Wow this was a great Italian  ZOMBIE  movie by two great directors Luci Fulci ( ZOMBIE ) and Bruno Mattie ( HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD ) Lucio started this movie and was ill so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out so if you have seen  HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD  directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw  ZOMBIE  directed by Lucio Fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great  ZOMBIE  make-up witch equals great looking  ZOMBIES  has a funny  ZOMBIE  flying head!And  ZOMBIE  birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a  ZOMBIE  (That Only Happed To Two People) but they are mainly just the great toxic  ZOMBIES  like in Bruno Matties  HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD .So if you like Italian  ZOMBIE  movies or just  ZOMBIE  movies in general than check this one out its a great Italian  ZOMBIE  movie #1
11839_9#This movie was highly entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well. The score is also uplifting and dramatic. I dont understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7. Definately a keeper in my household.#1
10847_10#Im 60 years old, a guitarist, (lead/rhythm), and over the last forty years, Ive been in four bands, its all there, the fights, the foul-ups, the rotten food, the worse accommodation, always travelling, little or no money, and every one was drunk or high. But, the clubs, the fans, and the music, made it all worth it! Just like Strange Fruit! Im too damn old for it now, and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking, but for the length of that video, it all came back, and it was all there! The birds, the brawls, and the booze! And I was young again! Its just like Billy Connollys voice over, God likes that 70s stuff! Rock On Forever!#1
12194_3#The film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are, and who the characters are. And that is the moment i started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand, i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything. I actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept. I also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be. I understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot, but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes.#0
4360_1#First of all let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie. The best review for this kind of Cinema can be just the silence. Movie addressed to housewives and to grandmothers. This movie tries to look  genuine  and the characters should be supposed  real people . An Italian could never think that the characters might be  real  they are just  low-profile  stereotypes. It gives a very misguised vision of what life is in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (plot? which plot?) and the humour does not make laugh anyone older than 12.#0
2808_3#A cast of 1980s TV movie and TV series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley,Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others)in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models. Of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications. Over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest. This is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name of Skinamax. I really cant see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there. (I also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking, to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up)#0
9233_4#I always found Betsy Drake rather creepy, and this movie reinforces that. As another review said, this is a stalker movie that isnt very funny. I watched it because it has CG in it, but he hardly gets any screen time. Its no  North by Northwest #0
2354_1#I do not even want to call this thing a film - it is a movie that should not have won any awards. The acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios. This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of  trying  throughout the movie.  I feel ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-enjoyable parts of this rubbish were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Other than that, do not even waste your time with this film.#0

2208_7#College girl Joanne Murray takes on the unenviable job of readying the student housing building to become apartments,which includes selling the unneeded furniture This takes place during a break,so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly-empty premises on campus. Dorm that Dripped Blood  is a low-budget slasher flick that is quite entertaining.The acting is pretty bad,the plot is predictable,but the gore effects are quite good.The film was made by UCLA film students Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow for next to nothing.Soon a dreamy ambiance kicks in,very similar to the enveloping forests of Jeff Leibermans fantastic  Just Before Dawn .7 out of 10.Its great to see Daphne Zuniga of  The Initiation  fame run over few times by a car.#1
6350_2#Ive seen my share of Woody Allens movies, and while theyre not always great, you can usually be sure youre going to be entertained. Probably the last really good ones were Bullets Over Broadway (94) and Mighty Aphrodite (95) - since then the ones Ive seen have been patchy but watchable. And so when I was invited to see the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, which I wasnt even aware had been released yet, I went along happily. I hadnt really heard much about it so I hoped I would be pleasantly surprised. To be fair to the actors, the script they are working with is lacking if not non-existent. Definitely a long way from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.#0
10405_8#This film, was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that, unlike some other films I liked in that period The Thief of Bagdad has held on to its quality while I grew up. This is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children, it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well. The only drawback there is, is that one can not see past the bad effects (compared to the effects nowadays) like one could when one was a child. I remembered nothing of those effects, of course it had been about ten years since Id seen this film, when I was about eleven years old. Who then watches effects? One only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides. In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. Coming to think of it I feel like the Indiana Jones films are quite a like this film. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern, it succeeds in not being dusty and old. All of that is mainly due to the great story, the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors. In that department Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. Great film and although an oldie, definitely a goldie. I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD someday. 8 out of 10#1
6912_10#Superb comic farce from Paul Mazursky, Richard Dreyfuss, plays Jack Noah a fairly successful actor- who is On location shooting a film in a fictitious Latin American banana republic Parador,Ruled by the Fascist, Alfonse Sims who unfortunately has succumbed of a heart attack after indulging in too many local cocktails! Raul Julia plays the oily chief of police who forces the reluctant Noah To impersonate the Just deceased dictator who Noah bears a remarkable resemblance, Sonia Braga plays the dictators glamorously lusty mistress, who gives Noah a few lessons in how to act like a dictator, Jonathan Winters literally rounds off the cast as a CIA man In Parador posing as a hammock salesman. Can Noah win over the people of Parador? and hold off the rebels? And give the performance of a lifetime without losing his in the process? Sammy Davis Jnr,has a cameo as himself who amusingly croons the national anthem of Parador as well as Begin the Beguine, Frog Number one(Fernando Rey pops up as a kindly servant, Charo is also on hand as A busty maid, The score by Maurice Jarre,is excellent.#1
3950_7#Finally got to see this classic TV movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old VHS, it is a classic piece of horror. Its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS  the TV horror movie. Recommended for all fans of the 70s TV movie much like trilogy of terror. Those interested should get the book on the subject by David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70s. Email me for a chance to see it..its fabulous to see it again. It does have it problems like many TV movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects dept and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today.#1
1503_9#(SPOILERS included) This film surely is the best Amicus production Ive seen so far (even though I still have quite a few to check out). The House that Dripped Blood is a horror-omnibusan anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious, hellish house in the British countryside. A common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate talesPeter Duffels film wisely doesnt pay too much attention to that. It simply handles about a Scotland Yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that, he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before. All four stories in this film are of high quality-level and together, they make a perfect wholesome. High expectations are allowed for this film, since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch! Yes, the same Bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone `Psycho Were also marking Peter Duffels solid and very professional debut as a director.  No doubt about itThe House that Dripped Blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans. I truly believe that, with a bit of mood-settling preparations, this could actually be one of the few movies thatll terrify you and leave a big impression. Intelligent and compelling horror like it should be! Highly recommended. One extra little remark, though this film may notrepeat MAY NOT under any circumstances be confused with `The Dorm that Dripped Blood. This latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80s slasher that has got nothing in common with this film, except for the title it stole.#1
882_4#There is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.#0
7982_10#I am amazed that movies like this can still be made. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen. Never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on. You must see this movie.#1
8206_10#Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th movie of the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older but hes still got it, Harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (where the memorable  Make My Day  catchphrase comes from!) But the city he took a vacation was worse, a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after The Enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwoods sunglasses were Gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator. Worth a watch if you like Clint Eastwood, the Dirty Harry films or like action crime thrillers.#1
3792_8#I saw this film earlier today, and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters. It didnt feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know. All in all, a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films.#1
12159_7#- After their sons are sentenced to life in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin receiving threatening phone calls because someone fells their sons got off easy. The pair decides to move to California to escape the publicity of the trial and to start a new life. They start a dance school that is soon very successful. One of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. In the meantime, Helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with an evangelist on the radio. Its only a mater of time before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder. - I just love these former-female-stars-in-the-twilight-of-their-career horror movies. Whats the Matter with Helen? is as fun as any.#1
7822_8#Its sad to view this film now that we know how the ANC got shafted by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing much. Woods achieved little. Yes, outright apartheid was abolished, but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites, leaving the ANC government more or less impotent. As Naomi Klein writes in The Shock Doctrine, in the talks between the black and white leaderships  the deKlerk government had a twofold strategy. First drawing on the ascendant Washington Consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy, it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making --- such as trade policy and the central bank --- as  technical  or  adminsitrative . Then it used a wide range of new policy tools --- international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs --- to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts, economists and officials from the IMF, the World Bank, the GATT and the National Party --- anyone except the liberation fighters from the ANC.  The statistical results are horrifying, with not much change accomplished, and AIDS flourishing. Viewing Cry Freedom in this light is deeply ironic --- actually tragic. The ANC has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem.#1
776_7#I think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second, as someone else wrote in a comment, the implications of this kind of relationships (incest and lesbianism) in the romanian society. a total of 7/10. mostly for the story#1
10724_2#this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad hence, can i advice anyone to watch it? well, i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition (i still cant believe it won)..and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q&a section..but that was also anything but interesting.. whats it about? well the first half (the worth watching one) presents three characters a hooker, a musician and some kind of official..the first two lie about their professions..but the third is the actual liar.. the second half (do something else..dont ruin a good evening) includes some old breasts and heavy drinking.. but maybe you will see it completely differentthe tiff jury did (were they drinking vodka ?)#0
12295_3#This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures. Sure, the effects are laughable, the story confused, but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun. I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in, it added to what little suspense was mustered. Give it a 3.#0
11155_10#Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York thinking hell make a living by being a stud. He gets there and finds out quickly that it isnt going to be easy--he goes through one degrading experience after another. At the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled, sleazy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they make it? A great film---but very dark. Im giving it a 10. DONT see it on commercial TV--its cut to ribbons and incomprehensible.#1
5037_10#This could be the most underrated movie of its genre. I dont remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didnt do so well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie. I rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list. This is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. The tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) get killed and religious experiences are questioned. It has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I own the DVD and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers.#1
10227_1#This is a well-worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangmans noose, then sets about  taming  his reluctant bride. It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time. We never find out, for example, why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband. Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a  real man  in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own. This only made sense in fifties Hollywood. Total waste of time. Even the scenerys kinda dull. Give this one a big miss.#0
4447_2#Yes there are worse movies out there. Most of them made for fun, on a shoe string budget, or as a t.v. movie of the week, but even if this was the movie of the week it would rate no more than two stars. It is a poor movie about a serious subject featuring an abused woman who flees the king of the slime people in to the protective arms of the king of the wussy people. ( If this is an attempt to show that she doesnt need a man to protect her than wuss man is superfluouse to the film and ought not to be in it at all). It has no suspense, no character development, and an heroine that could be outsmarted by a rotton onion. ( I think she flushes her wedding ring on a boat with a self contained tank rather than just dropping it overboard in the ocean (where her body should be anyway) and after the husband finds her, demonstrating that she is a moron, she still makes childish assumptions that lead to almost getting her killed.) I am always amazed when I see the sort of generally high rating a movie like this gets and it makes me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who would be challenged by his work. After I get done laughting at humanity I weep.#0
11949_3#This dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused badly here. I might have chuckled once or twice during this film, but in general, its a boring movie, with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure. The premise, although routine, still wasnt bad, but once the plot was set, the film went nowhere. Dont waste your time with this misfire.#0
879_8#After erasing my thoughts nearly twenty-seven times, there is a feeling that I can now conquer this review for the complex French drama,  Read My Lips . Having written over five hundred reviews, I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director Jacques Audiards subtle, yet inspirational love story. Thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film, and while the  loves  overpowered, it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind.  Read My Lips  is a drama. To be more precise, is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work. Here is where this review begins to crumble, it is all of these items  but it is moremuch, much more. As a viewer, you are pulled in instantly by Emmanuelle Devos portrayal of this fragile woman named Carla, whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty. Audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid, causing an immediate unrest, not only from the characters within the film, but to those watching. Without sound, the world is left open to any possibility, and that is frightening. Grade      out of      #1
831_2#Live! Yes, but not kicking.  Spoiler  This is an appallingly bad piece of film, together with a ridiculous ending. So she gets shot in the end, is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? Dont take my word for it, but I would say this leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead, youll get more quality.#0
5901_7#Its a rehash of many recent films only this one has fewer stars, lesser complications and a more fuzzy feel to it. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friends wedding where their own marriage (unbeknowst to them) begins its process of being arranged. Within no time the two strangers are married and sent of to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar to theirs. As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and/or mended and love blossoms. C+#1
391_4#For the first couple of seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show. The combination between reality TV and a 16 week job-interview was innovative, and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too  out there . R.I.P The Apprentice. Please NBC, for Gods sake, get the show off the air as soon as possible. Its just too embarrassing to watch. The Apprentice was once a great TV-show, but now its just a big fat joke.#0
4359_10#One woman, by herself in a house for 45-minutes of screen time, doesnt sound like a formula to hold you on the edge-of-your-seat but FUTURE SHOCK is truly as thrilling as they come! Writer / star Vivian Schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress, and enlarges them to terrifying proportions, so dont watch this film alone!#1
5239_3#I watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that I read about it here by others. #0
5205_7#A bunch of American students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of Ireland in order to study ancient religious practices. Despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of straying off the beaten path (by the local creepy Irish guy, natch), they do just that, and wind up with their insides on the outside courtesy of a family of inbred cannibals (the descendants of the infamous Sawney Bean clan, who according to the films silly plot, upped sticks from Scotland and settled on the Emerald Isle). NB. A very troubled production and studio meddling resulted in Christian Viel eventually abandoning the project. Re-shoots were done and the gore was heavily trimmed for a US release. The good news is that although the film doesnt flow as well as it might have, and is cursed with a terrible ending, the UK DVD (the version I watched) seems to have been left relatively intact as far as the splatter is concerned (only 13s were cut from the film in total).#1
4628_2#Misty Ayers had a smoking body, and thats all this movie was about. Pure exploitation flick. I started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music. And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Case in point casually walking into a room and saying  Hello  was scored with chase music from a roman epic. Id like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this movie that womens low-rise panties existed in 1954. Im talking Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is Misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing (except for bra and panties, sadly). Also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a  Look out! Godzirra!  effect.#0
6073_9#My college professor says that Othello may be Shakespeares finest drama. I dont know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the film. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. SUrprisingly, he didnt direct it but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare just as well as British actors can do. not that there was a British vs. American issue about it. In fact, if we all work together then Shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with the issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. Its quite a great scene at the end of the film but I wont reveal the ending. ITs just worth watching. I think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit Shakespeare.#1
5849_8#Damn straight..this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine cartoons today. I cant wait to track down some of the DVDs to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. Ive already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one)and I laughed my head off when he said to me one day  Dad..you sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid   How cool is that. Cheers#1
6496_1#This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I am the type of person who starts a movie and doesnt turn it off until the end, but I was forcing myself not to turn it off.  I also agree that Anthony Hopkins needs to stick to acting. By the time the movie was over I didnt even get the plot. I was both confused and annoyed.#0
6766_8#Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Premingers Where the Sidewalks Ends, from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel Night Cry by Frank Rosenberg Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism#1
2858_10#Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series). The cast had chemistry, and they seemed to genuinely like each other. That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have. It also made many of their best stories into great western drama. Overall, the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left, it slowly declined. Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too. By 1970, the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical, and it had lost a lot of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show, and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the 465 episodes that were produced, at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama! That is a pretty good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows.#1
3628_1#An art house mavens dream. Overrated, overpraised, overdone; a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve Best Picture of 1951 on its own merits, it was dwarfed by the competition from the start. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; you name it, if it came out in 51, its better than this arthouse crapola. The closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few actors in their time were less capable (at acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My 12 Worst of 51 (I saw 201 movies), and among the 5 worst Best Picture Oscar winners.#0
1658_1#This is possibly the most boring movie in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor/director Roman Polanski. I think I would rather see the Three Amigos than ever watch this movie again. It promptly went from the DVD player straight into the garbage. My apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked New Coke as well. I am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie, it is slow, dull and has no real plot. You wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started. I understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around. Thank god disco and Threes Company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the Bay City Rollers. Oh well just my thoughts.#0
8443_4#Anna lives with her family in a new housing estate just outside the city. She has been with her husband Sebastiaan for years and they dont talk so much anymore. While on a working visit abroad, a female colleague commits suicide. Anna is deeply impressed by her death, even though she hardly knew her. Nobody seems to know why she took her own life. For the first time Anna realizes that one can be an unknown among your most dearest. Anna doesnt mention the incident back home and starts observing her husband and child. Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly starts looking at her own life. And she wonders how she got so drifted apart from the people closest to her. (This is my translation of the DVD cover text synopsis. I hope you find it useful, as this movie doesnt have an IMDb Plot Summary yet at this date.)#0
9391_8#Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hoppers creepy, violent character and JT Walshs sneakiness. There are only 4 real characters of note here, with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first twist hits early on, and from there its a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 pts.#1
7743_8#I went to see it 2 times this movie, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, and he was telling me it was so great, that I was expecting very much about the movie, to mutch, I couldnt enjoy it because I was not watching it in nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After The second time I felt so in the mood to have a party. I LOVED the music its just great. #1
7079_1#No reason to bother renting this flick. From the opening credits on, I knew I was in trouble. Boring sex scenes, bad plot, and cameos by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette arent enough to save this film.#0
11110_9#I cant add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here - great acting, balanced writing, multi-faceted characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, great commentary on millennial American life. The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tonys mother issues are especially fresh and humorous. Several other characters add a lot of depth - Heshs interesting history as an outsider muscling in, Ralphies total irredeemable viciousness, Chris dual desires in life, and so on. Not everything is perfect however. A lot of characters have only appeared once, when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee the dancer, Meadows friend Ally, Uncle Juniors ladyfriend (supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1).#1
6015_7#In the early 1970s, many of us who had embraced hippy/acid/alternative culture wholeheartedly, had realised that mainstream society was not going to change in the way we thought it would. For me this film defined the tension of  now what?  that many of the people I knew felt at that time. Do we head for the commune and create our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and push for change? From the futile gestures to police, the radical rhetoric, the music of Pink Floyd, to the love-making and the explosive images in the desert - so much is in there. It captures well a significant moment in time.#1
6338_9#I really liked this movie I saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details. I think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it. I specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was, the villain in this movie was not the actual Grinch but the Major, much different than the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike.#1
5564_2#Probably the worst Dolph film ever. Theres nothing youd want or expect here. Dont waste your time. Dolph plays a miserable cop with no interests in life. His brother gets killed and Dolph tries to figure things out. The character is just plain stupid and stumbles around aimlessly. Pointless.#0
5690_7#Just watched this movie on DVD and thought the acting was very good, but the over all story left a lot to be desired. This movie has the same texture and look of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle; on the underbelly of society, in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use, crime, violence, sex, and a total lack of self-respect for anyone or anything, including themselves. Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role of  burnt-out  former porn star John Holmes. The supporting cast is just as good. However, this is a bleak, dark, disturbing, and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well. Unless you have an interest in these murders or were a  fan  of John Holmes, this really isnt a film to see. If you want to see a docu-drama on murder, Truman Capotes 1960s In Cold Blood starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.#1
6286_3#This film is pure, distilled, unadulterated boredom. I knew nothing of it before I entered the dark room, took my seat. I was seduced by the  mysterious and suspenseful  blurb on the poster I suppose. Also, Lena Headey is nice and unconventionally sexy, and Richard Jenkins is always a reliable guy to have around, so the cast seemed reasonable. It may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on. I shouldve gone to see Valkyrie for the second time instead. There are some nice moods and touches throughout, and I dare say director Sean Ellis could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if he was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time.#0
12478_9#What a lovely heart warming television movie. The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very distressed ..only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness.Which all viewers hope will materialise. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the little girls mum ,as she was as the nanny in  Jack and Sarah ,worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and happy; year tear jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as, always a delightful grandmother in this tender and magnificently acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is charming and a most convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story which makes it so touching. Mermaid  is a tribute to the milk of human kindness which is clearly illustrated and clearly is still all around us in this difficult world we live in.  Mermaid  gives us all hope ,by realising that there a lot of lovely people in the world with lots of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.#1
11891_1#Its the worst movie Ive ever seen. The action is so unclear, work of cameras is so poor, actors are so affected  and this lamentable 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - dont watch it unless you like such a low class torture.#0
9657_10#Presque Rien (Come Undone) is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director Sébastien Lifshitz (with the collaboration of writer Stéphane Bouquet - the team that gave us the later Wild Side). As we come to understand Lifshitzs manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable. By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now, time passed, time reflective, time imagined, time alone - Lifshitz makes his tales more personal, involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters responses. It takes a bit of work to key into his method, but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film. After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful. Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion, conflicts with passions powers found in love, and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful. The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative. Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making. In French with English subtitles. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp#1
431_4#Admittedly, I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. He was a fine actor until Scent of a Woman, where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably. I hoped this film, of which Id heard almost nothing growing up, would be a nice little gem. An overlooked, ahead-of-its-time, intelligent and engaging city-political thriller. Its not. Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and were left with several  confession  monologues, that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the  real world  of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal. I dont think were left with that in City Hall, and while its a very full film, I dont find it altogether rich.#0
8782_4#John Rivers life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car. During the days she has been missing, he confronts a man thats been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other-side through E.V.P - Electronic Voice Phenomenon. Naturally he doesnt believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about E.V.P. Soon enough John is hooked onto it, but something supernatural doesnt like him interfering with the dead, as now other then contacting his wife, the white noise is foretelling events before they happen. I wouldnt care to see it again and I wouldnt recommend to anyone, unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of Hollywood produced horror/thrillers. Its just a damn shame that this over-produced flick couldnt put it together successfully, as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand. I didnt hate it, but what a disappointment.#0
2410_1#Hood of the Living Dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored (lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing). I find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home video footage is better than this film (although the similarities between them warrant the comparison).  Hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies! . Hopefully nobody ELSE wasnt. My apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie.#0
6601_4#I can see why Laurel and Hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle re-enactment, but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and theres a reasonably good supporting cast. I enjoyed it.#0
11651_10#WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS, in my opinion, is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Anytime Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw up, I wanted to vomit myself. Its kind of hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. However, I did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents. Before I wrap this up, Id like to say,  If you ask me, WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a persons body.   Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone who hasnt seen it. Youre in for some tears and a good time, so the next time its on TV, kick back with a friend and watch it.#1
7169_8#Typically,  kids  films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13. But then again, thats before Holes hit the scene. Sure, it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray. What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didnt try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine, kind of like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar, redemptive ending to it). The only down side? The hokey looking lizards. Overall, however, an 8/10.#1
6053_1#absolutely trash. i liked Halloween and from then on johnnys been in a downward spiral. this is about the pits. we get it john. pro-lifers are scary! you dont have to make a shitty film that bores the hell out of me to tell me. The pacing is way off here. It feels like john didnt have much to work with here. to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk. There are countless times where the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb. i love the long cut. too bad carpenter doesnt know how to employ it. he needs to bunk up with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please John, stop making a fool of yourself and boring me to death!#0
6820_7#The movie was much better than the other reviewer stated. Its a nice family movie. It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girls family in many ways. She is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run. It reminds me of a Hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6-12 years (maybe a bit older) and its pretty much PG or G rated. Im an adult who can appreciate a nice  family  movie - I guess the other reviewer isnt.#1
6972_3#When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug chasing a few nurses) And the name  Blue Monkey , I knew I wasnt in for any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese-ball flick, who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles. The FX are pretty corny, there isnt too much of a plot, and Im still not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey. But come on people, what did you expect?? Its not really as bad as it seems. If you enjoy the old 50s style black and white bug attack movies, this one is basically an updated version, without the updates special FX#0
10948_1#What were they thinking at  Cannes ? One of the most irritating, films of all time. Every detail of this film, no matter how meaningless was shown. If I had to watch her put on those boots one more time I think I would have shouted. If the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life Rosetta had, then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running. But no, we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over. The whole thing was filled with un-likeable and unsympathetic characters. They deserved the misery that was Rosetta. And to think I passed up  Tumbleweeds  to see this over-hyped film of boredom. It was like watching grass grow, only that is more exciting.#0
7332_7#I had watched snippets from this as a kid but, while I purchased Blue Undergrounds set immediately due to its being a Limited Edition, only now did I fit it in my viewing schedule - and thats mainly because Bakshis American POP (1981) just turned up on late-night Italian TV (see my review of that film below)!  Vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! It goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live-action performances (in a studio) of segments from the script - which would then be traced, blended in with the backgrounds and filmed. Still, having watched several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation (on the Disney Tins and the Looney Tunes sets, for instance), its doesnt make for a very compelling piece#1
7590_3#Gorgeous bodies, gorgeous colors and camera work, pretentious dialog, banal plot. The name of the prima donna, Camilla, and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently, are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from Dumas novel La Dame aux Camelias, the movie Camille starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least Verdis opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not-too-virtuous young ladies, social outcasts for one reason or another, loved, split up, reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene One forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera, but why waste Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful rendition of LA in the 30s, a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman, and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isnt even any beautiful singing?#0
12425_7#Like I said its a hidden surprise. It well written well acted and well cast. I liked everything in this movie. Look its Hollywood all right but the brighter side. Angelina Jolie is great in this and Im totally watching every movie with her in that I can get my hands on. Well worth a look.#1
1803_10#My dog recently passed away, and this was a movie I loved as a kid, so I had to see it to try to cheer up. The great part about this movie that focuses on a persons ability to learn right from wrong over time, and a childs ability to cope with the natural occurrence of death of their pet, is that it never shows anyone dying! The watch symbolizes his life, and the watch is shown being submerged and stopped. All the deaths were suggestive, even for the villain. I didnt cry during this movie until now, and I have gotten so much more out of it, that I had to write it down and share it with you.#1
6242_1#Lets be honest shall we? Al Gore no more TRULY cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus. Its a hook! Make no mistake, Al Gore is a POLITICIAN! Three years ago he was busted/ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving NOT a hybrid, a Yugo, or even a GM Metro but a LINCOLN (go google it if you like)! Or how about the fact that Mr. Gore & his Hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of  An Inconvenient Truth.  So much for conservation huh, Al? Anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at  An Inconvenient Truth  & discover the main fundamental flaw. While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed  global Warming  there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it. For example I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot & they can point out an automobile which is not running right. BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? Generally not! A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasnt even invented yet)? What did they have, a June bug in a match box? Hell, even 50-60 years ago? Therefore, how do we know with ANY degree of certainty that the planet is  getting warmer  when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? Or that man is THE sole cause of it? The answer is we dont & Science is NEVER a consensus. Thirty years ago, Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a  New Ice Age . The truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Erruptions, Solar Activity & El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed  Global Warming.  Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al & implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we cant even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism? Answer Its wishful thinking, Mr. Gore & you being a former VP of the USA know it! If the folks who produced  An Inconvenient Truth  were really honest, they would have titled their film  Al Gore Wants Attention.  But what Id really like is for someone to ask the former VP this; why were two of the planets biggest polluters (AKA China & India) EXEMPT from abiding by the Kyoto Accords? Anyway, I hear the producers of A.I.T are working on their next film entitled  Gnomes, Fairies & Elves Our Endangered Friends.  #0
942_2#Saw this late one night on cable. At the time I didnt know that the girl billed as  Shannon Wilsey  was actually porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often, thank God) that I actually sat through this brain-rotting drivel. I like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy--more than the next guy, actually--but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid. The truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the directors, writers and special effects peoples virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movies only saving grace. Savannah, before she turned into the plasticized Barbie Doll she became as a porn queen, is really interesting to watch--shes drop-dead gorgeous, bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times, glances off-camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time, which is more than can be said for the audience. For even though Savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked, it still cant hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, badly made and annoying movie. If you know someone who has it on video, or if it comes on cable some night, check it out, but dont waste your money on a rental.#0
6838_4#Plot Synopsis Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is murdered along with his wife by his associates. His twin sons, Chad & Alex, are split apart. 25 years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, & Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, join forces to avenge their parents murder & rightfully claim the tunnel. This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich have worked together, having previously done  Lionheart . This is also the first of three films to feature Van Damme playing dual roles ( Maximum Risk  &  Replicant  are the others). The plot is a very simplistic take on the revenge story, the films sole redeeming feature being Van Dammes performance as two very different people  the prissy rich kid & the rough-&-tumble, cigar chomping tough guy. As it goes, Van Damme doesnt do a very good job in either role, although his take on Alex is mildly amusing. It is puzzling as to have the brothers mistaken for each other, with them wearing different clothes & having different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung makes a very worthy henchman for the baddies.#0
3730_2#First off there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message. So my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations. As a Christian, though an amillenialist, I believe there will be a great tribulation and I believe Christ will return as he said as much. So even though I have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why I rate this movie so low. There are great Christian films, with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. Im surprised the MST3K crew never lampooned this one.#0
6712_9#I love Sabrina! Its one of my fave shows  My favourite episodes are; the one where she turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series. I do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were better than the last series which was awful. Valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were amazing, and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went! Libby was a good character too. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just werent as good as her other friends.#1
9873_7#Lily Mars, a smalltown girl living in Indiana, dreams of making it big on Broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her, but he just gets annoyed with her antics. When Thornway goes back to New York to stage his show, Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show, only as a favor to her family, however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms, which makes the shows leading lady, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel gets fed up with the John-Lily romance causing friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play, which also may jeopardize the romance. Very charming film, and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth, while supposed to be humorous, never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed Heflins character (Thornway) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than be the romantic. The film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes werent assembled that well together, but a very enjoyable film. Rating, 7.#1
12215_1#In what I can say was a theft of my time I was taken to see this movie and I must say what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer. The plot is thin to say the least, the Cantonese dialog is not funny. See this movie at your peril. In short this movie was a total waste of time and space. Ive seen better movies on youtube.#0
10042_1#Such a long awaited movie.. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day.. From the trailers it looked like a action movie, but it turned out to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, theyve done their part of the movie very well. Good acting, but i dont think that can save the movie.. India has been shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-) And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins, just to make sure audiences dont forget the movie name i guess..#0
3756_1#It really is that bad of a movie. My buddy rented it because he, well, is an idiot. But then again, I must be an idiot too because I watched the whole damn thing! The actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think that are going places. The only place they will be going is back to waiting tables at Lubys. All I could think of while I was watching this  gem  was how it actually got made. I mean, some  screenwriter  actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return on it. Actors were cast, locations were scouted, make-up artists were hired, computer animators fresh out of Al Collins graphic Design School were brought in and this turd started to take form. After it was over, we decided to watch Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit then switching to a BMW 740il. You couldnt get two more opposite movies in terms of quality.#0
31_8#Once upon a time in a castle Two little girls are playing in the gardens castle. They are sisters. A blonde little girl (Kitty) and a brunette one (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kittys doll. Kitty pursues Evelyn. Running through long corridors, they reach the room where their grandfather, sitting on an armchair, reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn, while Evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly  I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady . Suddenly Evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kittys doll and then cuts her (the dolls) head. A fight ensues. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided. If youve liked  La Dama Rossa  check out also  La Notte che Evelyn uscì dalla Tomba .#1
11494_4#Richard Dix is a big, not very nice industrialist, who has nearly worked himself to death. If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? Well, hell likely be better off if he disregards the VOICE OF THE WHISTLER. This is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role.#0
6066_10#When I saw this movie first, it was long ago on VHS-Video. I did like this movie, because it was funny and excitingly. Some years ago I saw another movie, called  Andy Colbys Incredible Adventure  In this movie were parts of  Wizards of the lost kingdom  used in. They called this movie  KOR the conquerer . I began to search for the  KOR -Movie many years, because I wanted to see the complete movie, not only the parts which were used in the  Andy Colby -Movie. No shop had this Kor-Movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. Many years I watched my old VHS-tapes I had at home, and what a wonder I had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had much more time in watching  KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great during the hole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is walking drunken through the green forrest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both of them did their job very good. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thanks to all for reading my comment.#1
8154_10#Okay, my title is kinda lame, and almost sells this flick short. I remember watching Siskel & Ebert in 94 talking about this movie, and then playing a clip or two. Not being a rap-conscious guy (although I could identify Snoop Dogg, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer music), I wasnt much interested when they started talking about the film. But then, S&E showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name (using some  shady  logic and a bunch of  made up  facts), and then another scene where the band, and their rival band, both visit a school to promote getting involved (and, of course, NWH comes up with some  info  about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee). So I filed it away that I should see this movie. I did find it odd that NWHs managers suffered similar fates to Spinal Taps drummers (although none spontaneously combusted, I dont think). There were enough similarities that I cannot ignore the likelihood that Cundieff saw  Spinal Tap  prior to writing this film, although this is clearly much more the Spinal Tap of hip-hop. While some similarities exist, the humor is different, and the movie seems more like a real documentary (maybe because we dont recognize a single actor in this thing, even the guy who played  Lamar  from  Revenge of the Nerds ). All in all, this movie has, in my opinion,  street cred . Kinda like NWH.#1
601_7#I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary  edginess  is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.#1
6640_1#I find it rather useless to comment on this  movie  for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.Its similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it. But since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance   On the other hand this movie (among others) has some value whatsoever, an educational one for it sets the example for   How NOT to make a movie.  #0
8915_1#My comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which i find pretty offending, since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people. Please be tolerant of other peoples opinion. Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood, so ill change my comment completely. And so on. Its a waste of celluloid.#0
3273_9#Im giving it only 9 out of 10, because I need to view it again, in a more current mind-frame to have a fresh perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when I watched it. I would watch it every time it came on HBO back in the day (probably 1990 or so). I might have even recorded it, but that recording is long gone, Im sure. I would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere. Its interesting at the very least. If you enjoyed movies such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or anything sort of strange and along those lines, try this one out.#1
6748_4#Let me being by saying the I followed watching this video by watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though I thought it was only fairly good. Bleed is pretty bad. The best part is seeing the female cast nude. The gore is very fake looking and over-done. It has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and I didnt want to stay to see the horrible ending. If I could, I would ban these actors and actresses, the only reason being is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in over a hundred other videos and Ive also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures. They should not allowed to continue this madness.#0

2866_9#I grew up on this classic western series, and as a child always considered it a treat being allowed to stay up late on Sunday evenings to watch it. Bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs. This is a wonderful action packed western with great values. The Cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys quite villainous. If only there were more programs like this vintage western on TV these days!#1
55_9#At first I wasnt sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so I looked it up on IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so I thought I would give it a try expecting a movie like Elephant. Ive just got to say how much I loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it. I couldnt even get through Elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the Columbine tragedy. This movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic. Busy Phillips acting is OFF the CHAIN  That is a good thing and I would love to see her progress into some more mature roles.#1
2220_9#We tend to forget that the master/slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well-tended estates, powered by large groups of enslaved people, and a lot of money for the white owners. It lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves. I know it may sound callous, but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me, despite the sour taste I found in my mouth at what went on, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Watch it. If not read up on the period, because theres a lesson to be learned from it all.#1
1447_3#The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here. Two of those things were singing and dancing. Another was a short, interesting film that kept peoples attention and got their minds off The Depression. You know the other keys to Shirleys successful films. This film achieved none of the above, despite the star presences of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring, and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you didnt get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants. I guess they learned after this movie.#0
845_7#The Matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it, it seems so light. The humor is always medium-gauge, never unfunny but never gut-busting. The story is a very simple thread. The characteristics of the plot are often recycled features, namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straight-laced glass-wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each others lifestyles. I also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary, as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself. However, it really is a good film, because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time, it wasnt. It has a subtle way of connecting with the audience. The films climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists. But with its lightness, how can that possibly be the focus of the film, though the plot has been leading up to it? No, the focus is what Brosnan and Kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other. Strangely, The Matador is a film about regret and loneliness. Brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day, and though we dont understand why Kinnear is so lenient and accepting with Brosnan continually interrupting his life, its slowly understood that Brosnan is salvaging Kinnear from a more down-to-earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption. The very last scene of the movie stays with me. It, I think, is where the films subtle side-stepping impact finally begins to seep.#1
2598_10#As if the film were not of value in itself, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in NYC; that fall in graduate school, I read the book for the first time. Some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film. And for better or worse--and Ive now read and taught the novel for over three decades--Milo OShea is still Leopold Bloom.#1
11692_1#This movie was absolutely terrible. I cant believe I paid to see it in the theatre. I wouldnt watch it on free cable t.v. Im surprised that Joe Magtena even made it. Do not waste your time with this movie.#0
1590_1#HAH! So this is the movie that the  Next Action Stars  were getting into. Well Im glad that I didnt participate and didnt win Isnt it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds(!) and make up ones mind about a movie? I mean, come on! Just look at those titles!? I watched this movie(or part of this  teleplay  since it was produced for TV and we couldnt bear to watch the whole thing) one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge-podge of average guys that once in a while watch series like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show. so the bar wasnt really high, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and it wasnt because of the great script ;D . But this movies total lack of originality, acting, scripting, and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to Las Vegas (or was it CSI? dont remember) without any complaints by the rest of the group. And that is rare(!) For heavens sake! Dont by this movie! If its on TV, then yes, watch it. And contemplate on it. My conclusion? well, since Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best action-films out there (Die Hard, Matrix 1, to name some) I can only say that producers dont give the film its quality, they provide money for the directors. And to sell this movie just because its a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it.#0
9418_2#This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re-naming. It doesnt work at all. Firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong. Its very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end. But there is also (and that may have to do with the cuts) an uneasy moving between genres. It starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the ending may be funny but its also so blunt that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence (what little there is). So the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all. You can also see that in the very unsteady character development.You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles rather than one.#0
11710_4#There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, the film stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin spouse. Oh, but not by conventional means. She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice. She wants Nichole (as Tuesday) to get close to her ex (the handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins, who should stick to music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good in his few brief moments, and former  Crime Story  star Anthony Dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl. Hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful, then evil and devious. She also handles vulnerable and  maybe a bit psychotic  well. Shes also quite hot (though theres no naughty bits show) so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at. But the performance is kind of wasted in this movie, which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend.#0
8763_9#This movie is cold, bare truth. Often we think  oh no, that wont happen to me.  But it can. Drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly (or tricked) into doing things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them, only wanted a exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare. People need to know that these sort of events arent improbable or exaggerated - this IS a major problem in todays society. I would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie. It is very emotional and raw. Well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory.#1
8446_1#Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen Can somebody tell me where should have I laughed? Theres not a single hint or shadow of an idea. The three leading actors are pestilential, especially the one (I think its Aldo) from Sicily who _cant_ make a Sicilian accent  Not to say about the dream-like insertion about Dracula just another expedient, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this  film  last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was really too, too hard to rescue. I would have given it  0  10, but the lowest mark was 1/10 and so I had to overestimate it by one mark.#0
6758_4#Quite possibly the nicest woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie gives another fine performance here. Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this film. ACTING $ (The acting is sub standard to say the least. Rochon is always a treat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character in American Nightmare was superior. Danny Wolske does a fine job as Debbies object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about).#0
9425_10#A super comedy series from the 1990s (Two series were made in total) that suffered in the UK ratings due to poor scheduling.

11262_7#THE DEVILS PLAYTHING is my second attempt at a Joseph Sarno production - and although I will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS, it is still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste. THE DEVILS PLAYTHING is a pretty good example of early 70s exploit sleaze. Lots of nudity - including some full-frontal, some sleazy undertones - including incest and of course, lesbo-bloodsuckingbut these scenes are still pretty tame by todays standards. Some pretty hot women in this one, would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but I guess ya cant have it all. Also would have benefited from some heavier violence/gore, being that it IS a vampire film, but I think the purpose of THE DEVILS PLAYTHING was more to showcase skin, not blood. Still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but thats to be expected from something from this era and of this budget. Worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking. 7/10#1
12001_8#I dont know what movie some of these other people watched, but they must have seen a different  Joseph Smith Prophet of the Restoration  than the one I saw. I would definitely recommend watching this movie.#1

Who is the killer and why is the killer after them?  While Valentines Day is no masterpiece, its a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more.#1
2153_2#The 3-D featured in  The Man Who Wasnt There  stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy features lousy 3-D effects that makes the 3-D effects in  Jaws 3 ,  Amityville 3 , and  Friday the 13th Part 3  look better by comparison. Not to mention the movie is asinine to the extreme. This was one of many 1983 movies to feature the pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor got trapped in this mess, but at least it didnt kill their careers. Tambor would go on to star on HBOs  The Larry Sanders Show  and Ron Howards box office smash  How the Grinch Stole Christmas , while Guttenberg followed this flop with  Police Academy  and  Cocoon . What them in those projects instead of them here in  The Man Who Wasnt There . If you do, youll regret it. 1/2  (out of four)#0
3760_7#It may have not been up for academy awards and admittedly, its pretty cheesy, but its just so much fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Lovable, optimistic, and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a great way to unwind. Although I love Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is funnier to me. Death is flippin hilarious and Bill and Ted are even more endearing. People give me grief about loving this movie, but only really pretentious movie-watchers will say its not even a bit entertaining. If you like this, youll probably also be a fan of Waynes World, Dude Wheres My Car, and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, though foolish, they make you grin and turn your tickle box over. So watch them just for kicks and giggles #1
6730_10#I used to write comments at IMDb, but I dont do so anymore. It happens that IMDb has become massive, and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores. What do I mean? That anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesnt have any expertise on the subject, watches some crap (or the opposite), and in case he likes it, delivers a 10, and if he doesnt he goes for a 1. This of course, cannot measure anything correctly. Now for the film. I truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films, because then I must score this one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something that I dont expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film. It is simply mesmerizing, and its not just a way of saying; it really is. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys-, that really theres no possible match. I dont keep movies, rarely would I find any sense in doing so, but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by. I got nothing more to say. This is a genuine, objective 10 for me.#1
9484_3#If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low score 3/10. I kept thinking  I could make a movie like this with my home video camera  throughout the film.#0
723_8#Riff Randell is a wildly, obsessed fan of the rock group; The Ramones and so are most of the students in the school. But a new tyrant of a principal, Ms. Togar thinks rock n roll is a bad influence on the students, especially the music from The Ramones. So, when Riff finds out theyre performing in town, she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends. But when Ms. Togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets. While, this is happening Tom Roberts is totally love struck over Riff, but Riffs friend Kate Rambeau feels the same way about Tom. But Riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer Joe Ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song. Theres no beating around the bush here when I say Rock n Roll High School is an intoxicating hoot, of a rad time!#1
692_8#I first saw this movie at a festival. There were many good movies, but few kept me thinking about it long after, and An Insomniacs Nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker. The shots were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted. There wasnt a lot to know about his character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him. And Ellen-- I cant wait to see where she ends up! Shes showing a lot of talent and I hope she does a few more films. With all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill, Tess shows that its all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors. Kudos to everyone involved with this film. And thanks to Tess and co. for distributing it on DVD!#1
810_1#If you are one of the people who finds  According to Jim  great television comedy, this is going to rock your world. And might I add, kudos for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC, which prefers to air crap like Jim Belushis show year after year. If you enjoy Jims work, this movie is your reward.#0
7879_4#First off, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing to me. The movie cuts out some characters, and misses a lot of the main points of the book. It skips around a lot, and doesnt explain anything in detail. If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie to me, was the ending. The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of  melting  together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs. To sum up, I dont think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.#0
11316_8#(Some spoilers) I have not read the James M. Cain novel (`The Postman Always Rings Twice) on which this movie was based, so I cannot compare this film version to it, but I have seen and love the 1946 US version (also entitled `Postman). A minor quibble The amount of time (hardly any) that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no botched first attempt as in the U.S. version); Ginos very quick-to-escalate relationship with the dancer/hooker  they quickly profess their love as well, and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met!  all rather unrealistic, isnt it? I found this time-frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that I must have missed something somewhere. Otherwise, well worth the viewers time. The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout. Recommended.#1
6328_4#Why does this movie fall WELL below standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humourless script. A slim/average looking Travolta (looking rather dapper in black I must say, even with a HUGE mullet) and Gross both act very well as two young-ish slick-dressed but nevertheless dimwitted New Yorkers eager to open their own nightclub. Other than that, the rest of the film is just boring to watch. It is SO dull that its really not worth knowing what happens in the films climax on any level. Kelly Preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband-to-be Travolta is one of the films few pleasures. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch as struggling KGB honcho  Bob Smith . Personally, I think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from NY to Indian Springs, Nebraska (which is in the former Soviet Union?)--youll understand if you see the movie Apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release. I guess Paramount stalled on releasing the movie until January 1989 because of the unbelievable plot. It was reported they deemed it  unreleasable . Nevertheless, this $6,000,000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing $163,000 in revenue as it was released only BRIEFLY in places like Texas and Colorado before heading straight-to-video. This is testament to the overall BAD quality of this movie.#0
7242_7#1933 seemed to be a great year for satires ( Duck Soup  for instance) and this one fits in well even though it is about the obsession with contract bridge. The tone is like a humorous piece from The New Yorker, appropriate, since the film begins with the  Goings On About Town  page of that magazine. The only thing odd is the casting. Made a few years later William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, you wouldnt have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in some shear and slinky outfits, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio. Even if you know nothing about bridge, you may still want to check out a rare example of Hollywood satire.#1
11446_2#My family and I screened Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog is ( my four year old loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this movie, was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg in the face for making this movie. I will admit however, that the soundtrack was good. I wasnt sure if the movie was set in the 80s, but with the majority of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station. Or if you are dead set on watching this, people under the influence might enjoy it.#0
5721_4#I wasnt at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit  Hostel , and most of these lame ass knock-offs are just as bad or worse - yet  Live Feed  managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes. Started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese Organized Crime Squad and a 7-foot, leather-aproned butcher What put me out of the movie was the tough hero with the guns and a grudge saving the day I would call this movie mediocre, at best, since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater, doubling as a hideout for the mafia, is appealing to me. If only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective, then my rating would have differed greatly. Unfortunately, most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene, leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge-type scenario. So, basically, it IS just a low-budget  Hostel  rip-off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex, almost constant during the first half of the film Overall, I would say dont bother with this one.#0
6931_8#By 1955, five years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together, four of them Westerns. Their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a Universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic. Buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and thats not counting Ray Teal or Anthony Curtis, later to become Tony. Perhaps ten years later the psychological western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel, to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way, and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned. One to add to the DVD collection.#1
8656_9#In the same vein as Natural Born Killers, another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that I also loved, Kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence, but I like to think that it turns that around in the final act. Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good. David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler, an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend, who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, I dont know where, places where nudity passes for art. Maybe it really does and I just dont understand it. At any rate, Brian and Carrie (Duchovny and Michelle Forbes, who fits the role flawlessly), make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites. Brian, the writer, will write the book, Carrie can take the pictures. Its easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder, but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audiences understanding of its subject matter. A film that didnt glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as Kalifornia, but the movie structures it perfectly. The glorification is all embodied in Brians and Carries fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with Early and Adele. The movies very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.#1
7530_3#I found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow  upbeat  ending that didnt ring true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isnt my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and I got very tired of its  one note  theme and couldnt wait for it to end--in fact I almost stopped about halfway through. The whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. A small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didnt make it with me, and I love good, small films! This one just didnt jell, though I kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their  Years 10 Best  list. Id strongly recommend watching  The House of Sand  instead--now theres a good, small film #0
8920_1#but this has to be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of all time. And that takes some doing, what with the likes of various Lifetime efforts. Dont get me wrong--I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. Ive enjoyed her tremendously in other roles (look at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery. And chew it she does, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim tying into a Christmas goose. Give me the classics anytime Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception maybe of Scrooged, all the others are just over-the-top efforts to grasp the past, present, or future Spirit of Christmas.#0
4922_4#DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on Sky Movies in Britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until it`s first broadcast on network television tonight . Actually seeing as I`m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . My theory was proved right for the most part  There are some positives in DRACULA 2000 like the visuals for example . This is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot , but it`s something we should expect from Hollywood over the last few years - A very good looking movie that`s very dumb#0
3980_1#No ,Im not kidding. If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. Im serious. Their movies are exactly the same in every one, and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations, having a problem which they easily resolve, hoping to be popular, and getting new boyfriends. Think about it. If you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot, contact me and tell me its name. These  movies  are poor excuses to be on TV and go to other countries. There is a reason that the movies never go to theaters. Im sure that when they were really young and made some O.K. movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so that now that theyre, what, 17, they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studios money. Let me advise you, STAY AWAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! ITS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD #0
8554_1#The motion picture was, in all likelihood, made in the year 1930 and released in 1931. I would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era. Nevertheless, this particular Zane Grey plot appears to be very weak. Also, Gary Cooper was probably just learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by todays standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, not acceptable. Some of the actors performed well. Sadly, the Indians always get the short end in these early westerns. They were living on the land long before the white man came, but according to twisted history, they had no right to defend themselves.#0
652_2#I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least BRITTANY SNOWs performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It wasnt suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too. Overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW i think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake. Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.#0
7096_10#I had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film. At the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were  Awesome. Just awesome.  I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing so. #1
2243_7#I thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it. The actors were on top of their characters backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great. The music was lush and well-thought-out. It even had a decent twist of an ending. So whats with everyone voting it down? The story wasnt entirely fresh (felt like a remnant of  Running Man  with the whole television show idea), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public picks their Messiah certainly sounded true enough. It made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity. I gave it a 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original, for the most-part. Check it out if youre not too offended to see an entertaining film from Madrid, Spain, about possibilities of the coming modern Messiah to a TV near you.#1
4277_3#Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown (for example, John Wayne in  Sands of Iwo Jima ) tried his hand at a big musical with  I Dream of Jeanie.  Harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and, as it turned out, virtually no future, he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great American songwriter, Stephen Foster. This was what Hollywood was putting out two years before Brown v. Board of Education. Must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bed linen to the theater.#0
8864_1#After watching this, I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (This has passed over time). This film was utter garbage. First, they tried to recreate the ending from the first  Howling,  with incredibly bad make-up. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film! The plot sucks and the whole film is just AWFUL  A brother of a werewolf victim from the first film (From the look of it, it was SUPPOSED to be Dee Wallace Stone)teams up with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, lead by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked all the time. This is not even worth renting (Unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity.). Try to catch it on cable instead. It would be so chopped up, it may actually make sense.#0
5875_1#This film deals with two ex-football players who are Fred Williamson, (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey, (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who works at having sex talk over the telephone. Jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or hang out in a Sports Bar where all kinds of city things go on. There is lots of punches, killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big ZERO. Dont waste your time, this film cost me only 50 cents and that was too much.#0
1392_7#Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, theyve been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide. 7/10#1
5344_7#This is a very good Spanish movie but I am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was all about or when it was fought. Being a history teacher, I had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces. I doubt if this would be a big concern in Spain where this film was made, but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film. PS--If you dont know which side is which, the Republicans were mostly Socialists and they were backed by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the USA). The Nationalists were led by Franco and were aided by Portugal and the Fascist states of Germany and Italy.#1
12454_3#Ive been reading posts here concerning Wonder Womans costume for this TV movie. It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made, she wasnt wearing her traditional outfit. The producers were actually sticking to the comic book writers conception of WW for the early seventies. Of course, I wasnt at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! -)#0
11950_8#I went into this movie knowing nothing about it, and ended up really enjoying it. It lacked authenticity and believability- Some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre, and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad-libbed (perhaps this is typical of Woody Allen? Excuse my ignorance) but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard. It wasnt even at the jokes in the movie per se, but at the whole movie itself. The acting reminded me of Seinfelds acting, where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes- they are corny, but if you dont take the movie too seriously, you can really appreciate the humour of the ACTORS, not the CHARACTERS. If youre looking for a random movie, and you like Woody Allen, Id definitely recommend it!#1
5129_1#The message of this movie is  personality is more important than beauty . Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the  ugly duckling , but the funny thing is that shes not at all ugly (actually shes a lot more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model). #0
8898_8#The 60s is a great movie(I saw it completely in one night) about the hippy movement in the late 60s. Although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60s are not really important in this film. In the end,the 60s is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10#1
10253_1#Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! Im trying to view all of his work. He has been known to single-handedly save movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This movie suffers from a low budget and its production values are disturbing. Pleasefor the love of Christopher.avoid this film!#0
676_8#The Last Wave is far more than the sum of its parts. Its not merely a disaster film, not simply an exploration into Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than a simple court drama. Writer/Director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to Picnic At Hanging Rock two years earlier, that you will continue to remember years later. Put all these things together, and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on. Strongly recommended.#1
8232_10#Along with  Aparadektoi, the best Greek Comedy series ever ! Lefteris Papapetrou writes and Antonis Aggelopoulos directs in a magnificent way Soso, Alekos, Flora, Achilleas, Grandpa Aristides, Machi, Johnnie, Corrina and Michalis ! In a few words, Alekos, a butcher living in a district around the center of Athens is married to Soso. One day he meets Flora, an old date of his, who now is married to Achilleas and lives along with her father-in-law and his caretaker, Machi. Machi also has a son named Johnny who appears at the end of the first period and the entire second one. the rest main characters are Michalis, Alekoss assistant at the butchers and bi-sexual and Corrina, Achilleass lost sister who has turned up to be the best prostitute in the entire Athens. The main story of the series is Sosos attempts to kill Alekos, because he is cheating on her, but everything else happening in that are not of lower importance. Brilliant screenplay, with an excellent plot, poisonous quotes, awesome performances and a great directing. Original idea and especially the shootings were something that was done at the Greek television, for a series of the Greek television, for the first time, e.g. scenes shot under water ! Surely a serial you will never stop enjoying  #1
2793_9#Its such a shame that because of its title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. The story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy, the jokes were laugh out loud funny, and the characters are well acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in great performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in Ride with the Devil, comes across so well as the nice guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you dont like football, go see this film. If anything itll make you smile.#1
12434_10#For a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance. It is done with style and class showing Modestys early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world. I think it is a very honest/true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer Peter ODonnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice. She acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool/intelligent/innocence. And full marks to Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more believeable to have a new face creating the part. Im looking forward to the next film.#1
12487_3#This film was a big disappointment. I really love every one of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.#0
6485_10#The world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2.  #1
2355_7# but I enjoyed this show anyway. Ive been reading some of the comments prior reviewers have had to say about this show, and Im having a hard time completely nullifying all the criticism in my own head (except one that the show was stale; this program was ANYTHING but stale). A lot of the stuff people take issue with about this show is on the money pretentious; forced; overwrought; desperate for attention; self-satisfied; annoying ever-present narration. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, it really, really TRIED; and that made up for all the minuses. The show was bright, verbal, quick, witty, interesting, fun to look at  you know, it was only on once a week, I could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it. I will mourn its passing. But I guess nobody will be bringing this back to life.#1
6867_9#I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80s and 90s. I watched the Groove Tube for the first time in 2001, when I was 19. So for anybody who thinks that something  dated  cant be quite funny 30 years later.think again! Its funny even if you have no idea what the 70s were like, and the thought of bell-bottom pants make you cringe. Who can argue with a Bozo the Clown type who reads adult literature? There is plenty to laugh at. The scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.#1
9643_2#Below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music??? Ordinary Script & Direction with full of blunders. Salman Khan was at his usual acting. Ajays performance deteriorating with time as his looks,especially his styles as a Rock Star were pathetic. Asin was just a showpiece only. Overall I felt like wasting my money in cinema. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the movie all boring except  Man Ko Ati . The Most Important Song to impress the UK Music Sponsor was most unimpressive.  Khanabadosh  can be very easily understood by an English Music Sponsor. The other movie I saw last week was  Wake Up Sid  which was simple slow love story with good direction & acting despite average music#0
5584_8#I cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally. As a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema. I first encountered movies at the end of WWII through Roger Manvilles splendid Penguin book  Film , which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that I wish I could buy another copy to re-read today. My introduction to many classics films such as The Battleship Potemkin, Drifters (Griersons magnificent documentary), Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, and Ecstasy; came first through this book and later at my University Art-house cinema. Ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the Vatican, for condoning Evas desertion of Emil, her subsequent divorce, and the brief swim she took in the buff, but Roger Manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant, outstandingly beautiful, visual paean to love - a view echoed by many IMDb users. A very lonely young man, when I saw it, I willingly concurred. No further opportunity to see Ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos - by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed. Quite recently I finally added Ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial. Ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence, against which individual lives are insignificant - perhaps a tribute to what Bernard Shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term The Lifeforce.  Two further thoughts; firstly this is a Czech film, released there in 1933. Its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of Nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations (I do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when I first saw this film - were they removed from the copy I saw then?). Secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime. We should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience.#1
5049_3#A group of us watched this film are were really disgusted. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo wasnt on (its not like the writers/producers could do anything about that). The writing was poor, the script was sub-par. What REALLY annoyed us 1. When the two guys realized they were both dating Natalie, they didnt just leave they put up with that stupid (and ultimately degrading) contest - but only because they were macho competing guys, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy, its as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film). 3. Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.#0
11212_8#This picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last that we saw Sheriff Pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed Sunday morning drive. After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that hes after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes. The only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story. How could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet dont do anything about it. Since there was real no name actress in this picture I cant give it 10 weasel stars but I can give 8#1
7596_3#A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity. Her question  Not even Colin Farrell could save it?  My response  Not even Colin Farrells ass could save it.  #0
983_4#When Marlene Dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers, it was films like The Garden Of Allah. How a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. Also how Marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me. Anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. Most especially Marlene Dietrich. I would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot.#0
4629_10#My father was the warden of the prison (he is retired now) showcased in this documentary and Ive grown up around the prison life, so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie. I will say this, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to A) Show up and tell this story, B) Get inside these inmates minds and hearts, and C) Do all of this responsibly. Responsible to their art and, more importantly, responsible to the inmates and staff of Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They should be commended without end for this work. To take 170 hours, yes HOURS, of footage and be able to cut and whittle it down to 93 riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respect. This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life, and the inmates held within it. Oz is not real, television is not real. Shakespeare Behind Bars is.#1
4115_8#This is one of the weirder movies I have recently watched. Thats because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film. Kurasawas experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences. Not every episode is depressing and harsh, but overall this is definitely the tone. Lets see,we have a case of incest/rape, attempted murder, wife swapping, alcoholism, infidelity, death of a little boy after eating tainted fish, a man with severe depression (he never talks during the movie and looks very scary), a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments  driving  his street car through paths among the garbage piles, a man married to a total shrew (I think I liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist!), etc., etc. In fact, it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an Ingmar Bergman movie set in Japan, as Bergman made MANY movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life. Is it any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself?! So, did I like it? No. It was not a fun experience. But, it was a very well-made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was sort of like watching a train wreck--you dont WANT to see all the carnage but you cant help but watch! Of all the vignettes, I think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didnt really seem to fit in (he was too well-adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump) was perhaps meant to represent Kurasawa himself. Maybe. I dunno. If youve seen a variety of Kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films, give this one a watch. However, do NOT make this your first experience watching his movies--its sure to scare away many viewers #1
9092_3#Friz Frelengs Speedy Gonzalez was the second cartoon to feature the title character after Robert McKimsons Cat-tails for Two. In that cartoon, Speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. Despite looking significantly more handsome, Speedy never developed into much of a character. A big hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not a classic character make and thats pretty much all Speedy ever had going for him. Nevertheless, the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studios latter days. While these early Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently (rather oddly) paired up with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula. In this self-titled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat. Although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon, Sylvesters role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable. undemanding role of pursuer. This was always a problem in the Tweety cartoons too but Speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come. Despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs, Speedy Gonzalez won an Oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born.#0
4066_3#In director Eric Stanzes ISOYC, IPOYG, three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat his own crap, before being axed to death. The next bloke ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guys corpse. But its the third man who gets it the worst he has to watch the heavily tattooed star Emily Haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle (oh, he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too!). Strangely enough, I give ISOYC, IPOYG a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. Thats one point for the messy axe attack (which, being a gore-hound, I actually enjoyed); one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse masquerading as feces (hilarious); and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to Meir Zarchis superior exploitation classic I Spit On Your Grave.#0
7300_8#Like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title, Michael Oblowitzs latest production has grace, but its also slow and ponderous. The producers last outing,  Mosquitoman-3D  had the same problem. Its hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow managed it. The only draw for Hammerhead Shark Frenzy was its passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans surface. But even that was only passable. Poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish. With Dolphins and Whales, the technology is all but wasted. Cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAXs stunning 3D capabilities. There are far too few scenes of any depth or variety. Close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field, so there is no contrast of depth. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps, but when youve got Shark-Week on cable, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.#1
12298_4# Witchery  might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80s but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay doesnt make one iota of sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who cant seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the places dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. Theyre forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of  The Evil Dead . The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. Theres something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.#0
7155_8#More than just a  kids movie ,  Holes  looks at how past incidents still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long, he discovers a number of things about the camp, and his personal connection to it. Through flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (youll understand this better when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a pretty good job, as do the other cast members Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.#1
10103_1#This movie had me going. The title was perhaps the greatest idea that I heard. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the US and a group of lone survivors, band together, and plan to take out the zombies. DEAD WRONG! Its about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets whats coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge. As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved. Where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation. First off, the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies but mindless, debatable intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies. Sure the eating and killing is there, but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of that genre and asks the question,  why cant zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines?  I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much, its an insult and as for scarynot even.#0
11881_9#Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Dont expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from  Scarface . This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled  American Dream . Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial.  Scarface  is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10#1
5697_3#This is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story, not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of Irish locations. If the great M.R. James had ever come up with a tale this thin -- doesnt James in fact have a story called  A Thin Ghost ? -- he wouldnt have bothered to have it published. Orson Welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends, this films producers. His presence and the one movie industry in-joke would have earned this will-o-the-wisp its Oscar nomination. This is yet more proof, if any more were needed, that the Academy Awards have never been any guarantee of merit.#0
5441_1#Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain.  How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy ? Gary Busey is know for his  B  movies, but this is a sure  W  movie. (W=waste). Take for example about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is  confused  as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.#0
8306_1#ETs obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention shell most likely grow up psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy. Now poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a recluse and said  I want to be alone . How much does ET make off this little girl? Does ET not have anything better to report on? I bet theres lots of people who really dont care what color her birthday cake and balloons were. By the way, I never heard that Anna Nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance. Who is paying for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and little Dannielynn? Could it be ET?#0
512_10# Stairway to Heaven  is a outstanding invention of movie making, probably never duplicated. I rank it with  The Wizard of Oz  and  African Queen,  although it is a totally different type of movie than  African Queen.   Stairway to Heaven  is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique.  If you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me.  Stairway to Heaven  is a true gem.#1
2679_3#(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy  actioner  (and I use the term loosely) that Ive been trying to watch for over a year. Ive finally gotten to the end and now I wish I didnt put in the repeated effort. 4 out of 10. Its about four hours (all my attempts to see this) Ill never get back. Only for those who want to see a brooding Russian action film with very little action#0
1619_1#At the beginning of the movie, the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were amazing. However, the story was so very slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest, and frequently see foxes. One thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild, and enjoy them from afar. This movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it, in trying to make a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a horrible story it tells. The final narrated dialog was so stupid, by which time my wife and I were screaming at the TV! I absolutely hated this movie, and would never recommend it to anyone!#0
9290_9#This is very much not the sort of movie for which John Wayne is known. He plays a diplomat, a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action. The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story. All in all, an excellent film.#1

11572_8# In April 1946, the University of Chicago agreed to operate Argonne National Laboratory, with an association of Midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research. Argonne thereby became the first  national  laboratory. It did not, however, remain at its original location in the Argonne forest. In 1947, it moved farther west from the  Windy City  to a new site on Illinois farmland. When Alvin Weinberg visited Argonnes director, Walter Zinn, in 1947, he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site. When Zinn described a heavy-water reactor operating at one-tenth the power of the Materials Testing Reactor under design at Oak Ridge, Weinberg joked it would be simpler if Zinn took the Oak Ridge design and operated the Materials Testing Reactor at one-tenth capacity. The joke proved unintentionally prophetic.  The OSS Society® 6723 Whittier Ave., 200 McLean, VA 22101#1
8833_9#I was intrigued by the title, so during a small bout of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity), I stayed up and watched it. I then checked my TV listings and watched it again! There is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when I saw this film- in spite of politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers everywhere are virtually the same. The characters of the kids from Belgrade could have been transported to, lets say, somewhere in the American Midwest during the same time period, and language differences aside, would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era. They certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations, politics aside Music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music As a matter of fact, much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970s Southern California. This was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were completely believable also. I wont say this was the Yugoslav  American Graffiti , but I will say that it fits in nicely with other 50s-themed movies.#1
3017_7#Philo Vance had many affinities with Bulldog Drummond He was a gentleman with the kind of polish and elegance only usually associated with the British upper classes and he was also independently wealthy William Powells elegance and suavity made him the perfect Vance and although a year later he switched studios, he stayed in the same genre with the enormously successful and popular  The Thin Man  at MGM#1
311_1#I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for the writing, if thats what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell  I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $10,000 and they were way under. Did Wallmart get a good deal on this? Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend anymore #0
7306_3#Truly one of the most dire films Ive ever sat through. Ive never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film-making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest. There were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense (e.g. when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases? When would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure? Why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed?). Also, the characterisation - as weve almost come to expect in such films - was awful (e.g. the way the blonde guy - I dont remember his frickin name and dont give a toss anyway - completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her) and I ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends! The production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about.#0
8111_8#Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in its Utopian ideals. Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring. Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. There is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of artisans, not industrialists.#1
319_9#Wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary.#1
849_1#One Star. Thats all this documentary deserves. I havent felt this disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documentary, in quite some time. And does it make sense to learn that this doc was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series? Hmmm#0
8117_8#I first saw this film 40 years ago on N.Y. television, and thought it was a depressing look at the future. Wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing. (  no private airplanes . The 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to British film goers doing the war. The concept of the future, and the Korda an Co. concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film. The very best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss. A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from Absolutely Fabulous comedy series. It is interesting to note that the Bosss negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time Churchill.#1
5621_10#Meek, tiny, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it. In front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces I had the pleasure to see and see and see again. It never lets me down. People, even people who know me pretty well, thought/think there was/is something wrong with me, based on my attraction, or I should say, devotion for  Le Locataire  They may be right, I dont know but there is something irresistibly enthralling within Polanskis darkness and I havent even mentioned the humor. The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that takes over him and, naturally, us, me. That building populated by great old Academy Award winners Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is compulsory viewing. One, two, three, many, many viewings.#1
10987_4#I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwoods novel The Robber Bride, and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version. A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead womans crazy female friends. Its fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms. Atwoods clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a mans story. I normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as is. If I hadnt read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, youre out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. Its the same plot the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst. Its like Zenias revenge on Margaret Atwood.#0
11276_10#Hard to believe, perhaps, but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose Hayes Code. Yes indeed, priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin. Lets hear it for artistic freedom, feminist Jane, and sex.#1

8752_9#I have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now. Brokedown Palace has that `hard to believe aspect, however with the ingenious directing, and screenplay, Palace scores big.   There are a few twists and turns that will, by the end of the movie, have you in tears. This is one of those movies that you have most likely passed by when searching for that movie to watch at home. It is my opinion that the next time out at the video store, do not pass by this one again.#1
8058_8#Like many people here, I started out finding my patience being tried by this film. By the end, I actually shed a few tears. 8 of 10. And the fault for it not being 10 of 10 is my own and in some measure yours, if you are reading this. We have all asked for more, ever more, faster, ever faster until we cannot put ourselves in 1935 -- just yesterday, really -- as easily as we should be able.#1
586_1#After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River, WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It just wasnt the same without Spur and Harrison, as portrayed by Douglas. Maybe he recognized how poor the plot was--Jim returns after extended absence, to find Jessica being pursued by another man. He could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him, and not find competition. For a Disney movie, this contains foul language, plus the highly unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica shacked up without being married--very LAME. Quite an insult to viewer intelligence, according to members of my family. Ill stick with the first one, and try to forget I ever saw the sequel!#0
2933_3#If you have read the book - do not set your hopes high, if you have not - go read it, and never watch the film. It is strange to learn that Toby Young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script (as he claims himself in the post script of the book). Because the film is very different from the book. You are better off not seeing it.#0
11539_9#THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simons most famous play about a TV newswriter named Felix Unger, who is an obsessive neat freak, who moves in with his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, a sportswriter and complete slob, after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it. Neil Simons classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar, a one-of-a-kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout. This teaming of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re-visited in nine other films. With both of these actors no longer with us, the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious. Simons play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed Felixs suicide attempt that is a winner. The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines, and David Sheiner as Oscars poker playing buddies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters, blind dates of Oscar and Felix. Of course, it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but theres nothing like the original. A joy from start to finish.#1
12062_10#This film has been scaring me since the first day I saw it. So obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me. It scared the s    out of me. Ive been immune to horror films since watching this #1
8437_3#As a big fan of David Mamets films and plays, especially his first film House of Games that also starred Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things from this film. Instead, I found myself annoyed by the films superficiality and lack of credibility. Racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them, in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized. Identity is totally reevaluated and men become  heroes  for no apparent reason. Because of his oaths taken as a cop, the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives, and yet performs another action which is very violent and VERY illegal, but then still refuses the minor action. In addition, a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting, and the cops reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after expecting another exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10.#0
8035_1#This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen Unfortunately, I am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless its not made for t.v. When looking at the box it says it is rated R for gore and some language Where was the gore? Was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore? I could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue. There wasnt even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie. Sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid, but this was just sad.#0
10857_1#Check out the films website, more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie. It couldnt be more off in its boasting. Original story? Original? They must have found the script tucked away between the old testament, or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn-tooting. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of earwax. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, the Americas funniest home video look is still a classic. Im sure they had little money available for this title, so of course the sf arent really that good, or a bit bad now and then, or just plain hilarious, but its the story that makes this film a waste of time and money. 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen-befores and done-alreadys.#0
5269_1#This movie was lame, lame, lame. What a build up! What a let down. All form, no substance. A terrible waste of talent and time. Would not recommend it to my husbands dog, who will watch anything.#0
12118_7#When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble. Condensing the gigantic W. Somerset Maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen. But you know, the movies not half bad, and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers. Grade B+#1
5745_3#This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasnt just a nominee but it won  I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre. By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixars success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it? This seems unlikely.#0
121_4#Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. Ive never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.#0
8667_3#This sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk. The first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. Most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other.  By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years old in here.#0
5829_3#I watched this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibit. It certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the exhibit and, in retrospect, probably should have. Bottom line unless you really get off on Barneys sense of art, dont bother seeing this movie. The message is obscure, the pace slow, and the cultural references pretentious. If youre after shock-art, youll do better at one of the many  Undead  movies or hunting down an old copy of Hustler and taking in a fecal-cartoon.#0
11721_7#The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer. Best Quote Bob Redding Hows your head? Elvira I havent had any complaints.#1
582_3#Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, particularly the nature of addiction, which still resonate strongly today. As for the movie eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and CIRCLING around everything, making the viewer quite nauseous. Why the director didnt put a stop to this is beyond me--but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately-cast actors. All in all, a weak adaptation. Your three hours would be better spent reading (or re-reading) the book.#0
10037_1#I had never thought the standard of Yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent! The film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest. Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.#0
9442_10#Deliverance is a stunning thriller, every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach-churningly frightening. Though it is not a horror movie, it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film. The very thought of being a normal red-blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation, only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies, is surely the worst nightmare of 99.9% of the worlds population. It would have been easy for Deliverance to slip into exploitation territory, but John Boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores, questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity. With so many films, you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the heros shoes, performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl. but with Deliverance, you come away praying to God that youll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through. Deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale, but even more powerful (and disturbing) as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters. Though all the performances are remarkable, one must take particular note of Beattys efforts in a role that many actors wouldve turned down. The film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film Straw Dogs - both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales, and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction. The backdrop of the rugged countryside in Deliverance is beautiful to look at, but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape, with nobody to rely on other than themselves. This truly is suspenseful film-making at its finest.#1
11608_1#If this guy can make a movie, then I sure as hell can make one too. So, if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count on me wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire.#0
3690_9#Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je taime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, yearnings and expectations. I give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop, but not all of them and that is the thing that I find missing, and by  further development  I do not mean some specific reference to the characters future. As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- captivating. Makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to Paris and live those little romances yourself.#1
6738_7#Where the Sidewalk Ends is quite a good film-noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well. Rating 3 stars out of 5.#1
3201_10#This is an early film  Pilot  for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys. It was played to executives at a few networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around  exterminating  peoples pets for money. If you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series. I highly recommend it! Its not too offensive either (they dont actually show killing animals)#1
11222_3#Cybil Richards directs another Full Moon/Surrender Cinema masterpiece of erotica. This time Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in rather fetching silver outfit) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However she cant resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them. The sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack (at least for this sort of film). The cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too. Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below. She also fits in a little lesbian activity. To be honest Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare. Here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the drama. Utterly rubbish movie with Lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features. Mediocre even for Surrenders output and clearly a new budget low for them also.#0
6720_2#Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Sadly and annoyingly, here it is, flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute)or is that cliché piled upon cliché. No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sants GERRY.. and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight? Well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didnt get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own. Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the unrequited loves a bore theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left. The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform, I can understand why.#0
11270_10#Make no mistake, Maureen OSullivan is easily the most gorgeous Jane ever, and there will never be one more gorgeous. She is visually stunning. That aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. This is a great film. It not only has the classic Tarzan aura, but also the feel of the continuing saga. We become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other, a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history.And these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic. There is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted. However, the Africans are depicted as individuals, and at the end, two even become more heroic than the white hunters, and stand out as such. In fact, the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. The finale, also, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great lion attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction. If I left anything out, it is because I do not want to soil the picture for those who havent seen it. But it is everything you could want in a movie.#1
671_7#I remember seeing this when it was released, in a theater in Palo Alto, and not expecting much. I mean -- an Australian movie? But it finally got to me. Heres a scene. Richard Chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in Sidney, facing an Australian aborigine elder named Charlie. But I dont care about that. Taken as a film, this one is pretty good, and its especially important for marking the celebrity of the director, Peter Weir, and the Australian film industry. This was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes, some of them raucous, like  Mad Max,  and some subtle and dramatic, like  Lantana.  I like Weirs stuff, which resembles Nicholas Roegs in being pregnant with subliminal dread. Try  Picnic at Hanging Rock  for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood.#1
2921_10#The One and only was a great film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I dont think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. Sad, funny, and all around GREAT       10+#1
593_1#This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Worse than the most abhorrent American dross; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea. its not. It is abject rubbish from very bowels of Satan himself (who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, spending our tax payers money (lottery money folks) on this piece of nonsense, should be accountable. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline??? I ask you - camp as a Christmas Tree, Deathline  Mind the doors is classic of really bad British film, we really dont need a reminder. And we certainly dont need a poor, second rate, badly scripted, badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this. All this this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men I rest my case. I am staggered at the low, low standard of this film. It makes me Mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry whilst idiots are running the show. Harvey Wienstein where are you? Come back, we forgive you #0
2983_7#BASEketball is indeed a really funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again, in a really silly, but many times smart, comedy. Vote 7.5 out of 10.#1
12333_1#Un-bleeping-believable! Meg Ryan doesnt even look her usual pert lovable self in this, which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick. Hard to believe she was the producer on this dog. Plus Kevin Kline what kind of suicide trip has his career been on? Whoosh Banzai  Finally this was directed by the guy who did Big Chill? Must be a replay of Jonestown - hollywood style. Wooofff!#0
9083_8#I enjoyed this movie and I had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews I read before going. I went because I was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans. Oh and its from Korea which has put out some of my favorite movies. I liked Host but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. Yes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its unusual quirky sense of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?#1
9988_2#Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is fine until an ex shows up and things get a little complicated.. While I was watching this movie there were several times i asked myself why I was doing so..because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted without any believability. Nor does the audience really car what happens..Even the lovely Cameron cant save this one on a scale of one to ten..2#0
3355_10#May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for historical appointment with Mussolini.Emotions , tensions and forms of self-affirmation. a empty town, a housewife and a journalist. The meeting of two different worlds. Refuge for a mother with a sad life. Short filling for a classical victim. A story about solitude and silence. About the form of of lifes nooks and desire like fights form. The great character- a book gifted in a springs afternoon. This movie is a poem, remarkable for the art to describe the shades of common loneliness. A pleading for a ineffable relation with reality. And with your interior world. The pictures of Il Duce, the clumsiness of Antonietta, the patience and the frailty tension of Gabriele, the art of director to give the sense of script grace two great actors makes this film sublime, foretaste of subtle delicacy, a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict, about essence of life and repulsiveness of any tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent acting. A clear masterpiece.#1
2891_2#Im starting to write this review during a break as I watch the movie. Its the first time Ive tried doing that, but Im having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks. Thats not because its intense but because its bad. Nope. Sorry. This rented turkey goes back tonight!#0
756_1#Normally when I write a review for a movie online, it is for one of three reasons. Either, I have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent, I feel that the publics perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons, or I believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers. While all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative, I find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as,  This is one of the best films of all time! , does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides, nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good, which should be the point of the review in the first place. With that being said, War of the Worlds is nothing more than a hurried, incompetent attempt at a money grab; piggy-backing its loathsome carcass on the multi-million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg. Many people will buy this DVD in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject. This movie is not even  so bad  that it becomes funny or endearing, rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger. Now with most of the insults out of the way, allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than I.  Now, as per IMDbs policy any spoilers must be announced in advance, no matter how small, so here is fair warning. The movie opens with a lot of inane small-talk, followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot. Seriously, it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube. It is very hard to describe every little issue in depth, but by the end of the first ten minutes, the combination of shaky camera-work, spliced scenes, and a LOT of walking begin to frustrate the viewer. However, the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going. The next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods, he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot. They both walk back to town. These walks arent two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged. They are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie. In a particularly grueling scene, the main character is shown looking at a pod, then he is shown pacing and panting, then he looks at the pod, then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town, then comes in to town and walks into a building, then he has a cup of coffee and says  Thank you Mary  to a random maid that serves him coffee, then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building, then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod. I apologize for the extreme run-on sentence, but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film. Characters speak way too long about mundane things, they walk a lot, they send other people to walk, the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed, but for no dramatic effect, simply the camera man is a sophomore at Tech somewhere. The editing is mind-bogglingly bad. People actions make little sense. For instance, when the professor goes to a farmers house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town, the farmer stutters and paces around. When the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside, the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later. Nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene, as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk. The entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film, but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion. I have seen better high school video productions. Finally, the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story. I get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage. However, it is so awful in technical aspects, and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad. Avoid this film at all costs.#0
5768_4#Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the lip syncing is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand whats going on, only to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting their time. I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time! This could of been an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. Im sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but sorry guys-story telling is what makes a movie.#0
10205_10#REnted this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didnt find out until i got home, watched it anyways. Absolutely FANTASTIC! a wonderful movie, and one of my top three favorite of all time, i recommend it to Everyone! Gotta find a copy somewhere..#1
11443_2#Heres one you can watch with a straight face, with a script so bad, even Will Ferrell wouldnt be in it. Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane mustve lost a bet to be here.#0
5374_3#THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most over-directed, over-the-top, over-everything mess Ive ever seen come out of France. Theres nothing worse than a French production trying to out-do films made in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror/action/buddy flick. I almost stopped it halfway through because I knew it wouldnt amount to anything but French guys trying to show-off. Its difficult to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA, which though had its share of problems, doesnt even come close to the awfulness of this overbaked, confused film.#0
9970_3#People who actually liked Problem Child (1990) need to have their heads examined. Who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny? The movie is not funny, ever, in any way, beginning to end. It wants to be a cartoon, but the writers dont realize that slapstick isnt funny when people get attacked by bears, or hit with baseball bats. It may be funny in cartoons, but not in a motion picture. Kids will enjoy this, but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen. And to most people, Problem Child will be considered a  guilty pleasure  classic; a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking, even though the prevailing opinion, as put forth by more serious viewers, is that the movie is a piece of crap.#0
7627_10#I remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland, it all came flooding back. Why this hasnt had a Video or DVD release yet? Its sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been. In fact this is the one John Carpenter film that hasnt been released. In fact i havent seen it on the TV either since the day i watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role he was born to play. John carpenters break from horror brought this gem that id love the TV to play again. It is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes. Belting out most of Elviss greatest hits with gusto. I think this also was the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big trouble in little china, and Escape from L.A. Someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life, which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has. If this doesnt get released then we are gonna be in Heartbreak Hotel.#1
7833_1#I just saw the third week of Stephen Kings Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; meaning, I saw 6 episodes so far. I have to say that the stories are really weak. I have read Stephen Kings Skeleton Crew, a collection of his short stories that was published way back. I recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent, if not outstanding. I tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories/script. If this was a movie, I would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such. I would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store. However, given that this is on TNT, a cable channel, I would say if you have not seen it already, then try it for one week. If you do not like it that week, then you will not like the past series nor the future ones, since they all share the same boring trait.#0
4417_1#I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college. I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a  good Catholic  in the churchs eyes because I dont believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to. At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Marys emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedythe tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former studentsthe lives of the aborted babies, the life of the students mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God. This is what is wrong with todays Islam, and yesterdays Judaism and Christianity.#0
7578_4#Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit  Love, American Style,  decked out with flashes of nudity,  Superchick  (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) whos so good-looking that even her planes autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin, swingin gal really does put the  lay  in  layover.  What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when shes not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, shes liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when youre feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. Disappointingly, buxom 70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles! Though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and doesnt really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it does succeed in being consistently amusing, and I suppose that is something. Strange that the end credits should call attention to Ms. Jillsons body double, however; dont think Ive ever seen THAT before #0
960_7#This is a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand. Even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort, but that just got wasted on me. Bottom line nice visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap.#1
6926_4#I got this in the DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD. You gotta love those bargain packs. For even if they dont feature true remastering, restoration and all that hoo-ha, and the films are generally in full-frame pan and scan format, theres no denying that there are always a few gems included. And by  gems , I mean theres always some good crap to be seen, especially if the films are from the 70s as The Mansion of Madness is. And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.#0
2584_1#So, American Pie Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Although, it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (cant that guy get better gigs?). There is very little to compliment this movie on. There arent any funny jokes. The acting is painful to watch, especially the girl with the  southern  accent which sounds more like a Canadians impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word  yall.  This movie makes me feel like such an idiot. Why didnt I apply to a college where nobody goes to class (but everybody gets good grades), girls consistently take their clothes off in public, everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs, and you can ejaculate all over a girls family photos without her minding? Really, this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn. Maybe for the next one, theyll finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead. Im sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character Stiflers 3rd uncle once removed or something like that.#0
1799_7#Im 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a great pair. This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are  You cant keep a good dog down  and that song about sharing, I think its called  Whats mine is yours . This was the last movie with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie but I find Itchys voice is so fun to hear. Although some scenes I actually found scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlies dream, and Carface scares the crap out of me. Other characters like King Gator I found really funny. The ending was adorable and was actually sad, made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.#1
750_8#Jodie Foster, Cherie Currie (the former lead singer of the seminal all-girl rock group the Runaways in her remarkably able acting debut), Marilyn Kagan, and Kandice Stroh are uniformly believable, splendid and touching as the titular quartet, who are a tight-knit clique of troubled, fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent, uncaring, self-absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent San Fernando Valley, California suburbs. The girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex, drugs, alcohol, commitment, and so on at a tender young age when theyre not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions. Foster, giving one of her most perceptive, affecting and underrated performances to date, is basically the groups den mother who presides over the well-being of both herself and the others; shes especially concerned about the good-hearted, but reckless and self-destructive Currie, whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end. This picture offers a poignant, insightful, often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken, dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbias neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families tough, resilient, but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent. Adrian ( Fatal Attraction,   Jacobs Ladder ) Lynes direction is both sturdy and observant while Gerald Ayres script is somewhat messy and rambling, but overall still accurate in its frank, gritty, unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kids nerve-wrackingly chaotic, capricious and unpredictable everyday life. Leon Bijous soft, dewy, almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence. Giorgio Moroder arranged the excellent score, which makes particularly effective use of Donna Summers elegiac  On the Radio.  The top-notch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Fosters neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, Scott Baio as a sweet skateboarder dude, Randy Quaid as Kagans rich older boyfriend, British 60s pop singer Adam Faith as Fosters feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and Lois Smith as Kagans smothering, overprotective mother. Appearing in brief bits are Robert Romanus (Mike Damone  Fast Times at Richmont High ) as one of Fosters morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky, braces-wearing Laura Dern as an obnoxious party crasher. Achingly authentic, engrossing and deeply moving (Curries grim ultimate fate is very heart-breaking),  Foxes  is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movies made about early 80s adolescence.#1
5989_7#The film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named Gabe, who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon Gabe meets up with the Dead End Kids. The Kids in this film are little punks, but they are much less antisocial than theyd been in other previous films and down deep, they are well-meaning punks. However, in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat--after all, hed been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed. So, when Gabe is about ready to be sent back to  The Big House , its up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks. The  Dead End Kids  appeared in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good (particularly ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES). However, after the boys contracts expired, they went on to Monogram Studios and the films, to put it charitably, were very weak and formulaic--with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed  The Bowery Boys . Because ANGELS WASH THEIR FACES had the excellent writing and production values AND Hall and Gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera, its a pretty good film--and almost earns a score of 7 (its REAL close). In fact, while this isnt a great film aesthetically, its sure a lot of fun to watch, so I will give it a 7! Sure, it was a tad hokey-particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and Reagan ignores the Bill of Rights--but it was also quite entertaining. The Dead End Kids are doing their best performances and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided excellent support. Sure, this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming--so if you can suspend disbelief, it works well.#1
4079_4#I bought a DVD of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The movie was shot entirely on video, so it has the look of a PBS special about it. The special effects are phoney looking, but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat. There is a particularly effective scare involving a Virgin Mary statue. HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the  plot  scenes are long and very boring, and I will tell you I have no clue what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, please make sure you pay less than $5.#0
9689_9#So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh? Well, think again. Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments.The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey.It is journey worth experiencing. Dont miss it! It is available on home video.#1
731_9#This movie is SOOOO funny  The acting is WONDERFUL, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his/her school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, You will love this film. This movie is a tad bit  grease esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung are likable; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through. This musical ranks number two in musicals to me (second next to the blues brothers). But please, do not think of it as a musical per say; seeing as how the songs are so likable, it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place. I think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance. You will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; needless to say, you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film. Highly recommended for both the family (since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience.#1
3222_7#The first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts the -thematic- conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between Todd and his bio-engineered replacement. Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways. Not a great film, but one worth seeing.#1
7891_8#Now all the kids and teenagers of Springwood, Ohio are all dead expect for one teenager (Shon Greenblatt) is still alive. Freddy (Robert Englund) is letting him go and the teenager doesnt have much of a memory, when hes arriving in a new town. When a tough female psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break though the new patient. Shes finds out, where hes from. She brings him along to Springwood to spark some memories but three teens (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan), who unexpected came for the ride. Once they arrived in Springwood, the psychologist has some memory that she did lived in that town before as a child. While Freddy knows the true secret of her true identity. DVD has an strong anamorphic widescreen (1.851) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the original theatrical trailer, Jump to a Nightmare opinion and Cast & Crew information. The  Elm Street  Series Box Set, the eighth disc has interviews with the the cast & crew of this sixth film. The sixth film is also in 3-D for the film climax but you could watch it at 2-D also. This is the last of the  Elm Street  films until Wes Craven resurrected Freddy into a different, darker style in  New Nightmare  and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror film  Freddy Vs Jason . Watch for Robert Shaye (Co-Owner and Co-CEO of  New Line Cinema ), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in amusing cameos. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenters In the Mouth of Madness). From a story by the director. (    ½/     ).#1
9780_2#Good lord, whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive. Im sorry, but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie, he must be watching something else, or have never seen a movie before 9 out of ten stars? Hes saying what, this is as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Unintentionally funny, massively unbelievable characters, absurd situations, looks like it was shot in Griffith Park (which works out pretty well--MASH was shot in Griffith Park), crappy script, just about everything that could possibly be wrong with a movie all rolled into one package. Should be required viewing for all prospective film makers as an example of how a movie could be horribly wrong. It reminds me of something a USC student may make for a film class.  Give this one a pass unless you do drugs and are into high camp.#0
1093_2#Kitten Natividad, of Russ Meyer film fame, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?) that is supposed to have healing powers. After going down on some of this fruit (which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks) Chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super-hero, specifically, The Double D Avenger. Note that shes also wearing a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, that all sounds pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because shes taking away their business so some of the strippers (including Haji, also of Russ Meyer film fame) go after her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights back in the guise of the Double D Avenger. Watch her do a  Wonder Woman  type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow. With the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70s  live action  kids show with adult content, although while this is unrated it could probably get away with PG-13 at the worst. And its probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered. This makes Doris Wishmans Chesty Morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison. Special appearance by Forest J. Ackerman but so what. Very stupid, and Im never buying another film with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.#0
5192_3#It doesnt take long to see why Code Name Diamond Head didnt make it onto the network schedules. The TV pilot movie doesnt get past the credits before its obvious just how bad its going to be. Maybe I missed something, because the plot didnt make a whole lot of sense. Based on what I got out of the muddled mess, a terrorist or thief or something named  Tree  (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. The worlds dullest secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is out to stop him. There might have been more, but trust me  it really doesnt matter anyway. Im quickly discovering that these Gawd awful 70s made-for-TV movies make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and the Bots. So while I may only give the movie a 3/10, I rate Episode 608 a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.#0
3303_10#Pakeezah is in my mind the greatest achievement of Indian cinema. The film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking. The music, the songs, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography, in fact every creative element is worthy of superlatives.#1
5558_7#This story is a familiar one in the long-running Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be evicted if they dont catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed buddy ( Butch? ) living in the house with him, so this really upsets  Mammy Two Shoes  who cant believe that they have a mouse despite TWO cats in the house. Even though its familiar territory I still enjoyed this because the cartoon had enough original sight gags to make entertaining. You not only had the cats competing against each but Jerry in the equation as well, so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you are a Tom & Jerry fan.#1
6547_2#Well, you might not actually SEE any women in love in this movie, but youll certainly hear women TALKING about love, and men talking about love, and women talking about men, and men talking about women, and men talking about men, and everyone talking about death, and talking, and talking, until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all, like paint your bedroom or water your plants.

Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads, out of 10.#0
9415_4#Heavily re-edited and often confusing, the original screen version of Man On Fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years havent made it any better. This is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer, with Scott Glenns bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12-year-old charge, the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - have all done better, the action is sluggish and sparse and only John Scotts exceptionally fine score (part of which turned up in the last reel of Die Hard) makes a positive impression. One case where the remake (made by Tony Scott, the original choice of director for this version) is an improvement.#0
2808_10#This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early 90s -was- sad. But its real message is one of love and perseverance. When  Silverlake Life  was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.#1
8021_7#The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing, with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright (yet volatile) lights of Broadway filled with typically naïve optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (leader of the group and author of the show) blows his top; so, the others all go their separate ways so that he wont have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her fathers diner (the old man, then, has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs!). We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as an overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a confidence trickster), Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by Kermits, sporting fake moustache, as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (in possibly the films funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig!). The other Muppets more or less go through their typical paces, with (regrettably) less space given to Gonzo this time around; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me, the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermits romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny. What disappoints, however, is the climactic show itself (after a fairly redundant midsection wherein Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue) which, rather than the expected splashy routines, procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!#1
8995_3#I missed the beginning but I did see most of it. A friend got it on DVD in the cheap room at FYE. What a disappointment. Most of the actors went on to better things, and its lucky this bomb didnt hold them back.#0
5745_8#Dominick (Nicky) Luciano wears a Hulk T-shirt and trudges off everyday to perform his duties as a garbage man. He uses his physical power in picking up others trash and hauling it to the town dump. He reads comic-book hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling, Going to WrestleMania with his twin brother Eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition. He talks kindly with the many people he comes in contact with during his day. He reads comic books, which he finds in the trash, with a young boy who he often passes by while on the garbage route. Unfortunately, Dominick has a diminished ability to use his mind. He has a disability. Dominick and Eugene was released in 1988, the same year as another film, Rainman, which won 5 Academy Awards. While Rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities, it could be argued that Dominick and Eugene holds more valuable lessons for society. Whereas, Rainman demonstrated that mainstream American society might be able to learn from and care for a savant, if the savant is the inheritor of a large estate. Dominick and Eugene show that a person with a disability might be able to care for and help save members of American society. The message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for 1988. Hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities, not as a threat, but as imperative for the strength of society.#1
602_1#Yet another example of the complete waste of UK Lottery money. Just how commercial did this film prove. The Film Council ,who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded, on one of the London Undergrounds disused stations, for allowing this clichéd, dismal specimen to be committed to film, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, most notably Deathline. Amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute. Its a little bit too late then! Surely all those development executives, at the UK Film Council, could have noticed this at the script stage. Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare.#0
12491_8#This movie was very good. If you are one who likes to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was very good although I thought that the actress playing Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines. Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming. It was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen. I give it two thumbs up! I definitely would say that if you havent already seen it then go rent it. If you have seen it and didnt like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal. I also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my schools campus.#1
4871_8#It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of Zavet as well as of many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process. This is not a perfect film either. The principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up. It is yet one of the most catching, amusing, moving films that I have seen lately.#1
11512_1#    WARNING! SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN!          HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS    #0
11810_7#I still liked it though. Warren Beatty is only fair as the comic book hero. What saves this movie is the set, the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script. I really expected something more substantial in the terms of action, or plot but I got very little. The main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time in such an unusual film.  The costumes and makeup were flawless as well. The facial makeup for the villains was great. Beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character. Still, this is a good movie that could have been much much more. It is to me better than Batman, the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time. Of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross.#1
9127_7#Our imp of the perverse did good his first time out, thats for sure. The music is the best you may ever hear by any human, but you already know that, unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness. A poor script that doesnt flesh out much of a story, but at least it has its moments. the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it. He deserved an Oscar for this s  t, even though he was at times an ego driven twit, with his towering bodyguard Chick Huntsbery always in front. A movie that made non-fans fans, Take it or leave it. Prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though. He takes himself way to serious. He is a genius musician, but pleaseee..Just enjoy the ride, my purple maestro..Peace.#1
3278_8#This is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama. It is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Rather than advancing an agenda, the filmmakers just told the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. The sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and amazingly effective.  A great example of how to make a good film on a small budget, without big studios, star actors, big-name directors (this was far better than many of Hitchcocks films), special effects or  clever  plot twists.#1
8926_1#I saw  Myra Breckinridge  when it first came out in 1970. I was a healthy 20-year-old at the time, who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. On top of that, I had read the Gore Vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie at a local drive-in and about half way through I was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe Id die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. It wasnt  smart  or  trendy , it was gross and sloppy. All the actors were tone deaf and the director didnt have the slightest idea what he was doing. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in movie history. As one reviewer here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud, which would never do for the legendary Ms. West. Oh no, the plot is changed so she sexually beats HIM up, very believable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every DAY of her age. I could go on, but why? It was an awful movie. Bluto#0
7725_10#I first saw this movie when it originally came out. I was about 9 yrs. old and found this movie both highly entertaining and very frightening and unlike any other movie I had seen up until that time. Rating 10 out 10 stars#1
5946_4#There is absolutely no plot in this movie no character developmentno climaxnothing. But has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. So there you goas a movie overall is pretty bad, but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie. Do not expect nothing more that just that.Decent acting and a not so bad direction..A couple of cameos from Kimbo and CaranoI was looking to see Carano a little bit more in this movie..she is a good fighter and a really hot girl. White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art..Imagine a film with White and Jaa togetherthat would be awesome#0
8164_1#I saw this movie at an actual movie theater (probably the $2.00 one) with my cousin and uncle. We were around 11 and 12, I guess, and really into scary movies. I remember being so excited to see it because my cool uncle let us pick the movie (and we probably never got to do that again!) and sooo disappointed afterwards  Just boring and not scary. The only redeeming thing I can remember was Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and that wasnt all that great, just someone I recognized. Ive seen bad movies before and this one has always stuck out in my mind as the worst. This was from what I can recall, one of the most boring, non-scary, waste of our collective $6, and a waste of film. I have read some of the reviews that say it is worth a watch and I say,  Too each his own , but I wouldnt even bother. Not even so bad its good.#0
5249_9#The choice to make this SNL skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones. The humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor, and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two. I liked it, but I doubt it will be a smash hit (which is sad, as Tim Meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other SNL alumni tend to)#1
5407_7#I have always enjoyed the Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, all of them are very corny, mediocre in some certain areas and sure, even though theyre aimed at little kids theyre too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement, Hey, lighten up, its a kids movie,  but all that aside, arent they still good pieces of entertainment? In my opinion, they are so and I enjoy them greatly. This one is just as enjoyable as the previous three, and certainly cuter. It has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable, fresh Pokemon Celebi. Its not the best Pokemon movie, but I do enjoy it more than the third installment, even though the third is not bad, and the entire series is just entertaining, harmless, popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more, nothing less. This film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially around the climax/ending, as do all the installments, and the characters, while a bit more lackluster than the previous three, I thought, are still likable and humorous. This films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length adaptions, and it doesnt deserve that.#1
11525_8#This movie is awesome for three main reasons. It is esthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved that. There is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets. A photography which looks very costly (and probably was not) completes the look . I always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits/loners coming together and becoming a family . Sometimes they fall into clichés but this one does not. This group of actors really portrays well flawed, yet extremely likable characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him , the van and the road movie theme, I could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year Little Miss Sunshine) . I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio , very interesting actor, and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by Til Schweiger performance at times . The opening scene, all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny. There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film. I like the end a lot. And of course it is all about the Magician theme . A good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to, to create an illusion. Which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and thats why they call it movie magic.#1
9042_10#I think I read this someplace Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars film) and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie,  Rocket Boys  (I guess) was lacking something. Anyway, they typed in  Rocket Boys  and sure enough what comes back is  October Sky . They were shocked to say the least. The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik. At first Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he warmed up to it after the  movie poster paperback novel  came out and took off.#1
636_10#Why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome  Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is engaging and funny from moment one, original, and well-acted. I wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves! For anyone that loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. There are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characterseven down to facial expressions.#1
7219_1#I still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in Hollywood. The acting and story is simply pathetic & the direction is awful. I dont see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do. I took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I dont know what category it falls into. Please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, even bang your head against walls but dont go for this movie.#0
8427_1#Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation. My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually very funny.#0
5902_4#I went in expecting the movie to be completely dumb. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but poking fun at the nonsense that goes on in singles wards was also amusing. This film will do well among Mormondom, especially in college communities where singles ward exist. However the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor losers who find themselves unmarried. (Only the pretty girls in the Singles Ward get married, the fat, ugly ones dont, but all the ugly men do) Ultimately we realize that the whole film was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com#0
781_1#This show was absolutely terrible. For one George isnt funny, and his kids are snobby little brats. He also treats his mother with no respect. As a Hispanic, I am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed. In my opinion, they already did.#0
9809_2#Some wonder why there werent anymore Mrs. Murphy movies after this one. Will its because this movie totally blew snot. Disney was not the right studio to run this film. MAYBE Touchstone (well, theyre owned by Disney, but itd be more adult). The film is too kid-ish, as the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters dont even act the way they do in the books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? Hes a girl in the frigging books! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of Don Bluths artwork would suit a better Mrs. Murphy film. Overall, I give this a 2, because at least Disney made a film from an under-appreciated book series. But, I wish they did better. Either way, I still have my books to entertain me.#0
3638_1#The film portrays Frances unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in Western (Francophone) Africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman, France (herein symbolically representing her nation). It is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young womans desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and a nations desire to reach out to the other it once owned and moulded. This is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities. The characters all play a symbolic, albeit a limited and unconvincing role. France, meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a child-in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is just forgettable. The black Africans are, to say the least, offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the directors poor handling of her material. They are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe-like France wonders seeking a world she never knew, and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon.#0
506_7#A strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for  Enterprise,  the  prequel  to the original  Star Trek  series. It stumbles a few times into  Trek  convention and cliché--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style, and I can already foresee snickering references to Tpol as  Seven of Vulcan --but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well-drawn, and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful, in different ways, than those of earlier (later?) series. Scott Bakula hits the right note as a captain with Kirks brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players. The writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in  Star Trek The Next Generation,   Deep Space 9  and  Voyager  Instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift, its starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later--which I hope happens, because after about a half-dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.#1
10581_10#An opium den, a dirty little boy (actually a midget), prostitutes galore, a violent fracas in a dive, a motel for sexual shenanigans, scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot, a boozer falling down the stairs, a racially mixed clientèle in a bar with Asians, Africans, and Anglos treated equally, does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall? Wrong. These are all scenes from a 1933 musical. Though not nearly as socially conscious as  Gold Diggers of 1933,   Footlight Parade  stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen.#1
9636_7#A lonely depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (the gorgeous Stephane Rideau). Quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie. On one hand, I was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys. On the other I was getting annoyed--the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason. Its very confusing and pointless.  #1
6948_4#An interesting idea (four African American women crushed under societys boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks) is ruined by F. Gary Grays horribly slow direction and an excruciating script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unintentionally funny moments. Instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy. Its melodrama at its worst. Gray has his actors linger over every tired line and John Carters lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers bemused faces. And bemused they are although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress shes an excellent rapper), they need a surer hand than Grays to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Steer clear.#0
3763_3#A group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossils.They stumble on a Bigfoot burial ground eventually (the didnt notice it in the dark), The scenes of the CGI Bigfoot are horrid, but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate. I used to think that there just might be a good Bigfoot movie to be made. But now after so many sad sad movies about the legend, Im having serious doubts. To pour salt in the wound of watching this film, the ONE good-looking girl just doesnt get naked once. And while this one MAY be better than  Boggy Creek 2  (no mean feat there), its still sad that the best non-documentary film on Bigfoot remains  Harry and the Henriksons   My Grade D#0
8650_10#Kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights. Ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post. Kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer. Great performances all around by the leads with Pitt in particular being exceptional. Check it out #1
677_1#I shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing, preachy cinematic trash. Larded with enough Indian-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new-age shop, Starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather-wearing crystal-fondling idiot. Sure, the clunky script helps to obscure the films trite plot and staggering pace, but thats just the tip of this melting movie iceberg. Everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science.#0

5928_4#I just dont get some of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that theres anything so ugly it would make you insane. Someone here made the remark that maybe its the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. I also dont quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why doesnt the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be? Theres one part I do like, when Kolos is speaking through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience. Overall, I love TOS and even at its lamest, Ill always tune in. This episode though - mmm, I wouldnt purchase it except for a used copy under $3.#0
2820_4#I dont know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he shouldnt have bothered. As another commenter mentioned, there isnt really enough horror or erotica to bring in fans of either genre. The plot is incoherent, the Sade sequences are gratuitous, and most of the acting is so-so. Englund was doing his best with weak material, and Zoe Trilling has a really great bottom, but neither is enough to carry this film. This ones a tape-over. Grade F#0
1534_1#From the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes Keanu  Im so wooden I could be a Plank me  Reeves look like an Oscar winner this film bites (pun not intended). The best thing about it is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment (which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and twist). Wish Id spent the £3.99 it cost me on something else, like erm. Natural Born Killers Directors Cut. If you do buy this, youre really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague. If youre looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead. However if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, RomasantaThe werewolf Hunt.#0
11858_2#Im a fan of Matthew Modine, but this film--which I stumbled upon on cable--is absolutely witless. I see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same, so there was no one around to check her worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters. The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all this acting talent. Given how expensive it is to film in New York these days, I have to wonder how this got made in the first place. And if youre wondering why I watched it at all, it came on after a film that I like on cable and I left it on while I worked at the computer. Its not a very demanding picture!#0
5627_4#As I watch this film, it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes Black men. The film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible Black man in it is (save for an heroic moment). For much of the film, the other Black men (and dark-skinned Black women) in the film are way in the background, barely visible. Vanessa Williams character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some fairly visible and three-dimensional support characters who are light-skinned, and some White characters of some warmth and dignity. But 99% of the Black males in this film are nothing but invisible men. Voiceless shadows in the background, of no consequence. Such a horrible flaw, but anything but unusual in the mainstream media.#0
9237_4#Stalker is right! Girl sees guy, girl wants guy, girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him, girl wont leave him alone, girl pretends to be a patient, girl cant stop talking about him, girl pretends to love another guy (or two), he doesnt pay attention to her because shes annoying, girl STILL wont leave him alone. Played right, Drakes character could have been charming but shes completely, wholly, unrelenting in her pursuit of Cary Grants character, her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull, and sadly, Drakes attempt at playing,  charmingly screwball  comes off as,  disturbingly demented.  Grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for Cary but its as close to a phoned-in performance as Ive ever seen from him. The direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim. Screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt, it just stinks. Worse still, Drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of Valium and a restraining order. She ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic.#0
558_3#Its been about 14 years since Sharon Stone awarded viewers a leg-crossing that twisted many peoples minds. And now, God knows why, shes in the game again.  Basic Instinct 2  is the sequel to the smash-hit erotica  Basic Instinct  featuring a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original might not even get close to this one, since  Instinct 2  is painful film-making, as the mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones assassinates the legacy of the first film.  Basic Instinct 2  never sounded like a good movie, and, indeed, it isnt. Some films should never get out of paper, and that is the feeling you get after watching this. Now, it is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg dropped out, and why Sharon Stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this-----3/10#0
9207_10#Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971. Filmed almost entirely in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family, but also a relationship between a brother and a sister, as well as drugs and the hippie movement, which made many people think that it involved the ISKON - the movement for Krishna consciousness. As years pass, the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to Nepal. Here, Prashant, the brother not only finds love, but he also finds his sister, Janice. But he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past. With help of Shanti, his love, the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles, including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him This is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself, Dev Anand and also stars Zeenat Aman (her first movie), Mumtaz, Rajendranath, Prem Chopra, Jnr Mehmood, A.K. Hangal and Achala Sachdev. The music is superbly provided by the late R.D. Burman, whose last score was  1942 - A Love Story.  During the filming, Dev Anand asked Panchamda (R.D. Burman) to compose something special for this film. Days later Panchamda came back with the composition of  Dum Maro Dum.  The song was an instant hit.#1
8961_9#Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenoms we see today (back in the 70s - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). It made Novak a huge star, put a nice item on Jack Lemons resume, cast new light on Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious  old bats , in film and television). I will always watch this movie (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90s) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. It has style, substance, a great cast, and terrific production values. And like Adams Rib, it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time, are radical even now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful), and so always seems ahead of the times.#1
7394_9#This Chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture I dont belong and are far from. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps one to relate to each character, and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things. Get it. You wont be disappointed.#1
5684_1#badly directed garbage. a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest  if you are the sort of person who likes that  see a shrink. even if you are that person it doesnt make this a good film, the acting is really poor, the story full of plot holes, the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one. I can see why people dislike uwe boll .. we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them, which is really sad! A complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates. Horror films can be full of desolation, they can be miniature works of art, they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on  SEED is just really really poor.#0
9993_4#Yeti Curse of the Snow Demon starts aboard a plane full of American high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in Japan, unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the Himalayas. Unlucky really. With some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes. However just when they think their luck couldnt get any worse they soon discover that a huge, hairy Yeti type Abominable Snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all. Trapped, cold, starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time? Yeti Curse of the Snow Demon is another terrible Sc-Fi Channel Creature Feature if I am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isnt too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if its not very good.#0
6735_4#The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced. It did not fall flat. The next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylors husband. The actor helping to critique Messings potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd-yet-winning quality to the proceedings. Okay, thats about it on the positive side. If I tried to analyze this one any further, Id obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved. Its harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and less obnoxious (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but youre much better off watching  My Best Friends Wedding  again.#0
9782_4#This film had such promise  What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose its speed due to bad dialoge, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners. Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort.#0
8632_4#I am a huge Charlton Heston fan. He is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but what was he thinking when he made this movie. Normally if he made a bad movie I could blame it on the screenwriter or director, but in this case its all him. The suckiness of this movie is all his fault. It proves that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and Ill never get that time back. This is by far THE WORST Heston movie that Ive ever seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan maybe youll find this movie entertaining, but if youre not dont waste your time, youll regret it in the long run.#0
4448_4#What a powerful start to a film when Julia Roberts character is punched in the face by her abusive and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as Farrah Fawcetts The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was mis-lead. This film was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for, and felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with Roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in Iowa. Her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia getting a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity.there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film I did not care all that much. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re-arranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen. This was I assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience. But I did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as I have said cheated the audience. If it had stayed the course I might have felt for her and her situation. Of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol Ms Roberts. If only the real world was anything close to this.See the Burning Bed and you understand what a film is suppose to be like on the subject of domestic abuse.#0

10750_3#After some internet surfing, I found the  Homefront  series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program  Nightline , complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990s. Even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine. Personally, I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no, the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.#0
5639_1#I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews, but I guess the critics were just sucking up to Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It is definitely the slowest movie I have ever seen with numerous pointless, ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides Defoe who was decent, the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie, Defoes wife Giada included, was ridiculously awful (how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me). This movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie. Sorry for being so harsh, but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema, but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers time.#0
11759_10#The Best of Times is one of the great sleepers of all time. The setup does not tax your patience, the development is steady, the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established, the gags and bits all work and all are funny. There is lots of sentimentality. Kurt Russell playing Reno Hightower puts in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams playing Jack Dundee is sure-footed as ever. The cast also includes many great supporters. Jacks wife is played by Jack Palances daughter, who is lovely, as is Renos wife, who is a great comedian. I cant tell you how many times Ive watched this movie, how many times I have enjoyed it and how often I wish that more people could see it.#1
4599_10#This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and in an interview, Jackie said it was his favorite as well. It contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well. This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used parts in Rapid Fire, and was also lifted in Tango and Cash, which used some of the opening scenes. All in all, another Chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies. By the end of this movie, you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen. So many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore - Jackie had to take responsibility himself. There are no gimmicks, wires or stand-ins - it is all true-life action that is a treat to watch. It is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now. If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or action in general, give yourself a treat and watch this movie. It is truly sensational.#1
6408_10#A Classic Hollywood Biopic is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro both give spectacularly heartfelt performances in the two leads roles, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent, with standout performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport.  Us this a predictable Hollywood film? You bet. So, Mike Leigh addicts should subtract a star, but everyone else should enjoy mightily.#1
4219_4#This is an amateur movie shot on video, not an  electrifying drama  as the DVD liner notes falsely boast. I have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. The bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could have been made using a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. The editing is extremely rough. The final edit was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, instead of with a proper editor. Perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English, e.g.,  Where you go now?  To say the production quality is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If youre not scared away yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.#0
9335_1#The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written, and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A failing couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong, self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the impotent partner for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed, not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A serious waste of time.#0
6890_8#This was one of the highlights of STTNGs semi-forgettable second season, before they grew up or grew into their own in the third season and beyond.

Still one of my favorite episodes. It would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is#1

The chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Loosely based on Rudyard Kiplings poem. A must see by anyone who enjoys this type of movie.#1
7343_2#Ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? Or any taiwanese movie? Propably for a reason. This one was a really boring one, even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels. Pretty much nothing good about this movie; a single character that wasnt completely bland and a few OK black magic spells, like the eel one. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect didnt work at all, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (not that scary really). This is the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen.#0
2648_8#Really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace (via drug addiction) and later redemption. One brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man-child. The other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his familys expectations for both children. Not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be, and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about. Id recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love.#1
1611_10#The bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion! These characteristics of idealistic imagery which  Moonstruck  possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood. Let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are  yesteryear .  Moonstruck  is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City. New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers, this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes. Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made. These generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! For this Italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! The kindred spirits with everyone in  Moonstruck  seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties. One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie. In  Moonstruck , however, I think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation. All of the characters in  Moonstruck  are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity. The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational. All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody elses basic nature is really like  For this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so). The fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives. Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on ones resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore. Thus signifying everything  The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest, get angry; Be honest, get confrontational; Be honest, get distorted and emphatic; Most importantly; Be honest, and fall in love  This is Chers best performance ever as an actress  Nicholas Cage, Danny Aiello, and Olympia Dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in  Moonstruck  Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! Director, Norman Jewison (Famous for  Cincinnati Kid ,  Thomas Crowne Affair , and most famous for  In The Heat Of The Night  which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! I am Italian American in descent, (Partially anyways) Cher is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! I guess since non-Italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending  For those of you who didnt like this movie, I just have one thing to say  Snap Out Of It   This movie  Moonstruck  is totally happy go lucky  Totally eighties  and Totally five stars  See it #1

6683_8#Forget depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door, and have a great time with this maniacally funny, totally absurdist, ultra-campy live-action  cartoon . MYSTERY MEN is a send-up of every superhero flick youve ever seen, but its unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied, and well-cast that they are memorable characters in their own right. Dark humor, downright silliness, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. The comedic talents of the actors playing the Mystery Men -- including one Mystery Woman -- are a perfect foil for Wes Studi as what can only be described as a bargain-basement Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarrely charming) villains ever to walk off the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and onto the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer, and say  huh?  more than once. enjoy #1

351_4#1st watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Arne Glimcher) Mystery??/Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates its audience. The movie-going public is not stupid and I hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with. We think that this movie is going to be about something with Connerys conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard, contrived for the audiences sake, run of the mill, lets never get it over with, thriller. We are pulled into every silly switch in character, as they are portrayed to us when its needed in the story, and were ready for this thing to be over way before it ends. Yes there is some good acting here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne, and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long-awaited end.#0
1090_8#One of Cary Grants most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today. Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham. Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.#1
5395_10#I remember watching this film, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next. I was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a school yard. . Two friends are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A  Lets not go to class today.  And Kid A declines, claiming they could miss something really important. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. When he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid wont share, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important, it could help you for a life time.#1
8816_7#Given the nature and origin of the 11 filmakers it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its stance towards America. Probably the most anti segment comes from Ken Loach who is definitely not towing the British New Labour party line. Although those events of a year ago are shocking and painful to most Americans and most spectators who saw them unfold live through CNN etc. the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an American monopoly. Should anybody be surprised that these 3000 deaths are given the same weight elsewhere as the West gives to thousands Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnian, Chilean, Kurdish (need we go on) victims. If this was a wake-up call for the States then it is equally tragic that in the subsequent 12 months the Israel/Palestine impasse is further from a solution while George Bush Jnr. would rather wreak revenge than make the world a safer place. I think many of the contributors wonder where the idealism of the Founding Fathers went, and why America orignally built as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance now sees its self-interest paramount while the Third World wonders where the next drink, meal or bullet is coming from.#1
3117_2#My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan. I like him too, but have generally found that he should  stick to what he does best  and focus on comedic roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored throughout the entire film. The story was predictable. I realize it was inspired by a true story. But, my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story. None of the characters were well developed. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been explored further. More important, though, would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the  boy . Her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into. She obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way. If my husband wasnt such a huge Williams fan, we would have left 20 minutes into it. Too bad I cant get my $20 or 2 hours back.#0
7500_3#Spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors I have ever seen. He is the critics darling because he supposedly makes films with a  message  or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula Hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different. Someone please, please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass to all the Basketball games he wants. So, maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we wont have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore I wont have to see critics (some of them whom I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to an Emperor with no clothes.#0
968_1#An intriguing premise of hand-drawn fantasy come to life in a childs fever dreams. However, I imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than Bernard Rose is at riveting the viewer. The duel between Annas two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest, especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor Ive ever seen. Use only for kindling.#0
4254_9#I really enjoyed this movie. The script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding.It is a down-to-earth movie with characters one cares about. It brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards.#1
532_9#Enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known  death romances  such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur. With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the CGI era. This film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.#1
7718_10#Forbidden Planet rates as landmark in science fiction, carefully staying within  hard  aspects of the genre (science -- not fantasy, ergo nerds will love it) while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary 1950s values. Morbiuss isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into sculpted gardens, a swimming pool, and the ultimate home appliance Robby the Robot.  A housewifes dream!  exclaims the Captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robots abilities to synthesize food and disintegrate waste. Maybe the Krell had teenage daughters too?#1
5548_4#Though the title includes the word  zombies , this film is not what youd expect from a movie made today, though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected. Dean Jagger portrays Armand Louque, an officer in the French Army of World War I, who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons, or  zombies , who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war, though on whose side is not certain. At first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon, but eventually French General Duval (George Cleveland) orders a non military expedition into the ancient Cambodian city of Angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it. Not to be too harsh on the film, it plays out decently within the parameters of its story outline, but if youre thinking  zombies   within the traditional context, youll probably be disappointed. If you want to sample an early treatment of the subject, the aforementioned  White Zombie  with Bela Lugosi is the way to go.#0
7745_1#Where to begin? the special effects should be named special defects, When the director shouted  action  I guess he also indicated to the actors to carry out the worst performance they could think of. Maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single cent out of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make movie. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant but his family did not let him. The only thing that is sure that whoever employs him in the future is because its in love with him (so its objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed its name and deleted all past previous references.#0
3977_2#Identical twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen climbed to fame in sitcoms like  Two of a Kind , I had never seen them in anything before, but I had an idea of what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically the Hunter sisters Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a Summer Intern Program, but not long after starting their jobs they are immediately fired for a series of mishaps. But the man who owns the company they are working in, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them their jobs back, and they they do slowly prove themselves useful assets, and talented (fashion) artists, and help stop a mean man taking over the company. Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can tell that this film was made to go straight to video, the camera-work is completely mismatched, and it doesnt help when you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact the background is the only good thing to watch, the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around, I knew before watching that they werent going to interest me in any way (their not even that pretty), this is awful gush of rubbish film. Pretty poor #0
11429_1#Wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen  This person should never make another movie I cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience.YOu have have wasted every cent. No concept of real life. I have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back. EVER  Everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed  Im embarrassed for them! All of you should be ashamed. If i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years. Please never watch this movie.I have never written a blogg about a film before but The distaste for this film has compelled me to do so.#0
9667_2#This film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The insistent equation of Jews with disease is simply briefly, is an object lesson in itself. You have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this, and I wouldnt recommend trying unless you have a good reason.#0
1146_7#This movie is about a fictional soap opera. It is very fast and funny. To say anything else would ruin the movie. There are several plots and sub plots in the movie. This movie has ensemble cast with todays hottest stars. They all gives over the top performances. This movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera /or prime time soap opera If you watch soap go check this movie its hilarious #1
53_10#Home Room really surprised me. In comparison to other movies that were written regarding Columbine high school this one is the best. Home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town. The movie focus on two opposite characters., Alecia(Busy Phillips) and Deanna(Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting. She seems to show no emotion about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital in order to graduate. Meanwhile the police are investigating Alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not get along at first. Eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends. (very much in the style of the breakfast club). Home Room Beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone.#1
11426_1#Heather Graham couldnt play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do the producers of the movie think they are? the ABSOLUTE WORST, most UNREALISTIC movie ive seen in as long as i can remember. This movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign-up on IMDb and make sure the rating of this  film  drops. WHAT A JOKE! and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick, but im so sick of even thinking about it anymore. bottom line, if youre a smart person youll hate this movie, and if youre not a smart person, then youll love it its as simple as that.#0
9687_3#This is a baffling film.  Greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships.#0
4252_4#   Possible Spoilers    4/10 Movie-Man#0
89_2#Ive seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than  Loves Abiding Joy.  The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Dont watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies #0
11880_10# Scarface  has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.  Scarface  is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland #1
1987_10#That movie was awesome! I cant get over its songs. I think Im a little too old for musicals, but that movie deserves some credit here, guys! My especial favorite was Jack Wild. Me, being a British actor lover, you cant restrain me from all those nice-looking fresh faced, young men. I never knew that when Jack was doing that movie he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven- year old. Hes short, thats what helps. Try posting up your replies, fellow posters, so I can relate to your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think that drone look is really familiar. Any idea where hes starred in before? If so, post it up, Id really like to know.#1
10594_1#I was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film. I didnt enjoy the first one at all, and the last Jean Claude Van Damme film I liked was Blood Sports! After managing to sit through it all? Avoid, avoid, avoid #0
10862_3#I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me. Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can, then I might re-check his old movies and try to find talent in them.#0

7652_3#In 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who performed experiments with orphan children. On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities. When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.

7497_4#After seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out Spike Lee was directing, I was excited to hear about this event. I wasnt alive at the time, I didnt live in New York, so I expected more of a history lesson than anything. What I got was some interesting acting, a lot of sex, and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the Son of Sam. I guess the film wasnt about the Son of Sam, but it was a peek into the summer of 77. Label me disappointed. #0
10045_10#I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasnt THAT bad or else people wouldnt even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do! I guess this film isnt for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.  #1
4892_10#This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I shall never tire of watching many, many times. The casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs heroes, not deviant manikins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a fine job.#1
6320_10#The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it. But this movie caught me off guard. It wasnt what I was expecting at all. Its been a while since Ive seen it but I do remember I could not stop laughing  And it wasnt just the cast that did it for me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you were expecting something to happen it didnt happen. There were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious. The cinematography, along with the set, was absolutely beautiful as well. I really cant say anything bad about this movie! Expcept, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more screen time!#1
10842_4#Noting the cast, I recently watched this movie on TCM, hoping for an under-appreciated gem, as I regard many films from the 30s. This is no gem - not even semi-precious. The anachronistic clothing and 1930s Rolls Royce limo hit you immediately. The casting is strange, also. But mostly, there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices. This film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise, but the components arent mixed according to the right recipe. It simply doesnt come together like it should. And thats a shame. WIth a few rather obvious, but minor alterations, this might have been a very good movie. It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is cast as the Irishman living in England, while Cary Grant is cast as the Frenchman. This movie would have been much better had they reversed roles. That also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been#0
2690_9#La Teta i la Luna (The Breast and the Moon) describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy named Tete who is obsessed with breasts growing up in Catalunya. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Lunas movies (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age. Also being from Catalunya (North-east of Spain) it brought lots of memories to my mind. This movie shows how beautiful Catalunya is, nice people, nice life and specially lots of non-uptight people.#1
12209_7#I was very impressed with this small, independently made picture. The story, about a pair of social outcasts who meet, become friends, and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children, is at times hilarious, at times sad, but always provocative. Music, mostly by underground bands, was used to great effect, as was the experimentation with camera angles, filters, and slow or fast motion techniques. The performances (the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film) are some of the best Ive seen in the last couple of years. If you ever felt like a square peg being forced into a round slot, I really believe youll appreciate  By Hook or By Crook .#1
11389_7# Oxford, Mississippi, at least. Okay, the Paris we get is Paris, Culver City apart from the Establishing library footage of the real McCoy but it IS Paris in spirit than which nothing, nowhere, is better. Okay, Kelly is no Astaire but then who is and Caron is no Hepburn, ditto but Alan Lerner is light years ahead of the vastly overrated Comden and Green who scripted Kellys other big 50s musical Singin In The Rain (a curious replication of lyricists writing screenplays featuring songs by OTHER lyricists and just to balance things the Gershwin numbers are far superior to the Arthur Freed/Nacio Herb Brown numbers so Alan Lerner didnt have to feel too outclassed). The story neednt detain us any more than the anomalies -Kelly hasnt got change of a match and is a painter, i.e. bohemian, yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when Foch invites him to dinner at her hotel; in the well-documented Love Is Here To Stay sequence the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers-by, other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic - this is, after all, a feelgood musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square. As feel good musicals go its definitely in the top 10.#1
12290_10#Hotel Du Nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which Marcel Carne portrayed an entertaining tale of ill-fated love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world.The film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers.Pierre and Renee were mistaken when they believed that suicide would put an end to their misery.Hotel Du Nord has its own inimitable charm as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment.There is an element of togetherness as everyone flocks to Hotel Du Nord to eat,chat etc.Marcel Carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in 30s and 40s as Hotel Du Nord has a certain kind of nostalgic feel.Carne,while recreating the life of Parisian roads was able to create a sort of nostalgia for black and white giving a unique genre of poetic realism to his oeuvre.Hotel Du Nord can be termed as a quintessence of cinematographic populism.The 14th July ball scene on the banks of Saint Martin canal remains a magnificent sequence.The films immense popularity can be judged from the fact that Hotel Du Nord has been declared as a national monument.#1
1142_3#Youve been fouled and beaten up in submission by my harsh statements about  femme fatale  /  guns n gals  movies! Now comes another breed in disappointing rediscoveries ninja movies! Many of these Ive seen before, and let me tell you, they arent all thats cracked up to be! They usually dont stick to the point. This, among all others, suffers from no originality! Whats a ninja got to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And isnt this supposed to be a  martial arts  movie, too? Does plenty of gunfire sound like an incredible action movie to you? Is blood the number one reason to love this to death? Will you waste some of your hard-earned cash over a lady singing in her see-through tank top? The answers to these important questions are found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. For even more nonsense ninja fun, try checking out those Godfrey Ho movies put out by Trans World. You get what you deserve, and thats a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts #0
258_7#Sandwiched in between San Francisco and Captains Courageous two of Spencer Tracys greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people. They Gave Him A Gun stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only film they ever made together and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both. The World War I battle sequences are very well staged by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason Leonard Maltin panned this film, I think its a lot better than he gave it credit.#1
8496_7#Wow, its been years since I last saw this movie. Watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986. Initially I didnt think I would make it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so obnoxious, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to watch him. He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If that wasnt bad enough, once the small American towns finest workers were shown the image only got worse. On the opposite spectrum the Japanese were presented as emotionless, robotic workaholics. The movie wasnt even all that funny, I only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it. And Im glad I continued the watch. Just like boxing, judges are swayed by how you finish the round. This movie went from about a three up to the seven I rated it because of the ending. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious ending and this was just that. It was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory, but what was most special was the marriage between the Japanese customs and values and the American customs and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note.#1
7212_9#I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of Death Trap  in a top 5 list of the best stage-to-movie adaptations ever. Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and  Superman ) play off each other extremely well here. Even Dyan Cannon - who I normally dont care for - is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actress. Anyone who likes black-hearted comedy and suspense in the Hitchcock style of film-making will probably enjoy  Deathtrap  immensely.#1
3554_10#Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra HATED each other while doing this film and in the years following it.Brando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons,but Sinatra (who was already upset over the fact that he was cast as Nathan Detroit,when he wanted the part of Skye Masterson)wanted to be the star singer in the production and didnt want any one to be better than he was.He told Brando to get lost,so to get back at him Marlon kept screwing up the scene in the diner where Sinatra was eating cheesecake so that he would have to keep eating,eating and eating.In the later years,Sinatra gave Brando the nickname  Mumbles  or  Mr.Mumbles  because of the way he talks.#1

1459_10#Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a non-preachy documentary on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS MADE IN CHINA. This film has zero narration and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China who live inside a factory compound. They play with toys, jump rope, and dance. Yet, the majority of their days and nights consist of work, work, and work -- but the footage of their work is illuminating and mesmerizing to watch. The owner of the factory in China is amazingly open, so much so that he hits home the effects of globalization while he  punishes  the workers. Astutely following Mardi Gras beads from China to the Carnival, the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting, compelling footage from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras revelers to each other through pictures. Here, the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never preachy, is not guilt driven, and allows everyones point of view to be present. At the end, we -- the viewers -- make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film, and globalization.#1
1838_10#WAQT is a perfect example of a chicken soup not exactly for your soul. The broth unfortunately has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excess dilution and garnishing that went into its making. To sum up, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional but the final recipe somehow isnt as much appetizing.#1

1067_7#Like a lot of series pilots, Dark Angels opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet. Not that this is unusual in any way, but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more. In todays world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation, the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused, with all guns blazing. In all, I gave the Dark Angel pilot a seven out of ten. It never rises above the level of throwaway television, and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time. But the potential is there, and thats often all that matters where pilots are concerned.#1
8645_1#I just got back from this free screening, and this  Osama Witch Project  is the hands-down worst film Ive seen this year, worse than even  Catwoman  - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction. Around  Tape 4,  I began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.#0
1854_10#Having developed a critical eye for film, and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my breath symbolically held. While I am an unabashed fan of Denzel Washington - both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona; I am an honest enough fan to admit the (very few) times when he hasnt quite hit the mark in a film or two. And I could be wrong about those - after all, I am not an actor. But this was different - Denzel would pour his careers experience into, and guide, a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man - the abuse of a child. As his directorial debut, no less. And develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man. I didnt want to be disappointed. What I did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences, and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief, but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed despite it all. This film did it - and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it. It takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented. It takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you havent experienced it. And if he can further draw an audience in, and cause an audience to emotionally respond, without pity, the filmmaker has done his job. In any film. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. That is what makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all, Antwone Fisher - you have indeed won.#1
11057_3#What about Dahmers childhood?- The double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body? What about  infinity land ? - The game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another, suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger. What about the relationship between his parents, and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father? His feelings of neglect when his brother was born? What about his fascination with insects and animals? How he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home?What about focusing more on his cannibalism? And what about his parents divorce? These are all things that should have been included in the film. Instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down snapshot from a night or two in his life, and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks, to events that werent even particularly relevant to our understanding of Dahmer. Aside from the facts and lack of depth, the film isnt all bad. There is some nice cinematography, and good performances from the two main characters. Id like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge, more energy, and a better reason for making the film in the first place.#0
2587_2#OK so theres nudity, but hey, theres free porn on the internet for whomever likes it. And its just silly how they forced tits into every frame.

4402_8#After seeing all the Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawkers,etc films in the fifties, it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director Ang Lee. The scene of the attack of Lawrence, Kansas is awesome. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as the bad guy. All the time this film makes you feel the horror of war, and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours. Definitely worth seeing.#1
7178_10#PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute film. It is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80s by a group of upper class neighborhood kids. One of the films directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But, this is also much more. This is a look into some moments in time as children grapple with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life --- fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us. As we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little.  #1
1050_4#Nathan Detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in NYC, but the heat is on and he cant find a secure location. He bets chronic gambler Sky Masterson that Sky cant make a prim missionary, Sarah Brown, go out to dinner with him. Sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store  This is one of those expensive fifties MGM musicals in splashy colour, with big sets, loud music, larger-than-life roles and performances to match; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing, which I dont. My main problem with these type of movies is simply the music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway show tunes in swing time with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar arent my cup of tea. This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of Damon Runyon stories), and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak. Blaines two numbers for example are identical, unnecessary, dont advance the plot and grate on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you). There are only two memorable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you might expect) and Sit Down, Youre Rockin The Boat (nicely performed by Kaye) but you have to sit through two hours to get to them. The movies trump card is a young Brando giving a thoughtful, laid-back performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and is evenly matched with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence where the two of them escape to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vowel-murdering of Noo Yawk. Fans of musicals may dig this, but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show.#0
3268_1#Its a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror. Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad.#0
10996_1#The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies Ive ever seen. I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase  guaranteed to offend  written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh. Keep The Underground Comedy Movie underground bury it #0
11215_1#Okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a $60,000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed? Plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldnt you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her  proof . I dont know I was not happy with the ending. This movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy.#0
6781_4#A good cast (with one major exception) pushes its way through Epsteins smart light satire. Mansfield was never better, or funnier, than she is here paired with Walston, whos a veteran whos determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. He and his buddies -- including suave con-artist Grant -- head to San Francisco on leave and start the citys swinginest party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking tours. The only thing about this movie thats not delightful is Suzy Parkers one-note performance as Grants love interest, which takes up too much of the films time and slows down the pace in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; the gimmick is that shes set on making love to every serviceman (to do her duty for the war effort, of course) but hes a married man who, nonetheless, loves his wife. They steal the movie with little trouble from Grant (whos amusing here in the first part of the film, when not paired with his non-actor co-star.#0
9507_3#I always get frustrated by films that were obviously written by one gender. Especially when they obviously dont do enough research to find out when something not only doesnt ring true, but rings blatently false. It was obvious that this film didnt take itself so seriously, and it wasnt hideously bad, but come on!#0
10776_8# Radiofreccia  is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book of Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the movie and writes the music score -of course. In  Radiofreccia  actors are generally not very famous, the only star is Stefano Accorsi -one of the most popular young Italian actors. See in a small role another Italian songwriter -Francesco Guccini, hes the nice communist barman and football trainer #1
3971_1#Give me my money back! Give me my life back! Give me a bit of credit. This movie was vomit worthy. Useless and time consuming. What a waste of energy and totally pointless. Okay I understand the premise and the idea sound but, give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mothers remorse, blamed husband! Cliché yes~! Get a life! Sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I would rather watch eggs cook! No real explanation to why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obvious but Why? Acting deserves a What am I doing here Oscar and the cinematography a Am I just doing this for a Wage? How much did this movie make? Well this silly fool hired a copy. Enough said#0
4636_3#The  Confidential  part was meant to piggy-back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline Congressional investigations of the day. However, despite the A-grade B-movie cast and some good script ideas, the movie plods along for some 73 minutes. Its a cheap-jack production all the way. Whats needed to off-set the poor production values is some imagination, especially from uninspired director Sidney Salkow. A few daylight location shots, for example, would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets. A stylish helmsman like Anthony Mann might have done something with the thick-ear material, but Salkow treats it as just another pay-day exercise. Too bad that Brian Keiths typical low-key style doesnt work here, coming across as merely wooden and lethargic, at the same time cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. goes over the top as a wild-eyed drunk. Clearly, Salkow is no actors director. But, youve got to hand it to that saucy little number Beverly Garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication. Too bad, she wasnt in charge. My advice-- skip it, unless youre into ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait-jacketed 50s fashion.#0
6225_1#I doubt this will ever even be a cult film. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much out of this film and got even less. What could have been clever and moving was campy. It was devoid of the music that made Gram and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era. The characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of Grams and all the versions of his  afterlife adventures  I have heard. Rock and roll is full of tales, good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt. They can be great stories even though exaggerated. However, this movie took a good story and turned into tripe. Stealing any dead body and the ensuing implications should never be a dull tale but they made it dull, somehow. I am tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, head out to the desert and burn them all.#0
5666_10#I loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when I found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasnt worthy of being continued! For years I hung onto my copies of this show, ones that I had taped or had someone tape for me. That is until now. The powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD and I finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set. Which, brings me to this part; the part about that this show is all about. Gary Cole did a great job as the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has just the right amount of charm verses evil to pull it off. The other actors did a super job as well, so I guess you could say, even the casting was a hit with me.#1
2353_10# Pushing Daisies  for sure is one of the best TV shows of its genre in the last 5 years, agree you with that or not. Bryan Fuller, the creator, has an amazing creative mind. Hes the mind behind other great TV Shows as  Dead Like Me  (2003),  Wonderfalls  (2004), and the other one not as great as these ones, but also interesting,  Heroes  (2006). Its a mix of the marvelous worlds Brian Fuller created in previous TV shows, mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings, something that a fairytale always is. So, being a kind of fairytale, you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations, or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told. Truth be told TV has never been so daring in a TV Show as with this amazing one.  Pushing Daisies  was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful. Its true that TV doesnt respect great TV shows as those ones Bryan Fuller created - except  Heroes  thats still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones.#1
2999_7#There were times when this movie seemed to get a whole lot more complicated than it needed to be, but I guess thats part of its charm. Detective Philo Vances powers of observation seem greater than all the Oriental sleuths of the era combined when it comes down to that final evaluation of how the murders were committed. The dropping of the dagger into the Chinese vase was the kicker for me; I mean, couldnt somebody have just dropped it?  Once the killers identity is revealed, it doesnt seem like such a big surprise, but up till then its really anybodys guess. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the film didnt answer the central question posed by the title, and the murder I was really interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonalds dog Ghillie?#1
11390_1#This isnt a movie. It is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair, dead-pan stare, ipod and nervous tic - probably shot it herself in a creative phase. Whats next? Six directors shooting social intercourse at the Wal-Mart snack counter?#0
3748_10#Ive watched it plenty of times and Im planning on buying the full feature. I love all of Jason Steeles comedy. Its very different and unique and is very enjoyable. I love indie films and this one is just great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking Spatula named Edward. The order of the events are a bit jumbled, making this film very interesting to watch. At first you see Edward fighting the spoons, but then the focus changes to earlier in his life. This is a silly movie, but of course, its still great. I highly recommend that you watch this film at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. Its very funny. The humour may not match everybodys taste but watch anyway. Itll only take 16 minutes of your time, and its free. GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS!#1
852_1#I am going to keep this short.This  adaption  of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more.Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250. Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King isnot a good writer should stick to reviewing  masterpieces  like  eyes wide shut .#0
8327_1#OK. So its a low-budget  film  (I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). The acting is universally horrid, the makeup is laughable (the blood looks like it came from Sherwin-Williams and Ive seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting generally looks like they used someones borrowed Toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors. And dont worry -- no spoilers here, cause theres absolutely nothing to spoil.#0
10864_8#It might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films, but I think its the best way to give an approximation of the place Election occupies in the gangster genre arena. It works somewhere in between The Godfather and Kinji Fukasakus yakuza opus The Yakuza Papers (AKA Battles Without Honour and Humanity), in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic, dark and gritty. But its also a Johnnie To film, and as such it carries the distinct touch of the Hong Kong auteur. If youre familiar with Tos style, then you should know what to expect. The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. The cinematography is great, slick and dark in equal measures, utilizing dark hues (brown, dark green and orange) while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it. In the end, Election occupies a peculiar place. Its not exactly a character study and its not an action-oriented gangster film. It explores a situation (the election and its aftermath), but does so in style, and is both realistic and romanticized (the Triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental Godfather).#1
6028_9#This is the film in Antonionis middle period that most critics dismiss quickly, as a flawed look at 60s American youth culture/politics. For what its worth, I found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like LAVVENTURA, perhaps because he shows more emotion & empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a frame for Antonionis brilliant observations of, and critique on American consumerist culture, student life, the counter-culture, and the whole anti-establishment, anti-war backlash that was so prominent then.  Contrary to popular opinion, this is quite an achievement in cinema, and one I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off- beat. Well worth seeking out, and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a DVD restoration/release.#1
6166_10#The Bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow-haze of socio-introspection emerged, inspiring such famed derivatives as Cop Land, The Departed, The Godfather 3, and most recently of course, The Wire. The last word should go to one of The Bills most famous fans, Nelson Mandela  it is no exaggeration to say that I would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of incarceration on Robben Island if it wasnt for the heart-warming, casual buffoonery of Reg Hollis.  #1
5687_1#While not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptations, this hunk of crud doesnt fare much better. #0
7583_7#The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the directors chair, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero. Significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the finest in the Hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits. Complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy the fans.#1
2971_3#Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, is, in a word, stale.  But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots, a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, lacking the punch and bite that the Animated Series had in its prime.#0
9642_4#I couldnt believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of peoples mouths, and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot. And we get titty shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (sort of) and Loren Crabtree to boot. 4 out of 10#0
10539_4#People tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror/thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer (whose name escapes me at the moment). Whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair, he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never-ending murder spree. Its not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on, by the way. Other low-budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise, like  House 3 ,  Shocker  and  Ghost in the Machine . Anyway,  The First Power  (a.k.a  Pentagram ) isnt a completely terrible effort, but the script overly reverts to clichés and lacks genuine thrills. The film starts off as an okay, albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop-hero Lou Diamond Philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims. He receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium, played by the gorgeous and underrated Tracy Griffith. She leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him, as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe! Thanks to Tess helpful hints, Detective Logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty, but Patrick Channing made a pact with Satan Himself and returns to the rotten streets of California to do some more killing.  The First Power  gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit. Instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world (thats what I would do in his position), Channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper. He annoyingly calls him  Buddy-Boy  all the time and possesses the bodies of Logans friends and colleagues in order to trick him. Even though never really boring or poorly realized, its a very weak film to endure, mostly because you constantly get the feeling of déjà-vu. Writer/director Robert Resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché (the killer got sexually abused as a child) and even the players lines can easily be predicted. As soon as Griffith explains shes able to predict the future, you just know that, somewhere at some point in the film, shes going to say the ridiculously overused line  I tell people who to live their lives, but my own life is a mess . Yawn. Lou Diamond Philips performance is adequate enough, but its rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of  La Bamba  and  Stand And Deliver  serious as a tough copper. There also are decent supportive roles for Mykelti Williamson ( Forrest Gump ), Carmen Argenziano ( When a Stranger Calls ) and B-movie horror legend David Gale ( Re-Animator ) appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film.#0
5263_8#Netflix should mention this short feature on the info for Silk Stockings. Superior in every way to that over-produced fluff. This had much better Cole Porter songs and lots more energy. Silk Stockings turned out to be a big disappointment. Fred was getting too old for this sort of thing, though the dances and Cyd are lovely. I will be on the watch for the Garbo--Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. Was Peter Lorre ill during the making of Silk Stockings--he seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with less lines? Very glad that I ran across Paree--Paree by pure accident. Made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a simple  song and dance man is pure joy.#1
11440_10#I went and saw Rivers and Tides again today. Its the second time in two days and yes, I do see movies I like as many times as is necessary. Yesterday I was struck by the brilliance of the images and Goldsworthys works. This morning when I threw the coins I received 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence the title. I received the 5th line changing which moved to 7 The Army. To Blake Art was a War. Anyway, I knew I had to see the film again. #1
2127_3#Why? Because for one reason, there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than Ann Margret singing  Bye Bye Birdie  at the opening. She reprises it again at the ending, too (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Rent it and see. Even if thats all of it that you watch. Youll agree, Im sure. Everything about the original was so excellent it just didnt need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their all, but its like trying to improve on  Casablanca  -- it just cant be done! Its even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake, and it just falls short, through no fault of the actors.#0
376_10#Spielbergs first dramatic film is no let-down. Its a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all movies that have the African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an African-American director. Now, I heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well, and all I can say is I hope its about as good as this one is, because this one is a film that shouldnt be missed.#1
12011_4#John Pressman (Micheal I shoulda called Ditech Lerner) works at a doctors office as an orderly. His mother (Zelda Poltergeist Rubenstein) hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him. But this turns out to be a movie within a movie, but the lines soon blur as John goes a movie theater to kill. Prompting a guy whos watching the movie to do the same. Lerner is suitably over the top in this, but Zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again. That gets annoying fast. But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie.As a horror film this one fails, its too busy trying to be clever, trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of slasher An art-house one. My Grade D+#0
3901_2#The script is nice.Though the casting is absolutely non-watchable.No style. the costumes do not look like some from the High Highbury society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Ms. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Ms. Paltrow, though in Ms. Paltrows acting lies the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam undoubtedly is the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like Mr. Knightley in the TV-version. P.S.The spectator cannot see at all Mr. Elton-Ms. Smith relationships development as it was in the motion version, so one cannot understand where was all Emmas trying of make a Elton-Smith match (besides of the portrait).#0
1440_7#I liked the quiet noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the movie; she was an earnest and appealing character. The film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didnt want him meddling in. Nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard. Here the story became implausible. Something that I dont understand why did the cop and Vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge?#1
9282_8#In Iran, women are not admitted to soccer games. Officially its because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it is about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings. Despite the insane situation, this is a film with lots of humor. Its also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression. Youll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs. Good job by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.#1
3883_10#Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I sure am glad that I have now! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then Eddie. I could not stop laughing for the entire show. If you like to laugh you HAVE to see this special!#1
3770_10#When will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world? If you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching  Bill and Teds bogus journey.  This is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch, Keanu and Alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from  Bill and Teds excellent adventure  with even more style then they had in 1st movie. Its not rocket science but its great for a laugh, the characters being extremely like-able and the story-line being so radical you have to laugh. Dont expect deep-and-meaningfulls just expect pure fun #1
4363_8#Its a little disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movieplayed by Gig Young. But this film is where Gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name. If youre a Stanwyck fan, this is a no miss.#1
4835_1#Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan. He also happens to be a highly-qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul, operating on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards. He is then finally promoted to sergeant, but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career, so he quits from the Army altogether. One year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.#0
1421_9#This documentary makes you travel all around the globe. It contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness. It shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be. The polar bears future is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it. After all, its bleak future is closely linked with the consequences of global warming. This documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue. It can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains descriptive. Scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of Al Gores documentary  An inconvenient truth  but franklywhat a description  A question may then arise Isnt it worth preserving our worlds beauty? Because this documentary proves that in 2007 such a beauty still exists despite the different pollutions. By living in towns and cities we tend to forget that we are part and parcel of this nature. All things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called  EARTH .#1
4153_1#I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were lackluster, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all, it was on the back of the box. I dont think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time, and Im a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies  ;) Even that couldnt save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or lay in this case) in front of a camera. All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $3. Just my $0.02.#0
2466_9#I have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when I saw this film. This film restores the power and art to Hamlet that it was always meant to have. Even those oh-so famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh the brightest star. It is his charisma, power and command of the role that defines the movie. Making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length. Where one would expect the dark, gloomy cliched castle, we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The only gloom comes from Hamlet himself, as it should. Well worth your time, all four hours of it.#1
1177_1#This Movie is complete crap! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, it is rambling and incoherent. I pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70s sleaze cinema from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like being shocked, but I need a coherent story. However if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you. The saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang. I mean its just plain hard to sit through, not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly. Please, I know the cover is interesting (what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a womans bare ass)but dont waste your time or money as you wont get either back.#0
204_10#First off, I dislike almost all Neil Simon movies. But there is something about this that is unique, that draws me in, and I would say it is among the most entertaining comedies I have seen. The second time I watched it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers?  Very ethnic in flavor, and over the top, you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off. For me, the pleasure lingers.#1
4006_4#For those of you whove never heard of it (or seen it on A&E), Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about an overweight, chain-smoking, foulmouthed psychologist named Fitz who helps the Manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals. Its considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of England (and thats saying something), and was tremendously successful in England and around the world back in 1993. So, all in all, I was a little disappointed. Its recommended viewing, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. Still, if theres new series to come after this, it would all have been for the good Im convinced that McGovern can still write great stuff, and maybe now that hes got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people.#0
11135_2#What more can I say? The acting was, almost without exception, amateurish. The directing and continuity were pitiful. The sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious. One of the features on the DVD was labeled  Gag Reel  but that could have been a description of a viewers reaction to most of the movie. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit (per the making of feature on the DVD) and rather looked it. The mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store. The cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game.#0
5489_10#Very good point there   only an elite few (the upper classes) would both have access to the internet AND be able to communicate on an exclusively English speaking site such as the IMDb  Some might think Internet Is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake You are probably right.. Even If there Is Internet cafes in Venezuela most Chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. Screw you faschist upper class rich right wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors .. Probably this is your first time using Internet ;)..#1
7286_2# The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.#0
8805_3#The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable. Quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time.  Pulp Fiction  was robbed for  Best Picture.  This is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is  slow.  #0
3915_2#This movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply confusing. The acting cant possibly overcome the script which removes the characters motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. DONT SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.#0

8902_3#Its not often I feel compelled to give negative criticism of a film; after all I often feel the maxim,  if you dont have anything good to say dont say it at all,  would be apt advice for the many naysayers we listen to everyday who nitpick at things we like. If its all the same to you the reader though I feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of Christopher Walken in a returning role as Gabriel this movie is pathetically HORRID. I say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of Walkens deadpan delivery and style or liked the original  Prophecy  that you will be sorely dissapointed. If you buy it, return it. If you rent it, make sure its only ninety-nine cents. Bottom line - its an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place. The original told the right story, answered the questions that should have been, and left alone the ones you were meant to ponder afterwards. There are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first - the priest who lost his faith, the little girl who kept the  big secret , the teacher who protected her children - even Lucifer himself was more interesting BY himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together. I feel sorry for anybody who sees this film and not the first because theyll probably never want to watch the original and thats a real tragedy.#0
4461_8#I really liked this movie. I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best. I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth renting.#1
1382_8#Not everything is said in this excellent first feature from Céline Sciamma. The friendship, the  wanting to fit in , the first sexual feelings All this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenes. Bon cinéma  #1
11309_3#Bad plot (though good for a B-movie), good fast-paced fight scenes, at most a 5 out of 10. But something has always bothered me about this film how come Mariska Hargitay never speaks? In the TV version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. Yet in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all. This bothers me because it not only takes out a female (though cliched) point-of-view to the film, it also makes the final shot seem creepy. This film would have been better had they kept her scenes in, because in those scenes at least she has a personality, one that undercuts whatever Speakman says.#0
1318_8#I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra as it has received a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. This is an old movie and the animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. There are few if any references to specific Japanese culture and great for Anime novices to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra himself is witty and likable. I cannot say how much of this is due to the English dub or the intentions of the maker, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find truly funny. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. I cannot think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. You barely realise that it is happening, but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. You also really feel the characters went on a journey and theyre lives were changed by the whole experience. Check out if you can.#1
5952_9#This movie is humorous, charming, and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so I simply accept it as is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, performs quite well as the blacksmith, Hank Martin, who by accident is transported back to another age, the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking as Alisande, or Sandy, the object of Hanks affections although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. #1
6836_9#Yesterday, I went to the monthly Antique Flea Market that comes to town. I really have no interest in such things, but I went for the fellowship of friends who do have such an interest. Looking over the hundreds of vendor, passing many of them quickly, I spotted someone selling VHS tapes and DVDs. Most of the films he had on DVD were rather recent; the oldest one I noticed was the 1940 Cary Grant-Irene Dunne co-starrer MY FAVORITE WIFE. But the VHS tapes, by their nature, were mostly older films. I couldnt resist buying SOMETHING since they were being sold at 3 tapes for $10.00. What a bargain, as Eddie Murphy used to say. I came across one film that I had heard about for years but had never seen John Cassavettess OPENING NIGHT (1977). Well, I certainly wanted that being a fan of Gena Rowlands, and I had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances. He also had FACES (1968). I had seen this about 20 years ago, a time when I probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly. And I wanted to take advantage of the bargain, so I grabbed that one too. My other choice was CLAIRES KNEE (1970).  Seek out OPENING NIGHT if youve never seen it. Everyone in it is excellent, and its one of Cassavettess best films.#1
6908_2#This series had potential, but I suppose the budget wouldnt allow it to see that potential. An interesting setup, not dissimilar to  lost  it falls flat after the 1st episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90 minute film, but the makers chose to drag it on and on. Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and did not work overall. There were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame--- well, one grew a bit. The ending was as terrible as the rest of series. The only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers, they created an interesting look, too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element#0
10744_8#The events of September 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two French brothers. In my view it would have been better to leave this out. I think the directors tried too hard, perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop. The comment of one of a policemen -  this aint f   ing Disneyworld  is apt. Nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events. The filmakers were in all the right places at the right times, no other footage from the day matches what they shot.#1
839_1#The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female lead and the FBI guy went to the alleged killers location, Mr. FBI handed the female a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. One is left to ponder would an FBP agent hand a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Ms. Xavier appears to be a very attractive female. It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen. It would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out.#0
6346_2#This movie stinks! You will want back the two-plus hours it takes to get through it. Sliding Doors, w/ Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda tries to do much much MUCH better. That movie was clever, witty, and well-acted. I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths -- or rather the characters she played -- and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic. Sad, very sad.#0
10314_4#As someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale, I was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been. Id like to see this movie re-made and done better, because it is a one-of-a-kind story.#0
5001_1#I dont know why Im commenting this stupid reality-show I happened to watch a few episodes of(a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something,I didnt watch the entire thing though.Only like three episodes)as I was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day.Maybe Im just bored today-) I feel sorry for Britney,I really do.For all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity.Or shes self-centered to the extreme.She married the nitwit Federline(okay anybody can make a mistake) and before that she  starred  this horrible show about her everyday life with him,where she shoves a camcorder wherever she feels like it,no matter if it is in someones face or into the shower as Federline is standing in there. Shes babbling about her sex-life without leaving anything to your imagination,I dont care for my part,but I cant help wondering how she feels about it now when shes divorced.And yes,for her sake Im embarrassed.But I shouldnt be.She seem to live a pretty empty,shallow life though.I dont want to swap lives with her even if I could. Road-kill TV if you like.#0
10035_9#I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast, and  unsinkable  until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film. So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). Theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying ( http tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber)(idk he was so nice), Lovejoy(David Warner), Murdoch(Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith(Bernard Hill), Molly Brown(Kathy Bates), and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome#1
7186_7#There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but its a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. The plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering., and theres lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits borrowed from this serial.#1
10141_9#I was all ready to pan this episode, seeing that this Master really doesnt have any horror films under his belt.. but this is easily the best episode of the season. Really good effort. Like Ive said in other reviews- these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes.. but they may someday end up being masters in the future.#1
2256_8#Did not know what to expect from from Van Dammes partner & friend /trainer/and his fight choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him act as  TONG PO  in  Kickboxer and other Van Dammes films. Now hes on his own. He and his wife make a great team. In this one Qissi is the action director and lead bad guy and hes good. Really meanacing. His wife was the writer, producer and directed most of the scenes which didnt require action. She also did good job editing the film. Together they did a great job. The story made sense, the fight scenes were edited well, the leads were real fighters and looked good together - the story came together well, and if you can beleive itno bad language, no sex, just action. A new one on me. Check it out #1
704_1#A slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of NewOrleans black women by white men of power and privilege. Ooh. Does that whet your appetite? Well, then, belly up to a VHS or DVD and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history. For good measure, its adapted from the book by celebrated hack Anne Rice. The directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog. Most of acting is amateurish. The productions sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors, all of whom have scarcely been in employed in todays market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that have barely been seen at all (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). It also is, despite itself, a sterling showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and ponderous James Earl Jones is on-hand as well. So, is the late Ossie Davis, a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This film should be rated  T  for tripe.#0

6949_1#After a lively if predictable opening bank-heist scene, Set It Off plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink. This is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling. In short, its no different from 90% of Hollywood product. But its the racial angle that makes Set It Off a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making. Posing as a celebration of sistahood, the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating Afican-American gangsta stereotype. The gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. Worse, Set It Off exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. Serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then theyre ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring, guilt-ridden liberals (tell that to Rodney King), and aspirational good sista, Jada Pinkett Smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend. Set It Off illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the hood while all the time despising it. While the likes of Shaft and Superfly in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. Set It Off wouldnt be worth getting angry over if wasnt a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of African-American film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s.#0
3513_10#Actor Herman José plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the Benfica (club of its heart),FC Porto, therefore these players did not play well, and it wanted that the FC Port was wronged with this. But what happens is that these two players after all are good and FC Porto sell them for much money to a foreign club, making a good business. The film, for a small country as Portugal, without great antecedents in great films, is a very good and funny comedy, showing all the rivalry that exists between North/South of Portugal (FC Porto/Benfica). Highly recommended#1
1985_10#Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being Reviewing The Situationsung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin.I wasnt old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was Who will buy my wonderful rosesso i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a timeless musical you definitely couldnt remake it,it stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i dont think it would have worked so well if it had been.I dont think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well.Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you dont like musicals give it a try any way,theres something for everyone in this film.#1
81_1#Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldnt wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isnt one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.#0
3689_2#The main aspect about the Superstars movies at his later stages were the frequency, the lacuna between one movie and the next. Being a well established star of the south Indian cinema, the feedbacks he was receiving before Baba was great.  Youl feel very much depressed not because the movie was bad, itl be because of the superstars image going down. It took him five full years to regain it fully back with two movies Chandramukhi and Sivaji and give fans back what they really look for in a superstar film.#0
2092_10#I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved her Oscar. I came away from the film thinking YES! Having seen Muni in only one film where he was quite hammy, I expected the same type of performance here. I was happily proved wrong. Although some might criticize him as being too childlike and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of Asians, I thought he was just right in the role. Keye Luke, if hed been given the chance to play a lead role, might have played him in much the same manner. I was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the sacking of the palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and grim atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this an epic quite unlike others of the same time where it was all glitz and glitter. I watched this film from beginning to end enthralled. I cant say the same for the  epics  of today.#1

10306_4#After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling. In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I thought that my profession was being joked about. I am not a mathematician, instead a chemical engineer, but I do work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to  make-believe  of fairy tales. For some layman, the show might work. For others, the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow #0
1562_10#Show favorites Green Arrow (introduced this season), Aquaman (introduced in Season 5),  Impulse  (Season 4), and Cyborg (Season 5) all come together, along with Clark, to stop one of Lexs evil plans in this thrilling mid-season episode. This episode is incredible. Full of action, humor, and fabulous dialog, it feels more like a movie. It is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season.#1
5779_10#For starters, I didnt even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. I have not once seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. It is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and clever animation I have witnessed in years. If you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. Once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. One minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains though, where is the DVD?!#1
9491_10#Henri Verneuils film may be not so famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre. Action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed. After several years of investigation, special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman. But one man - prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks theres something more to be investigated and so the film starts. This movie doesnt deal with some exact theories, but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in todays world. Such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose its actuality. Furthermore, its even a bit frightful how precise are its oracles. 10 out of 10.#1
1990_2#This could be a strong candidate for  The Worst Flick Ever . Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, it could be tolerated as a kid-film. However, the TRAGEDY of this entire endeavor, is that John Hurt, one of the screens greatest actors, diminishes himself in this.I gave it two points just because Mr. Hurt SHOWED UPI take AWAY 8 points, because he didnt run from it fast enough. As far as the rest of the cast, they are, simply, terrible. Janine Turner, as pretty as she might be, cannot act to save her soul. And the lead actor is, for all intents and purposes, AWFUL. If you can spare yourself this embarrassment, please do so. Its so bad, it almost HURTS.#0
5534_4#Im working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the set. I am watching them with my soon-to-be seven-year old daughter, which makes most of these movies a laugh riot. I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the credits for this movie; but, of course those were his eyes (from White Zombie) serving as the mind-control device for the zombies.#0
9945_8#First things first! This isnt an action movie although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable,winning a game or tournament beyond expectation! In this case it isnt about football or baseball,but Taekwondo! In the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing! But soon we will find out that they dont want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life! It is nice to see them struggle and training! I was surprised how funny this movie was! From start till the end you will laugh your pants off! The young korean actors are very convincing! Go see this wonderful feel good movie!#1
10775_3#This movie is horrible! It rivals  Ishtar  in the number of embarrassingly bad moments. I would have rated it lower than a 3, save for a couple of funny lines; but, overall, this film was crap! It looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere. Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the directing sidelines forever #0
9705_10#This is probably the best television show Ive ever seen. I first saw it on Comedy Central several years ago. At the time I was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order, and having just watched all three series in order and unedited (thank you internet and your wondrous  series of tubes ) I am SO GLAD I rediscovered it! I think Comedy Central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a  season and I tried to get friends and family to watch it, but nobody really seemed to like it (I need new friends). So, on my own, I made the best out of it that I could. Even when I felt like it was waning a bit, I still felt compelled to continue watching. Years after when I discovered Little Britain, I immediately recognized Pauline from LoG as having influenced Marjorie in Fat Fighters. Also, I love the idea of writers who act the entire show.(not new, but done impeccably here). LB has nothing on LoG! (No offense, Matt & David.Love you)! This is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius. Serial murder, implied cannibalism..you name it and its probably found in this wonderful, unique piece of TV art. The location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of Royston Vasey..Youll Never Leave! I think my favorite character would have to be Tubbs, but each character as portrayed has its own  charm . My least favorite was Papa Lazarous, that was until he re-surfaced in series three (clever and wholly unexpected)! Its best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as I said before, becomes so compelling (while repulsing) that you really CANT stop watching. This is not for those with weak stomachs, kids, conservatives or Grandma (unless youve got one saucy granny)! I have always loved British TV, particularly comedies, from Monty Python to Benny Hill, Red Dwarf to Keeping Up Appearances, Absolutely Fabulous and the British originals Coupling and The Office (but not their US counterparts.sorry). This is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between whats funny and whats just sick and twisted. Nothing, NOTHING on US TV has ever come close to this level of entertainment. US broadcast TV is so sad and lame, I can barely stand to watch ANY of it. Its kind of sad that even our cable channels dont have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem (your loss, Comedy Central). Thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the  across the pond  that redeem the entire medium every decade or so. Basic cable here in the US has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently  crossing lines  with more graphic sexual content, drug use and adult language, but they are still years away from just deciding to be Adults about showing real life, adult behavior (instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up, sheesh, its like the same basic show format for the past 35 years)! Dont even get me started on US sitcoms! Waste of time and lots of wasted moneydid you know that  According to Jim  has been on the air for 10 years??? 10 YEARS?? Anyway Watch this show, get it on DVD, do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well! Youve never seen anything like it. There are three specials that I have not watched yet.Im saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits. Hell watch them, even if I have to chain him up and paint him with Excrement! Lines and lines and lines and lines! Note that series three departs from one and two.the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters, the laugh track is gone (thank bloody hell), the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of Royston Vasey. Dont be thrown by any of that as by the end, the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two. I think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable. Brilliant, confident and absolutely demented. You will want to re-watch it again and again. Its amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight-gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close-up facial expression. If ever I were to meet any of the writer/performers, Id implore them not to recreate it or try to top it..Id just say  Can I help you at all?  (Then theyd probably slap me, so Id ask them to sign the slap-mark)! 10 out of 10#1
1040_1#I cant believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long, long time. Bad film-making is not  different , its just bad film-making.#0
1577_9#SPOILERS WITHIN. More of the same please, Margarethe!#1
654_10#In what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual  revolution  (purposefully I use quotations for that word), Jean Eustache wrote and directed The Mother and the Whore as a poetic, damning critique of those who cant seem to get enough love. If there is a message to this film- and Id hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this Ben-Hur length feature has to offer- its that in order to love, honestly, there has to be some level of happiness, of real truth. Is it possible to have two lovers? Some can try, but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want, or feel they can even express to say what they want?  Sad to say, before I saw Broken Flowers, I never heard of Eustache or this film, and procuring it has become quite a challenge (not available on US DVD, and on VHS so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries). Not a minute of that time was wasted; the Mother and the Whore is truly beautiful work, one of the best of French relationship dramas, maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid Ive seen from the country in general. Its complex, its sweet, its cold, its absorbing, and its very long, perhaps too long. Its also satisfying on the kind of level that Id compare to Scenes from a Marriage; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each films release.#1
11408_1#This was just plain terrible. I read this book for school, i made As on all of the tests, and to see it like this! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was terrible. Third, it was like completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad I asked myself to be excused. Basically, I would rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this. Take my advice, dont watch this film. No one would want to watch this. It was horrible. HORRIBLE!#0
1465_3#Well first off Id like to add that I myself is somewhat of a historian so what I look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts. But this is however not the case here. Sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it isnt entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying. Hitler wasnt anti-semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before world war one. It was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the Jews. His upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child wasnt a disturbed little brat. He had a more or less normal upbringing. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is Hitler. It gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this.#0
8483_1#I normally only write reviews for movies I really hated or really liked. And, as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there, I didnt like it. By now, I assume you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie, so Ill skip the summary. Lets break this down, pros and cons Pros The Naidu Character Possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy.#0
4782_9#Well, it definitely is unlike anything else directed by Lynch. No supernatural stuff, no violence, no profanity. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful flick. Its a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because its the story of an old mans 6-week(thats my best guess for its duration) journey. The characters are everyday people and thus, they are believable. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Everyone who has a sibling can relate to it. Lyle and Alvin dont even have to say anything. For a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten.#1
8069_8#Victor McLaglen, the title character of John Fords THE INFORMER, reminded me of the circus man from Fellinis LA STRADA. Anthony Quinn played the brutish man, who may have even been influenced by the pug-faced, Oscar-winning performance given by McLaglen. Poverty-stricken Dublin is the true-life, atmospheric setting of the picture, which takes place in 1922. Dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep Irish patriotism and the fight of the Irish Republican Army. The conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes THE INFORMER tick. McLaglens large, simple character just wants to go to America and were reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently. Two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken Irishman. One is the previous, the other a WANTED sign. Should he do it and get the money to go? See the film to find out the gritty details. See it also for McLaglen and Fords patriotic portrayal of the IRA. Max Steiners score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters, placing more emphasis on them. This was usually only seen in silent films, especially Chaplin. The topic of naming names or  informing  is obviously still important. Just look at how the media covered this years Oscars, giving much attention to the Elia Kazan scandal.#1
3845_4#Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I felt that the film wasnt the best I had seen. At the end of the movie I was left feeling like there was something missing in it. In the end, the acting was what came through and not the plot. The ending scene was particularly good, but I am not one to give it away. Although others may find this movie good, I was one who found it so-so. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person.#0
9727_7#Simon Pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from England to work for a big American magazine. Of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications. Amusing fact based comedy that co stars Kristen Dunst (looking rather grown up), Danny Huston, and Jeff Bridges. It works primarily because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We completely understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups. I liked the film. Its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies. 7 out of 10#1
775_7#Its a strange, yet somehow impressive story, about love. Personnaly, I never run over such a twist-off story in real life. But, I can image there is. This movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moraland wheres the limit between them. I dont know if the idea of this movie is  love conquers alleven social and moral standards  or  love is beautifulno matter how or where . But in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think#1
6225_8#This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and/or shared between the principals. As usual the storyline neednt detain us though for the record it was based on a play, Shore Leave, that also served as the basis for a Broadway Musical, Hit The Deck. Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the movie but what matters, as always, is the music, lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle. Its a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1) we get to see Astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs, one of which, Im Building Up To An Awful Let-Down, had a lyric by Johnny Mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman, albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner Ginger before the story starts. He gets to perform a little-known but excellent Berlin number, Id Rather Lead A Band as well as duetting on Im Putting All My Eggs In One Basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of World War II were already being felt - Lets Face The Music And Dance, one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team. So what if Randolph Scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and Harriet Hilliard doesnt exactly set the screen on fire; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is, do they deliver. Answer In spades.#1
7392_8#I like this film a lot. It has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is pretty universal, the story of the prodigal son. The aspect I like the best however was the way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story. As the father told the son the story of his wifes family in the northern deserts of china, the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual. Water was so scarce that a simple bath had profound depth and meaning. Overall the film was very effective. There were moments, however, when it verged on  too  sweetbordering on cloying during the park recital scene. But overall, I highly recommend this film.#1
5398_1#This self-indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on Mr. Branaghs career as an adapter of Shakespeare for the cinema. (Released 4 years ago; not a peep of an adaptation since.) I just finished watching this on cable -- holy God, its terrible. #0
6583_4#Interesting idea and storyline which didnt quite work. If the victim Alicia(Mia Kirschner) had been more of a nice girl, we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice. The problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead. I cant understand the moral message of this film, and as a detective story and thriller it doesnt work.#0
3164_10#I cant believe we dont have that 70s show anymore. I have all 8 seasons of that 70s show  I absolutely Love It  I lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before I go to sleep. At the end of a long busy day its nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep. I was so sad they took the show off air at least we still have the re-runs  I am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunionLike maybe when Donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and Eric get married  Wouldnt that be awesome  It would be even better if they would continue it for several years #1
2639_1#Lets first start this review with the fact that I SIGNED UP JUST TO WRITE THE REVIEW AND WARN PEOPLE TO SAVE Their MONEY  I can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It can be best compared to a remake of the  The Fugitive  /  In The Line of Fire  but written by people with mental disabilities#0
10097_1#I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspect. So Im not expecting much. But it should at least have a story. Stories dont cost a thing except time..apparently, they didnt have any time either. It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off. I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb wont allow me to use decimals.#0
2970_10#I thought that Baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen! Its witty humour made me giggle all the way through, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so over the top, boosts the films comedy.  P.s Does anybody think its weird for me to like them both? hehe#1
3299_1#This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was actually expecting a bad movie but I was caught by surprise believe it or not. The storyline is the traditional, all clichées are included. I can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all, I feel robbed of 2 hours of my life.#0
10210_3#Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now only seems to do  by the numbers  Hollywood thrillers. Watch any episode of CSI instead. Its to the point and far more exciting.#0
5644_2#Whatever happened to British TV drama? From John Major through Tony Blair, the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative women-focused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionals. Lynda La Plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics ; evidently Paula Milne isnt up to the task.#0
7264_8#I have to agree with Cal-37 its a great movie, specially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and cute, of course Jim Belushi has earned his strips! But want I really liked was the piano song, if youre a musician or not watch this movie just for that, youll know which it is. Nelson#1
4175_8#I always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them Well, in time I wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia. Or did that  feeling  decide to pack its bags and say  goodbye  somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history, and then never came back? Or did it? Because for me, it came back the first time I saw  Ekspres, Ekspres . And it was its old self again. Treat yourself. Watch it.#1
10871_4#I had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novelso invariably my expectations were crushed. But they were crushed more than should be expected. The movie would have been a decent movie if I had not read the novel beforehand, which perhaps ruined it for me. Again, this film would probably feel much better if I had not read the book. I would not recommend it to book purists, though. I would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate French version come out the year before.#0
4191_1#I have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to. This movie made me angrier and angrier as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. Now, after Ive seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when youre watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters ( The highway belongs to meME! ), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the  plot , but still youll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy who isnt wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road. Blech.#0
4256_4#Ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee Is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him, he was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is funny as Luke, the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal Draculas body from the slab. Diane Neal Is good as the woman who steals Draculas body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend, And Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Giving a better performance than Gerard Butler did the count in the original film. Roy Scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie, and he does a decent job as the mentor of Jason Scott Lees character. This is the second sequel in the trilogy, and they are off to a good start. Its up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note.#0
11857_1#Worst movie ever made  Please see the Real movie reviews from the pros on this movie.Check Rotten Tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film. The comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film. I find the positive comments very misleading. I find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an Academy Awards Speech. Dont waste your hard earned money  This Film is retarded  I cant believe a film like this would ever be made. Why would Hollywood waste their time on such junk? This film is an attempt at nothing. I ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash. I went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money. I didnt listen and I did waste my time and cash. Please dont make the same mistake! It really is the  Worst movie ever made!  #0
11625_4#Except for the Brady Variety Hour, this was some of the hokiest television Ive seen in a while. The video production qualities werent too bad, but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80s. And Marie Osmond looks like she did battle with the Avon Lady.. and lost big time. WAY too much eyeliner. As of this writing it is 17 years later and it hasnt opened yet (Unless you count Disneys Animal Kingdom.) All in all though, for all the shortcomings, this still an interesting visual piece of Disney history.#0
2862_10#My comment is limited generally to the first season, 1959-60. This was great family entertainment, and the series stands up very well by any measure.#1
6652_3#This was a strange kind of film about a low-lifes in New York City and centering around a main character (the title name, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he s a Ricky Nelson-type musician, except he has no real talent.  The hairdo on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to look at. I can picture Johnny Depp playing this role better. One last note it odd to hear a film made in 1992 (other than Woody Allens) with just mono sound.#0
10355_9#Fascinating movie, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her baby daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the womans conviction, based on barely any hard evidence. I love films that question the media, and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system. Ive always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties. Its not, as has often been said, a liberal movie, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge. A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it engaging.#1
9122_1#An unfunny, unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to Peter Sellers career. It is a pity this movie was ever made.#0
6704_9#For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem hidden away on TGIF (and later, early school-day afternoon reruns). Each episode had a maniac, zany energy and rapid-fire pacing that overcame the occasional awkward joke. Melissa Joan Hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy, particularly in her facial expressions. Her two aunts, playing the  straight men,  or as straight as two witches could be, had great comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a talking cat, was free to dabble in whatever mad scheme he was interested in, and one could laugh and take it all in stride because he was, after all, a talking cat. Sabrinas friends rounded out the social experience at school, in which also housed the typical  evil cheerleader  and  totalitarian principal.  Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture (e.g., bands of the era, Jerry Springer), archetypal human condition/morality (e.g., the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas), and the literal representation of such related metaphors in the Magical Realm. Unfortunately, like so many other shows throughout the age of television, the show hit its peak during the first three years, which coincided with Sabrina attending high school. Starting in season four, the move to college marked what would become a precipitous decline in the general quality of the show, particularly when the writers chose to introduce Josh as Harveys rival, and concocting thin excuses for Aunts Hilda and Zelda to remain on-screen as key players. The final season, where Sabrina works at a pop culture magazine, was unequivocally disappointing. Still, in the end, Sabrina (particularly the high school years) remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that elevates it above the tiresome fare that is produced in this genre every year.#1
1464_7#More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho does sound better as a header. The man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you will) does depict movies here in his own way. Most of them are classics, but all of them are listed here at IMDb and Id strongly advise you to see them (especially the Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, Conversation & and the Lynch movies), because Slavoj Zizek will reference them!  Zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if youre open minded to see things through another perspective (even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you  it doesnt mean it will do that, but it could)!#1
4794_4#Why watch this? There is only one reason and that is for the greatness of John Saxon. I love his acting. My most favorite appearances by him are in Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3, and 7 as Nancys father a cop, Black Christmas as a cop, and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a cop. When I was rummaging through my local mall video outlet I came across the film Zombie Death House and I quickly tossed it back but before moving on I noticed that John Saxon was not only an actor in this film but for the first time that I have ever heard of a director. This intrigued me (Also the cheap $9.00 price tag) and I and I had to have it. Upon coming home I realized that this film did not live up to Saxons other work even his acting, which may have been muddled by the added pressures of directing. But it was not just him the other actors sucked too. It seemed as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porno shoot and told now guys you really have to act. The film even looks of 80s porn quality. I cannot in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers, but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80s who missed out on the culture that came from that era by being born to late, or a fan of crap films than this one is for. Also if you dig John Saxon as I do.#0
10718_4#Come on Tina Fey you can do better then this. As soon as the movie started i knew how it would end. Sure it was funny at times. Even laugh out loud funny. But there isnt enough laughs to save this movie. I dont recommend buying this. At the most i recommend renting it but thats all. Baby Mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for. 4/10#0
1394_4# The Brain Machine  will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what its all about. Four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment. Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed. You may want to catch this flick if youre a die hard Gerald McRaney fan, could he have ever been that young? James Best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend, but dont call him Father. For something a little more up his alley, try to get your hands on 1959s  The Killer Shrews . That one at least doesnt pretend to take itself so seriously.#0
2769_10#This film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950s and 60s. But it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves. The best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer. This is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like David are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws. I dont see this movie on television much anymore, but when I do I never fail to watch it. I think it still holds up very well today.#1
1679_9#Im really tempted to reward  The Case of the Scorpions Tail  with a solid 10 out of 10 rating, but that would largely be because I think Italian horror cinema of the 1970s is SO much better than the cheesy crap I usually watch. But even without an extra point for nostalgia, this is STILL a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story, uncanny atmosphere, blood-soaked killing sequences and superb casting choices. In my humble opinion this is actually Sergio Martinos finest giallo, and that has got to mean something, as  The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh ,  All the Colors of the Dark ,  Torso  and  Your Vice is a Locked Room and only I have the Key  are all top-notch genre achievements as well. But this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultra-compelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control. Following her husbands peculiar death in a plane explosion (!), Lisa Baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and shes eager to leave the country as soon as possible. Due to the bizarre circumstances, the insurance company puts their best investigator Peter Lynch on the case and he follows her to Greece. There, Lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the cases mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money. Im always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because I dont want to risk giving away essential plot elements. In  The Case of the Scorpions Tail , the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway, and I certainly dont want to ruin this for you. Many red herrings follow after that, but Sergio Martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and, even though not a 100% satisfying, the denouement is at least surprising. Its also a very stylish film, with imaginative camera-work and excellent music by Bruno Nicolai. Everyone s favorite giallo muse Edwige Fenech oddly didnt make it to this cast (she stars in no less than 3 other supreme Martino gialli), but Anita Strindberg ( Lizard in a Womans Skin ,  Who Saw Her Die? ) is a more than worthy replacement for her. The charismatic and hunky George Hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and  duh  ladies man deluxe. If youre a fan of giallo, dont wait as long as I did to WATCH THIS FILM #1
4956_10#This movie is really genuine and random. Its really hard to find movies like it in bunches of movies now in Hollywood. I really enjoy watching this movie, i bought its DVD Tuesday this week and ive watched it for 4 times. I love the Spanglish accent of Paz, it s just really cute as she is. And her acting and Morgans are so funny and natural. This movie might be cheap in the making price but its meanings are totally not cheap. I rarely can learn anything from movies, but this is an exception.#1
5958_9#Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like, some you dont. A few are related--mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not one smooth, happy with everyone and everything, type of life--much like real life. Some story lines do not evolve, they just happen. But like true families and good friends, they stick together. The wanna-be parents who are buying a baby are such a--holes! You are happy for the ending. Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself, her mom, her son, and trying to keep all their lives together. This does not end with a sunset walk or house in the burbs and all are living in a dream world, but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day, month to month. Overall, this is a good story and a great movie #1
5144_1#The orange tone to everything was just yucky. Oh yeah, the main character lives in a ghetto that is all orange-tinted with orange-tinted people. Meanwhile, to mentally escape from this crushing poverty of the body, she plays a full-immersion video game (which sucks in that no rules are clear and no logic follows the gameplay). She apparently earns an income playing the game but she is revealed to not be an employee of the game company?. Lots of non-speaking pauses later the story drags on slowly. She uses a glitchy orange computer interface with an operating interface that is so visually annoying and I can only suspect a Microsoft future release. After that, it ends. Good riddance. I hope the director chokes on it. Im putting this HACK on my  avoid at all costs  list for any other films his name is attached to.#0
9983_7#This movie is about basically human relations, and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past, doing an analysis of how she lived her life. This journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home. It is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy, real love, marriage or destiny. although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new, this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable, but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.#1
2058_9#This film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre - amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts. Average montage scenes, 30-somethings playing teenagers, and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the  new-wave  of modern classics. As a viewer, I came away from the film with the same sense of  shock and awe  as when I first saw The Godfather in 1969. Tiffany Gardners startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt Judy was deserving of her Grammy nomination, which was well documentedly stolen by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original (unlike the Godfather series which got better with each installment, and should culminate in 2012 with Godfather 4 Eat My Rage.#1
11041_7#This film centers on four criminals, locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell, hoping that a mysterious book of black magic, penned by a former inmate around 1920, named Danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young. Im glad I had a chance to watch this film. It does play out like  Monkeys Paw , the characters get what they desire, but a price must be met. Theres gore in the film, startling moments of graphic violence, but, in my opinion, this is first and foremost a story-driven tale. The gore is a product of what the book unleashes. One of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air, while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one mans desire. We see Danvers fate at the end, with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away. Lassalles fate is a masterful effects sequence. I will say that Maléfique, through Eric Valettes well paced direction, always kept my attention, and, for being such an isolated movie(..about 95 % of the film takes place in a singular location, the prison cell)it never seems to drag. I guess thats a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations, not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them.#1
12138_1#Serious HOME ALONE/KARATE KID knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot. You could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene. Oh, and the acting sucks too. Although I must say that the line  Sorry, dude, I have to take a major dump big time  made me laugh my ass off.#0
2883_1#This movie is just so awful. So bad that I cant bear to expend anything other than just a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible. Seriously, dont even think about watching this one. Id give it a negative star if I could.#0
12362_1#I saw this movie in NEW York city. I was waiting for a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was raining, and did not want to wait at the PORT AUTHORTY. So I went across the street and saw the worst film of my life. It was so bad, that I chose to stay and see the whole movie,I have yet to see anything else that bad since. The year was 69,so call me crazy. I stayed only because I could not belive it#0
10157_10#This is an entertaining look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course) who sings a lot and narrates a bit also. If you like Johnny Cash, this film is quite enjoyable. Also note the blonde depiction of Jesus in this workjust for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blonde hair? Anyway, its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all.#1
11804_4#This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise! Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we get Samantha Eggar, who comes off like a standard-issue villainess from  Barnaby Jones.  But who can blame Eggar? With a director who barely seems interested in whats happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come off well?#0
3597_2#Well, there you have it, another disillusion on my account. Two, actually! First of all, even though I like to think of myself that I know a little something about 70s euro-exploitation and its most prolific contributors, I never heard about Joseph W. Sarno before. Heres a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult-laden exploitation movies and I havent seen a single one! How? Why? What happened here? Secondly, and even worse, just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies, that directors most famous and supposed  masterpiece  turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film. Admittedly, lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole, but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality (like José Larraz  Vampyres  or Harry Kümmels  Daughters of Darkness ). Joseph Sarnos film has nothing to offer, except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly. The events take place in a secluded old castle, hidden deep in the German mountains, where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty (literally) baroness. Her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castles catacombs, which are lit by penis-shaped candlesAUCH, and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now. Suddenly (dont even ask how) the castle is full of young and sexy female guests, so even more erotic rites ensue. Sounds delicious and entertaining enough, but  The Devils Plaything  contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable! Sarno isnt capable of creating suspense or building a Gothic atmosphere (or maybe he just didnt bother to) and the actresses capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face. Please do yourself a favor no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian-vampire movies of the 70s, this one isnt worth a penny! Even the repertoires of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are pure art compared to this dud.#0
4132_1#Feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other. We havent seen stuff like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like. Always sounds great on paper when youre splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like Beethovens symphonies. Then you come to writing it. Great ideas like all vampires are female. Ergo hot, seductive deadly but in a way I want to perish sort of way. And all zombies are men. well thats what men are like to a woman just after shes been dumped or cheated on right? So it all looks good up to actually making it. Then the rot starts to set in. Mosters have fight. Nothing much happens. Another fight. Philosophical noodling and cods wallop. Eureka weve found how to win. Big fight again and the End. Sounds great doesnt it? If it was made an indie company it would be great. But this is Hollywood with the eye on the bucks gloss instead of what the fans want. It all could have been gore soaked beautiful.#0
3525_7#Man, this is a hard DVD to come by. I could only find it on Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. Glad I got it.#1
4362_2#A group of human looking aliens going to Earth to eat crash land on a planet of prehistoric beasts instead where they all eat physcedelic mushrooms and act retarded. Padded with footage from  Planet of the Dinosuars  and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss. The acting is atrocious as well, and while this isnt as bad as  Chickboxer  (what movie can be?) This is still pretty awful repugnant stuff. Its 90 minute running time feels like an eternity and you will likely be cursing life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on, skip this crappy film, theres nothing to see here. DVD Extras Joke commentary, 17 Behind the scenes featurette; 7 minute Into the black featurette; Jessica Mills reporting; Stills gallery; and original trailer#0
6648_7#I just came back from the Late-night cinema and it was indeed a silent way out as most of the audience pondered though the real-life black & white images of the partition,the freedom movement,etc which was very much reminiscent of the lives our forefathers faced! Amidst this backdrop,mind you,there was no tel/fax/internet in those times but for the very voice of Truth & Non-violence, the cinematography infused some spirit of stark reality of adversity amidst the strict Raj. A pity that such naive harilals are still ruining the efforts of many Mahatma-like fathers in many families in todays life and have taken to drugs,alcoholism and God knows what thoughts Heres a message to all those brave sainik(soldier)-sons please respect the father of the nation!Please Obey and happiness shall be bestowed or else its a disaster in waiting,isnt it?#1
9511_7#A bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of Great Depression. It tells us about another notorious hit-man, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story turns the other way round Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss. He succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son, but gets killed in the end. Such stories never have happy end after all. The role of Mike Salliwan senior was wonderfully played by Tom Hanks, and the part of Mr. Rooney (the Mafia boss) was performed by Paul Newman. The film makes a great impression, and we hear the well-known phrase  we rob banks . This film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from Sam Mendes after his American Beauty.#1
4051_4#Lindsay Anderson was very much a European film maker , whereas the likes of David Lean , Ridley Scott and Alan Parker make spectacular movies involving visuel scope Anderson`s movie are more about social commentary and subtext , so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience  What you think of IF comes down to what you think of British film makers . I`m very much of the view that cinema should be a universial medium ( The best Brit movie makes are those who try to emulate Hollywood in my opinion ) , if you want to send a message try pony express , and I find the movie dated , pretentious and too set in the 1960s . 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in France . You can just imagine every single French leftist worshipping this movie especially the climax . French new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it , and many will dislike it intensely#0
6420_7#This one is a great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film. This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist Master diver. Along the way, he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. They move out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Watch this one! Its a great tale of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time.#1

2433_8#I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic  Casper the Friendly Ghost  cartoon. Figured it was an early one since Casper didnt look  right , the same way Porky Pig doesnt look  right  in the old 1930s cartoons. But I digress Id give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second only to the Warner Bros. cartoon  Peace on Earth,  this is the most Ive ever been moved by an animated short.#1
4537_3#I actually didnt enjoy this movie. I saw it at a camp, and we didnt rave about it, we laughed at it. Sure, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole overall movie idea is terrible (now, I know it was based on a book which I havent read, but I hope that the book was better than this, because frankly, I thought that this movie was very bad and boring). Like I said, I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus I got a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, I struggled to stay awake. The only thing that kept me up (other than my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up) was the gunshots, that were quite pointless as well. I just really didnt like it.#0
7724_10#Sure Star Wars (a movie I have seen at least fifty times) beats all the others in special effects, but this film has every thing else! Honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles.#1
8552_3# just look at the poor Robert Webber character (great performance, once again!) who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies (the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic, ironic and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas like when a commando shouts heads down  all good guys do it and all bad guys dont so that they can blast away ad lib (with a good conscience), that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously. And it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun. Dont talk about the toilet-mirror-signal episode  I dont mind the criticism of the Pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled, even headed representatives of power in this movie. But the political comment is rather lame and uninspired. This is insofar regrettable as the movie features an early performance of Judy Davies. She plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject . Anyway, her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow I feel the movie let her down.#0
10779_4#I found this film to be an utter dissapointment. The talent available to the director- notably Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main leads)- have been completely wasted on an unfunny, mediocre story, whose conclusion one couldnt really care about once introduced to the dire, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is feeble, Zeta-Jones is just plain annoying (appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour), Crystal just plays his same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and Cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project. A very poor 4/10.#0
913_10#This is one of the best movies to come from Bollywood in years. Certainly the best this year until now. Indian to the core, the panoramic visuals, the heart-pleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one. The apt depiction of Indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for his/her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life. The movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage - yes, thats right, it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents, and learn to love each other. The 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time, not full of  enticing  happenings, but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other. They learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives, and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage. But have these been strengthened enough? Their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune. Will they pass this test? That is what  Vivah  is about.#1
779_10#In Northeastern of Brazil, the father of the twelve years old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life. However, the girl is resold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) that deflowers her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in Amazonas and explored his owner, the despicable Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro expecting a better life, she is explored by the cáften Vera (Darlene Glória). Title (Brazil)  Anjos do Sol  ( Angels of the Sun )#1
4339_10#This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey. One sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that  history repeats itself . Life is what it is shown in the movie when people are young, they seem not to understand their parents, their own spouses; people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late; people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved; nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world, and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves, so that when life has to end some day, people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope ---a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. They have understood the directors intention perfectly. The movies charm lies in, to me, the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience.#1

8619_1#If you want to see womens breasts, get a porno. There is no plot, but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan. The only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny, and, yes, boobs are boobs.#0
2963_1#Ever since I started visiting this site, and voting for movies, I have never given any movie a rating of 1. Even the disturbing  Dance! Workout with Barbie  got a 2. There is a reason for this. Anyhow, all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if youre one of the five or six rabid fans of  Howard the Duck , or if you are curious to see the most Evil Insane movie of all time, or you want to REALLY punish yourself.#0
3253_3#I actually saw China OBrien II before I ever saw the original China OBrien. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But worse = funnier! And funnier = better. If youre a bad movie fan like I am, this is great material. If, however, you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot, acting ability, or movie-making skill, this is best avoided. The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast-forward. Hilariously bad. See it for a laugh, see it for mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, see it for free on TV.#0
7082_1#Ok, I wrote a scathing review b/c the movie is awful. As I was waiting another review (for Derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie.

ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE #0
2782_10# Bend It Like Beckham  is a film that got very little exposure here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the U.S. Its unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here. I think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end,  Bend It Like Beckham  proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting. I was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now I regret not seeing it sooner. I highly recommend this movie #1
9467_1#If you liked the Grinch movie go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers Cat is probably the most annoying character to  grace  the screen in recent times. His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater. Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes Back in Action if youre really looking for a fun holiday family movie.#0
5903_1#I live in Salt Lake City and Im not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well because I live in Utah and thought itd be nice to see locations I know in a film. I really knew going into it that I wasnt going to get the inside jokes so I wasnt surprised when I sat with the deer in the headlights stare. What I was surprised at was the ant-non Mormon actions that were placed in this film. I guess I just dont get it because I dont belong to their faith and I guess I never will.#0
4515_1# Piece is Cake  is defeatist, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the (admittedly fictional) pilots it portrays. It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.  Piece of Cake  is an absolute, total misrepresentation of the way pilots in Fighter Command acted at the time. It is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace#0
6268_1#Nightmare Weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had, if you can imagine that. There is no decipherable plot or story, the special effects are a joke, and even the sound is terrible. This film was directed by Henry Sala. It was the only film that he ever directed, and the reason is obvious.#0
9697_8#This is a really heart-warming family movie. It has absolutely brilliant animal training and  acting  (if you can call it like that) as well (just think about the dog in  How the Grinch stole Christmas  it was plain bad training). The Paulie story is extremely well done, well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too. Not more to say except that this is a GREAT MOVIE! My overall rating 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WORTH WATCHING #1
3273_3#The Dukes of Hazzard is quite an achievement  a $53m film thats worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25-year old TV show. The plot is serviceable enough but the mindless fun is rarely to be found and the casting is pretty atrocious Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than protagonist, M.C. Gaineys Sheriff Roscoe is a bland thug, Michael Westons Enos tiresome, a seemingly ideally-cast Willie Nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to clear and Burt Reynolds, stuck in some purgatory where hes doomed to relive his old movies as a bit player, is a curious choice for Boss Hogg to say the least but does have one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill. You know a film is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen presences But worse than the script or the casting is Jay Chandrasekhars hopeless direction seemingly born with no conception of comic timing, unable to do much more than basic two-shots and seemingly clueless as to how to shoot a car chase let alone the couple of decent stunts in the film, he seems determined to sap the film of any signs of life before they materialise. There are a couple of neat post-modern moments revolving around the Confederate Flag and Daisys stereotypical role in every episode, but no film that makes you pine for the days when Hal Needham was directing this sort of thing (and badly) can be a good thing.#0
11491_8#The Unborn is a very, very different film. James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the film and they performed quite well. this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going. Though I think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot. There is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like Me thats into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but thats it when it comes to that. There is a scene where Adams character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real. The music is very different but very good. The Unborn in My opinion is a really creepy film thats superbly unpredictable and thats quite strange! I recommend all horror fans to this movie!#1
3238_9#The Finnish version of Robert Altmans  Short Cuts , set in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. The other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the  routines  of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy). Compared with Altmans classic, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.#1
3494_9#For what it is,  Raising Victor Vargas  is about as close to perfection as a film can get. Either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked (probably some of each), this simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds. The film begins with a strong flavor of  street  but works its way into a Latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another. In my experience, never has so much been done with so little (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.). Praised by the critics but not for everyone,  Raising Victor Vargas  is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness. (A)#1
5559_7#This was stupid funny movie.. Cheech and Chong are the dopiest wasted guys ever i rate this film a 7.. but if you like this one then go see Jay and Silentbob! There funnier and crazier. Now Cheech is a sellout working on kids movies.. wheres chong?#1
3842_3#Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I havent seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I dont think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldnt see this movie, even though its PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I dont even remember what it was about, once was enough!#0
3890_10#This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years. His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it. I HIGHLY recommend this one. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the ending jokes in French are quite good, because you dont have to speak French to get it (although if you do, it is still hilarious). Also, the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but funny the first time. Skip over those if you can. Its almost not worth watching. However, this really is a funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see.  I was dead at the time!  #1
3901_10#This video rocked! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I have ever seen. Not only does he have class, he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that I have ever seen. Eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic Ive seen in a VERY long time. Tell all those other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this  executive  reign #1
11787_9#Its a short movie from David Lynch with just 8 minutes, but it got all the  Lynchian ingredients   Its mysterious, dark, inconclusive, eerie, and strange; and before the blond girl starts to talk its even a bit scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because its also sinister and mysterious  Its a great short, despite some amateurish acting. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting could have been better in this short.#1
9396_9#In any number of films, you can find Nicholas Cage as a strong, silent hero, Dennis Hopper as a homicidal maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vamp/tramp, and the late, lamented J.T. Walsh as the heavy. These are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep, and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche. What a relief, therefore, that John Dahl, a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action, directed this nuanced noirish thriller. Hopper manages to keep from going over the top, Cage shows a little more depth than his usually-superficial action heroes, Boyle is by turns sultry, innocent, and scheming, and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character, Wayne. Dahls direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the Big Sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store. The plot twists are top-notch, and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains. It isnt often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors. But with a director as smart as Dahl, you shouldnt be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film. An excellent movie.#1
6870_4#A well-intentioned movie about Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger), the wife of devout Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy. Mendels brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field in which shes already an expertjewelry. He also starts an affair with her, and then when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he dumps her and betrays her to the family, which shuts her out. Theres a subplot in which Sonjas dead brother talks to her, and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman, but why is not clear. Much is not clear, unfortunately, including what is going on with Sonja, why she tells the Rebbe theres a fire inside her and maybe its not from god, and what this means, and what the magical beggar woman tells her means. To an extent the story touches on the plight of women in the ultra-orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not exactly liberated. Nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well-thought-out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the worth of a good womanand yet its the bastard Sender who quotes it to Sonja. Zellweger struggles with the part; shes supposed to be a Jew from the mid-west and sometimes her accent is flat, and at other times its taken on the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn. Shes at her best when shes being tough and taking charge, but ultimately the movies a mess.#0
7300_3#This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends catches a horrifying flesh-eating virus. Suddenly, the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves. Some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateurish. I didnt care for most of the characters. I liked the plot but the execution was done horribly. As a horror film, I didnt know what it was trying to be. I didnt find it funny, tense, nor scary. By the end, youre left indifferent, thinking,  What have I just been through?  Unfortunately, youll never know the answer to that question.#0
7914_2#This film was slated to be a blockbuster film, and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the movie delivers, perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man, but well enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects, the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. Very disappointing#0
5241_3#Tell the truth I’m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie. And after having seen it, I was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie. Rating 3.5/10 (Grade F)#0
5998_10#The Cure is an amazing filmSo suspenseful and just so REAL! I was lucky enough to catch a screening of The Cure at its NYC premiere and it completely blew me away! I also heard it won an award from that particular festival, and it definitely deserved it. The first thing that struck out at me was the cinematography. Eric Giovon did an amazing job. The shooting style of the love scene halfway into the film was amazing. A love scene was necessary in this film, and Jafri got the point across but also kept the scene tasteful. Giovon and Jafri make an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together on future projects. Judy Maiers narration was so surreal but simultaneously heart wrenching, it made me feel what the main character felt. Im a very tough critic but i must say The Cure is one of my favorite films..JUST LOVE IT! If you havent seen it yet, check it out!#1
12235_7# The Incredible Melting Man  is a fantastically gross, trashy and energetic Z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself! The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70s gem is like a shameless copy of Hammers  The Quatermass Xperiment  only a thousand times filthier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and  causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The melting dudes face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs screenplay doesnt waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film. Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, youll miss out on all the campy fun #1
8414_7#The Student of Prague is an early feature-length horror drama or, rather, it is an  autorenfilm  (i.e. an authors film). This film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cinéma, or just make a profit, by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen. Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Mussets poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe, it centres on the doppelgänger theme. (Note The first version I viewed was about an hour long (surely not quite complete) and was in poor condition, with faces bleached at times and such. Im not sure who was the distributor. Ive also since seen the Alpha DVD, which, at 41 minutes, is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards, but is visually not as bad. The repetitive score is best muted, though.)#1
7211_1#I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off Inspector Gadgets Field Trip. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever. Tip for those who havent seen it NEVER see it. EVER. Watch the cartoon, its a true classic.#0
8027_10#When I saw it for the first time I was really impressed.The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. Through all the story spectators can expect that Richard will really kill Thomas or he will do it first.But..the main point was not conflict but..FRIENDSHIP!Older and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to life.It is amazing. Every time I watch it I enjoy!Of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but I think it is acceptable. Thanks a lot Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing film!I advice everyone to see it.I am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time.#1
2908_8#A journey of discovery, this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy, island town in British Columbia. Languorous and dreamy, the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young, fresh-faced teacher, with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland. Slowly, their indolent state is awakened, the father (and principal of the local school) looks for excitement, the mother for stability, the oldest daughter for love, and the youngest for power. While not an incredible or ground-breaking piece of cinema, the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside of Canada will find it easily accessible.#1
7580_7#As much as I have enjoyed the Hanzo the Razor movies, three is definitely enough Whos Got The Gold?, the final adventure for the Japanese lawman with the impressive package, is a fairly enjoyable piece of Pinku cinema, but offers little new in terms of ideas whilst taking a big step backwards as far as outrageousness is concerned. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.#1
464_10#I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves, then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering. Her eyes are the mirror to his soul --and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are. Those who take things literally will find Marleen Gorris poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating. Romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded.#1
11359_2#While the 3-D animation (the highlight of the show) did its job well, most other elements fell flat. It was as though the filmmakers thought  well, its gonna be 3-D so we dont have to work that hard on the plot or character development.  And the fact that its a childrens movie is absolutely no excuse. The public is drawn to three dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemos Dad) just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics. The only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional Scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight. ??? ??? Did you just wanna tell the kids the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus dont exist while youre at it?#0
11949_8#Woody Allens second movie set in London. Tha Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love. Shes helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who doesnt like what he sees. Worth seeing. I give it an 8.#1
7239_2#This film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy. It is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not an effective comedy. The fortunes of the well meaning yet pathetic character,  Tom , oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only saving graces are the competent performance by Toni Collete and the frequency with which we glimpse Paltrows pleasant face. Overall, to be avoided #0
1646_9#Portrays the day to day stark reality of survival on a ranch in the old west. Outstanding acting by both principal actors. This doesnt even feel like a movieyou feel like youre there. Animal activists should bewaremany scenes are obviously not just realisticthey are real.#1

394_3#I cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema. So after watching the trailer for  Water Lilies,  I expected to like this film because I thought Id stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of  Beautiful Thing.   All in all,  Water Lilies  was very disappointing. Will an honest film-maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! No - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with. And yes, to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema.#0
4532_7#This was Keatons first feature and is in actuality three shorts, set in different periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age) on the eternal triangle of romance. The stories parallel each other as in Griffiths INTOLERANCE, which this was intended to satirize. The strengths of the jokes and gags almost all rely on anachronisms, bringing modern day business into ancient settings. Lots of fun and full of laughs.#1
9776_8#Its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one, but for me Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the 00s and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. An anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor-Eriksson Group, a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche, with unpleasant results that echo down the years. With bookend segments set in India the film is made chiefly of three stories set in Germany, illustrating the aftermath of the work of the Taylor-Eriksson Group, with some pretty nasty gore at times. Its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. Bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients, healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals, dark forces unbound by time, place or even personality. Good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably his wonky (lazy?) eye, we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient. The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as Eriksson healing a fellow patient, also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen, a face with lazy eye like Erikssons. There are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others. There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from Hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that I did on wikipedia). Writer/director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film. As well as being thoughtful, the film is pretty chilling too, the soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances, Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. So, the film isnt quite as gripping as it might be, the acting occasionally off and the pacing too, but mostly I thought it was pretty great, if a shade short of its possible brilliance. Well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think.#1
1969_1#Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended Im sure. If you found this movie to be entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, avoid crap like this.#0

In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for, but if youre looking for hard hitting, award-winning drama, go watch  The West Wing  or something.#1
829_7#I will admit, I thought this movie wasnt going to be any good but I soon changed my mind. The movie was keep you guessing as which direction its going. Pierce Broson is amazing in his role as a hit man, who suddenly becomes burned out & asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is an awesome straight man, as his role as a mild mannered man from Denver, who starts a innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar. The movie will have you laughing as Pierce delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex). The imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially at the bullfight scene & when Pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs.#1
12124_8#This 1934 adaptation of Somerset Maughams novel put Bette Davis on the map as a movie actress. She might have won an Academy Award for her performance but the films was made on loan, so her studio didnt push for her. Her acting in this one doesnt come off well by todays standards. As the heartless waitress who jerks Philip, a sensitive medical student, around and nearly ruins his life, Davis is way too shrill, almost demonic. Director John Cromwell, who usually elicited good performances from his actresses, was perhaps overwhelmed by this one. Davis is watchable, for sure, but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human. I imagine the character of Millie as quieter, less feminine than Davis, with maybe a touch of the tomboy. Davis is such a strong, immediate presence thats theres no air of mystery to her, which makes Philips attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be. Overall, a very good film, a little stilted at times, due to its age, it evokes London nicely, and is well acted for the most part.#1
7913_10#This has to be the all time best computer animation classic. Even though most of the animations where experiments. They have an artistic quality that has stood the test of time. Twelve years after its release, I have gone back to watch this video and found some inspiration for new types of computer graphics. Some of the techniques used in this video have never been full explored.#1
5378_3#I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they dont half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I havent even mentioned the killer, Im not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as Im concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasnt because of their acting talent, Ive certainly seen a lot worse, but Ive also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.#0
12244_1#This film is awful. The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI. The crocodile looks like a large gray smudge. The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive. It is mostly a photo-shopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed, and I have seen lots of the very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. Aside from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is composed of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as Waiters/Waitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building (and crushing Kate) the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water. No laws of Physics can apply to this movie or the special effects. At least there is honor among crocodiles.#0
965_4#First I liked that movie. It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments. The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best  The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste  But the script writers disappointed me extremely. The best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Dont like the ending. The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright. It would be OK, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dancing scene  ))) But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (its a long time!), she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend Philip Train (Ryan ONeal), she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years  It would be a good movie, if not the ending and some missed human psychology.#0
5065_2#This movie is just plain bad. Weak story , weak directing and below average acting. The thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising - constantly - for a well known internet provider. It is obvious some scenes are written to do just that , advertising. This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this. Do not watch this, it not worth your time.#0
12452_1#This movie is so bad that I cannot even begin to describe it. What in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? How on earth did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story What story? The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off. Do yourself a favour See an Uwe Boll movie instead twice its more worthy of your time.#0
7427_3#When a friend gave me a boxed set of  12 Amazing Scifi/Horror Movies!  I was understandably a little cautious. But, since the item was a gift, I really didnt truly pay my common sense much heed. After all.movies for free! So what if they are a little ropey. After much consideration, Alien Intruder was the first of those movies. Ironically, it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch. All I can say is, if this is the best of them, I shudder to think what the rest are like. Its best avoided. Even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker, but at least you can fast forward it, I suppose.#0
4306_10#The mere fact that I still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film. To me this substantiates Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another. I truly believe that before the movie Crash there was Grand Canyon. The major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release. Im not going to argue which one is better, but I will contend to the idea that they share the same message. Id love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject. I will start a commentary which you can find at http www.myspace.com/62229249. You may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share, because i have a true love for film.#1
10449_9#I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when I heard it an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It sparked my interest, but I never expected it to be this great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and its also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. Its impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but its not JUST the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it. SEE IT!#1
6544_1#I paid one dollar for this DVD and at first I was feeling ripped off, but then I started thinking about it and I should be grateful. I have found a holy grail, a real touchstone of bad cinema. If you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully fizzle with Evels awkward camera address monologue, then wait until the opening credits roll on the chauffeurs butt. The script seems to be pasted together from press clippings, and ESL textbooks. But.. I just cant believe how bad George Hamilton is. He seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says, the only internal monologue I can detect is  gosh I bet they think I am cute. really cute! . This is an epiphany! I now know how bad it can get.#0
2668_1#do not be suckered into renting this movie. It has nothing to do with an escape from death row, despite the (english) title. I cant think of a single good thing to say about the movie. Poor acting, poor editing, poor directing laughable  plot , and the sound/music was so irritating, its a wonder this movie doesnt come with a warning label. The only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for its historical cheesiness quality. They just dont make films this bad anymore.#0
1007_1#I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film. I managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead (which, by the way, is great fun). Dont watch this film, it is a pure waste of time.#0

Perhaps should there be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a much-anticipated return #1
10619_8#Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach of  The Spy Who Loved Me  fame) and her two assistants Karen (the appealingly spunky Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the pretty Lois Young, who not only gets killed first, but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene) go to Solvang, California to cover an annual Danish festival. Since all the local hotels are booked solid, the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a swanky, but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky Ernest Keller (deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late, great Sydney Lassick) and his meek sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret residing in his dank basement a portly, pathetic, diapered, incest-spawned man-child Mongoloid named Junior (an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by Stephen Furst; Flounder in  Animal House ), who naturally gets loose and wreaks some murderous havoc. Capably directed by Danny Steinmann, with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast, a compellingly perverse plot, excellent make-up by Craig Reardon, a nicely creepy atmosphere, a wonderfully wild climax, a slow, but steady pace, likable well-drawn characters, and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame (the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch), this unjustly overlooked early 80s psycho sleeper is well worth checking out.#1

7054_2#This movie was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldnt even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris. It was pretty hilarious. The songs  Sini Ne  and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, it seems Emran doesnt have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time.#0
9278_4#The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about itor me. It is not a good movie. Terrible in fact.

I give it 4 out of 10.#0
8492_9#Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine, & he is absolutely hilarious in this movie. Matching him step for step is Gedde Watanabe. The two of them work wonderfully together. Although this movie is a comedy, I also like how it shows Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Watanabe) struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups. They both try so hard to keep the peace, & then they finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch). First, theyre both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunt jumps on the desk with him. The fight then spills out from the office into the factory. I love that after they are separated by the workers, you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand. Also, there is a scene where you can see the influence that Hunt has had on Kazihiro. He is at his house & his boss from Japan arrives & says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow  I guess I really like this movie because it is genuinely funny, & also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other, but become good friends as well.#1
6998_4#Hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a  religious picture.  Strange Cargo proves to be no exception. Although utilizing the talents of a superb cast, and produced on a top budget, with suitably moody photography by Robert Planck, the movie fails dismally on the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewers involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters. I found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and impossible to accept bathed-in-light Ian Hunters smug know-it-all as a Christ figure. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. Few Boston/Detroit/Providence moviegoers, if any, complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow become involved in a  message picture.  It flopped everywhere. Oddly enough, the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on TV. A home atmosphere appears to make the movies allegory more receptive to viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Strange Cargo flows along predictable, heavily moralistic lines that will have no-one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny.#0
10120_4#This Hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale. A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence. However, out of no where, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything--and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life! What an odd, silly and preachy film! Personally, Id like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable! The production values are relatively poor compared to later productions--a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting.#0
11013_1#Im into bad movies but this has NOTHING going for it. Despite what the morons above have said, it is NOT funny. I know comedy AND underground movies but this is so boring that the Director / Writer should be prohibited from EVER directing anything but local cable access EVER again! To love movies and comedy is to despise this film. I may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was. If you like this movie you ARE a pothead as sober there is NOTHING here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, see  Kentucky Fried Movie  or early John Waters. The movie starts by defining satire and I defy anyone to show me the satire. The rule for comedy is THIS  If its FUNNY you can say or do ANYTHING but if its NOT funny you are not satirical, you are not edgy, you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny. ZERO #0

11728_9#There are two things that I like about Elvira, and theyre both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up her wit and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention. Looking like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits a distant relatives estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling. Its mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels. My favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary. The ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the Bradys, but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie.#1
9191_1#Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze. Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. Its unbelievably bad. Just to let you in on how bad it is, Ill offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see corn filled crap like this? There is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. Im really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, Im dumbstruck. Its so bad I cant even find the words. RATING ZERO out of      .#0

5897_1#Acclaimed Japanese director Takashi Miike cant seem to get the wheels moving with this torpid thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimotos book concerning an evil old woman (and child abuser!) who is part of a new urban legend if your cell-phone rings with a strange tone--and you see the message One Missed Call--you will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death. Most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of Reality TV cameras intruding on the future victims, but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) are disappointing and dispiriting. The frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are actually displayed rather discreetly, and this overall politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid. Hollywood predictably jumped on the far-fetched plot in 2008, yet the U.S. version fared no better. NO STARS from     #0

1684_10#Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10% as deranged as the one in this film, well then I guess he could have turned out worse. Unfortunately, the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the pictures box office appeal. Several times during the film Milligans ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends, and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for Milligans homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60s guitar rock. Its pretty easy to fast-forward through if youre trying to pay attention to Milligans original film, which, unfortunately, is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes. What remains, however, is still compelling stuff. I dont think Ive ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before.#1
8353_10#I can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence. Back then it was UNRATED and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay televisionespecially back then. I would love to see it now as an adult where I would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it. It was probably the closest thing I had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8. Luckily I had stupid babysitters and party-going parents on the weekends. Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into houses to sniff underwear, feeding on a strangers breast milk on a public bus, and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off. A very racy film for the early 70s. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea this movie had such a following. Most people I talk to have never heard of it.#1
8246_9#OK, I didnt know what to expect when I saw the cover to Fido, honestly when I came across it in the video store I was tempted to rent this movie, but nothing about it really grabbed my attention. But when I was looking around in Netflix, they were advertising this like crazy if I liked  goofy  scary movies, so I figured to just give it a shot. Im so glad that I did watch it, this was just a great movie, it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch. Like I said, its Pleasantville meets Night of the Living Dead, its just a great concept, what does happen after a mega zombie attack? As we see in another zombie comedy, Shaun of the Dead, they have fun by making the zombies left over as  handy  citizens. This is a very overlooked horror/comedy movie, I think a lot of people were just so blown away with Shaun of the Dead that this got the boot. But its a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie. 9/10#1
8958_3#I wasnt really fond of the first  Cube  movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much. Didnt really feel the need to see its sequel but when I heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the originals problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. Well I thought wrong. Again failing to impress on anything but weak characters, dialog and acting  Cube Zero  is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie.#0
331_1#I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. Thats the plot.  Thats it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, its all over the place like a mad mans breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, throw both shoes at the t.v kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasnt for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian Accent ive ever heared, and you have something which i wont call the worst film ever made, because Going overboard doesnt even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing youll say after seeing a bad film will be  at least it wasnt as bad as Going Overboard .#0
2863_1#I was glad to watch this movie free of charge as I am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library. Nothing against low budget movies, but this movie has horrible acting and directing. How can a movie as this one ever be made. The director should be blacklisted, and for all the poor actors, it is for sure not a jumping board into a career. Please make sure that youll not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and directing awful. There are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the  LOW 10 . Another example would be  Dracula 3000 . People who make money with this movie should give it to charity, so at least it serves for a good reason.  In this case I would watch it even another 10 (or at least one more time).#0
5827_2#Dont get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos its ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is no worse than the US meat trade or the Scottish haggis cull), it stinks cos its pretentious tosh, the sort of up-its-own-behind guff that gets modern art a bad name. That said, there are some stunning images, but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so thats no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted, and then, just when you thinks its finished, it starts again. I saw it it in a porn cinema in Rome which had been hired for the weekend to show Barneys film works, which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the dirty-old-men-in-macs brigade, but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard-stroking Bjork fans were to be honest, everyone might have had a lot more fun if theyd just shown one of the pornoes!#0
5807_8#This is, in my opinion, a very good film, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. It contains a message on drugs, stunning special effects, and an awesome music video. But besides the bizarre robot scene, its a very good movie, and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.#1
1922_9#Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there. Upon his death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers didnt give up on the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005. 9/10 --spy#1
2617_10#I watched Lion king more times that all my friends put togther. Having a baby sister.. you know how it is. By now i memorized both the plot and the lines. After Lion king 2 came out i was like ok well let me see the second one was significantly weaker then i saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1/2 I was like ok there we go again. After watching the 1 1/2 i was like wow. All my expectations (for repetitevness) were broken. A truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time. I have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that ROFlmao will apply here 100%. I definetly recommend seeing the cartoon.#1
9718_7#POSSIBLE SPOILER - In some way  How to Alienate Friends.  is the  loser learns to adjust, becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more  type of story, situated in the celebrity business. - END OF SPOILER  Conclusion I think its a nice celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages, a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending.#1
609_1#This was an absolutely terrible movie. Dont be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem this movies ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actors like Christopher Walkens good name. I could barely sit through it.#0
11898_4#A police officer (Robert Forster) in a crime ridden city has his wife attacked and young son killed after she dares to stand up to a thug at a petrol station. After the murderers get off scot-free thanks to a corrupt judge and he himself is jailed for 30 days for contempt of court, he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled looking Fred Williamson. These Robin Hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to prosecute, and with their help he attempts to track down those that wronged him.. To conclude File under  Forgettable Nonsense . Next..#0
11853_1#Lets face it, romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies (just look at the Academy Award nominations each year). But still, the good ones are truly an art form. Look at  When Harry Met Sally ,  Sleepless In Seattle , and classics like  Roman Holiday  and  It Happened One Night . I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness. An art form this aint. Go rent  Moonstruck  again.#0
10212_1#They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station. They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived. You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot, four young boys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice over narration. Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion. Once theyre grown, its easy to spot the writer/director among the four. Hes the quiet, contemplative, long-haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants. This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. Only theres no writing, or directing talent on display here. And if you still cant figure out which one he is, heres a hint The auteur and his character have the same middle name. It took over an hour to figure out that these twenty-something men were supposed to still be in high school. What looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the warden turned out to be the principal. Once more, the poor, misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement, murder and pillage, but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father. How about hitting back, kid, like you do everyone else? Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose. Howlingly bad dialogue. Many scenes badly out of focus. Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras, drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience. Overacting in the extreme. And if you dont quite get the self-important speeches, or the slow-motion scenes, just listen to the overbearing music. It will clue you in and what youre supposed to feel. Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films. The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies, run over puppies chained to a tree, rob and steal, all the while complaining about their sad, sorry lives. But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college. Yeah, thats the ticket. Why is it that every twenty-something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important, so interesting, that the world cant wait to see it onscreen? If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems, then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants.#0
657_10#La Maman et la Putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects. True, the actors dont  act   True, they talk a lot But what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying. The very long monologue spoken by Françoise Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood, manhood and love. Not easy to translate accurately, though. This movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.#1
10437_4#Admirably odd, though mean-spirited comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight. Some of the cinematography is evocative, Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as Bud Corts vision of a  mother bird  (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her!). In the lead, Bud Cort is--once again, after  Harold & Maude --a true original; not off-putting like, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, wacky and inoffensive, a tough act to pull off. Unfortunately, this is one of Altmans misfires. He can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else, but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward.    from     #0
1162_9#Like most people, Ive seen Jason Priestley on TV and I think hes great. But I didnt know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply  mah velous as the scorned other woman. Good music, intrigue, and a death scene involving Amandas revenge on an abusive Dr. that will stay with you for weeks. Ill leave it at that. Kudos.#1
6628_7#Ive seen this film in avant-premiere at Imagina Festival in Monaco. Please excuse me for the spelling mistakes.#1
7439_4#A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. However from my American perspective this movie just wasnt that good. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille wasnt a pleasant character and I had a hard time identifying with her. She was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left. Also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film. Then a long time passed before any real suspense built up. Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and they didnt use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all Id recommend it for renting, but not for theater goers.#0
3843_3#In the days before gore and sex took over, real horror films were made. Castle of Blood is, in my estimation, one of the finest, although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others, which was in the theaters a couple of years ago. Sadly, few general interest viewers will ever hear of, much less see, this film. That is a shame, for this one is a cut above the rest. I got my copy from Sinister Cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else. For persons interested in this genre, it is a must see.#0
8462_3# Bullfighter  was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be The confusing storyline, the incomprehensible dialogue said by Oliver Martinez, and the annoying editing? Its got to be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) go on a mystical road trip. They meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too. The movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, when trying to subtle, dont call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments, and weak special effects. Dont be fooled by the cover Willem Dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most.#0
11243_10#I first saw  Breaking Glass  when it was released in England in 1980..I loved it then and having just caught it in August 2005 on a Canadian station it still is great. The only thing I regret is I cant find the sound track or the DVD in the stores??anyone care to shed some light or must I order it from some over priced internet company. But getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time, Hazel/Kate had something to say about 80s Britain..actually it was the same decade I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons one being  Thatcher  and what she was doing to the country at the time. Please if you get the chance watch this movie you wont be sorry #1
4497_4#- I had planned to write something explaining what I didnt like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I cant remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and its made almost no impression on me. Thats usually the sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but hes a one-note entertainer. The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them. If you cant spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killers identity.#0
2303_8#THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor (Jason London) who ends up falling for her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this familys dynamics forever. The 1950s are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately. Witherspoon already begins to show the Oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and London makes a charming leading man. Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls parents and Gail Strickland, who plays Londons mom. I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase  family ties.  #1
10287_4#This is available on a  Drive In Double Feature  from Dark Sky Films, and since I just had finished up  Barracuda , I watched this too. This is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time. So what the hell IS this? Im not sure, but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.#0
6446_10# Så som in himmelen  was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films I have seen in my life. That it did not win the Oscar, I will not shed a tear. This movie is in a kind of class of its own, that an Oscar win would possibly have detracted from it  My dearest friend Anders (Nyberg), you have done true magnificence with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation, and everyone contributing, you all have given a gift of Love to our world. Between the points of entering this world of ours, then exiting it - you really can say that you made it better! A special personal thank you from my soul to all of you, that you brought back some precious memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and present Beingness was formed and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude to you all. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa#1
284_2#I only today, picked this up at the 99 cents only store today, and I still think I got ripped off.  Dream to Believe  is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $1 is just too freakin expensive for this. This film is probably only notable for 2 things 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. Its directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also did Promo Night. Now onto the movie.  Overall, Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and its also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over, it fades to black, even though sound can still be heard. So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie, as its also not in the movie itself, so the covers obviously photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless youre a Keanu fanatic. I probably wont be hanging to it any longer. Im probably gonna give it to The Cinema Snob, whos a great YT critic btw. Hey, if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight, feel free to donate to him to keep his show running.#0
11228_4#The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. It plods back and forth between vignettes of Betties story and re-creations of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant, retro feel.#0
5903_8#I liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage. It is very clean you can see it with family. Very nicely done. Songs are OK too. I think the writer director is great. The movie shows how marriages progress thru time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogs are quite good. The movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization. Also shows perfect is after all not so perfect. Shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. The movie is very well written and directed.#1

4770_10#The only show I have watched since 90210! Why did they discontinue it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all! The least they should do is release it on DVD!  They made a big mistake by pulling that show. If anyone has any info regarding where I can obtain a DVD of North Shore please post a few lines here. Thanks! Aloha!#1
3693_1#movie goers - avoid watching this movie. if you are faint hearted, you might want to commit suicide. if you are a short tempered, you would want to kill the lead performer of the movie. He is the highest paid actor in India. That shows the taste of movie going public in India. 90% of movie goers in tamil nadu are definitely attracted to his kind of nonsense movies.#0
2089_1#Of course I was watching BG. I loved S1, I liked season 2, season 3 was OK, and loved the final one. Yay, there is a spin-off show! I didnt know about this at all, one of my friends told me about this. I was really excited. It is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch. Stargate ruined, BG over#0
11162_4#Jack Black is an annoying character.This is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds.Do I have to write eight more lines?Ana de la Reguera is dang fine to look at,as a Mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of Jack Black.This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie film.I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture.This movie explores Mexican culture-deeply. I just choke on its cultural rudenessJack Black is just so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary into Mexican culture, as it were.Mexican Wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy, such as myself could seek.I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black has presented here. I think IMDb changed my review.Has anyone else had his review changed as well?Just a question.#0
2373_3#WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS #0
579_1#Listening to the directors commentary confirmed what I had suspected whilst watching the film this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie. The plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when theyre going through that  I could write a book/screenplay/award winning sitcom  phase. Theres a germ of an interesting idea buried in there (probably because its a sequel to some-one elses movie), but it is totally buried under an underwritten, badly executed and laughably un-thought-out script. Frankly, as movies go, this is badly plotted, silly and forgettable. Even as trashy movies go its not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining. It could have been a fun and bloody little romp, but the director has left with more of a comedy, for all the wrong reasons.#0
11327_10#this movie probably had a $750 budget, and still managed to surpass Titanic. i rented this the day i crashed my moms car, and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief! it has to be tied with The Assult of the Killer Bimbos. Things to look for are 1. The drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2. The bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3. The Flinstone-like screech out driving 4. The clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed (dont worry, im not ruining any surprises, for its soooo predictable) 5. The guy who finds it necessary to howl. 6. The mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen. 7. The hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall. 9. last, but not least, the wonderful special effects--especially the stab in the boob that made a heaven help me popping noise. #1
244_4#The silent one-panel cartoon Henry comes to Fleischer Studios, billed as  The worlds funniest human  in this dull little cartoon. Betty, long past her prime, thanks to the Production Code, is running a pet shop and leaves Henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes. A bore.#0
11789_1#Actually had to stop it. Dont get me wrong, love bad monster movies. But this one was way too boring, regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts, was way too obvious a cliché. This film totally betrays the cover on the DVD which looks pretty interesting. From the cover one expects a giant monster, but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels. Moved on to watch another film called The Killer Rats but thats another review. Deep Shock was really crap, a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget.#0
709_10#Hello everyone, This is my first time posting and I just love the movie No child of mine and I could watch it over and over  well I taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and I dropped it and broke it and I havent seen it in a few years  could any one please tell me when it will come on again  I would really appreciate it alot You can email me if you want to cause that is my favorite movie of all including Empty Cradle to and if anyone knows when that comes on to PLEASE let me know,I would really appreciate it ALOT  #1
4465_7#ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but I wouldnt rate it up there with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors on leave in Hollywood who befriend a young boy (Dean Stockwell)who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson) a struggling actress who is working as an extra at MGM. Though both guys are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually voices a preference to Joe but Clarence later hooks up with a waitress (Pamela Britton)who, he learns is from his hometown of Brooklyn. The paper-thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including  We Hate to Leave , Joe and Clarences lament to their fellow sailors as theyre leaving the ship; Graysons torrid rendition of  Jalousie ; Sinatras dreamy rendition of  I Fall in Love Too Easily  (a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film), and  The Worry Song , a fantasy dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry fame. Kelly also does a sort of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his Pirates Ballet in the later THE PIRATE. Kelly is in peak form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatras endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy. An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM musical factory.#1
12218_1#Very bad. Very, very bad. As a fellow who aspires to make, be in or - at least - sniff the catering table at a movie set, I find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made. However, this movie  oh dear. Some good things. Not all the acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once she started fighting back. There was some neat imagery, unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason.  Acid Poptart  is a name that deserves a better movie. I like the moxie of Frightworld too. Next time, now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts, I hope all involve aspire to something better than Colman Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Wood.#0
7560_9#Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick.#1
11299_8#Well, Id heard from somewhere that Ossessione is a precursor to the Italian film genre, and particular favourite of mine, the Giallobut actually, aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in Italy; the two have pretty much no relation. In the sixties and seventies, Italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful American film released. Theyve not done that here, but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film The Postman Always Rings Twice, without giving the books author, James M. Cain, so much as a credit! Anyway, the plot focuses on Gino Costa, a handsome drifter who, by chance, stumbles upon a café where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works. He soon learns that shes married to Giuseppe; a big fat annoying man, whom Giovanna cant stand to have even touching her. He wants the pair of them to run away together, but shes not so keen on the idea. However, fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful Despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story its based on, it has to be said that director Luchino Visconti implements the film noir style well, and in a way I even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger American noir classics. The story is, as you would expect, extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast. Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much, however, and with a running time of almost 135 minutes, I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length. I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film, but its not a great film. The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly, and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters heads. Theres not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know whats going on, and by not always focusing on the characters themselves; the film is not as interesting as it could have been. Still, it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reasonalthough its not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M. Cain classic.#1
3353_8#This film makes a strong comment about the Italian people of the time. The use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and I cant not mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. Their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there. The husband, in his brief role, is also excellently portrayed as the fascist Italian who commands his wife and children but, in his own way, a loving father. The beginning scenes with Hitler at Piazza Venezia with all the Italians is incredible and really places the film historically. I loved the film and I also agree that it is funny it isnt more renowned.#1
11148_9#Midnight Cowboy was rated X with the original release back in 1969. There are some scenes where you can understand that, just a little. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York City to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing. Dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler, making money by the act of love. It does not work out as he planned. After a guy named Rico Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends. They live in an empty and very filthy apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money. The movie was probably rated X for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things. The editing in this movie is great. We see dream sequences from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the supporting actors give great performances. Especially Hoffman delivers some fine famous lines. The score is done by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes this a great movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for a good reason.#1
5403_1#I gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less. We can only hope that a sequel isnt planned.#0
9456_8#Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance shocks by its plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the films effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters ordeals horrifically real. The movies plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. The films cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to banjo territory - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a regions tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.#1
7504_7#Hey guys Im actually in this movie! I didnt even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised! I played Pete, the main characters son. It was a great experience and i loved every minute of it. While filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a body double! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine. I still act and do some TV, but not as much. Oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll. Review I thought the movie was okay but if i wasnt in it, it wouldnt be one of my favorites. I thought the acting was really good, but the story line was only so-so.#1
9947_1#This movie was horrible. I swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell.

The ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs. And when ICE-T is on that Hill and uses that Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN like its a sniper rifle (and then cuts down a tree with eight shells?? It would take 1000s of shells to cut down a tree that size.) Shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light?? I didnt see a scope on that thing. Also when he got shot in the gut and kept going, that was retarded he would of bled to death right there. PlusThe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel. It wouldnt blow up and kill him. The bullet would still fire kill Ice T but mess up the barrel.#0
4068_10#breathtaking, this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made. i first saw castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and it left a lasting impression. years went by and i forgot the title of the film, and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again. after reading other peoples reviews and analysis Im not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression. a true fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults. its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind. if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it. theres not much to say about this piece of art but if youve not seen it watch it and enjoy.#1
8595_1#Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them. Rating 0 out of 100.#0
3634_8#I had low expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something unchallenging for an evening. I walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised. This is a very fine baseball tribute film, and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role, and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time!#1
798_10#This excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. I really did cry in the end (which I dont want to give away!) It also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder.  The cast was also very good. The only bad cast member was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job, but the director didnt. I say this because he found someone who didnt look a single bit like Anne Marie Fahey herself.#1
505_9#A very good start. I was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced It should have been cruder, to match we saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, although the Vulkan lady comes across as a little too human. She needs to school on Spock who, after all, is the model for this race. Too bad they couldnt have picked Jeri Ryan. I like Ms. Park, the Korean(?)lady. The doctor has possibilities. Havent sorted out the other males, except for the black guy. Hes a really likeable. Bakula needs to find his niche--In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. He is, of course, big and strong enough for the heroics. The heavies were OK, although I didnt like their make-up.#1
9554_8#Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies I have ever seen. That it has never been released on either VHS or DVD is truly a shame, since so many bad movies are released every day.#1
12257_3# Its not like that big mechanical toy , says a character early on, commenting on  Jaws . Well,  Blood Surf  would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the  Jaws  series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Acting and directing are not much better, either; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than to a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but for the audience too. Saying you  liked  this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap, further destroying the poor horror genre. ( 1/2)#0
4939_1#Peeew this stinks! As everyone knows its based upon some Geico insurance commercials; what no one knows is WHY?! Those commercials were amusing on first viewing at best; hardly fodder for a series. (The talking Geico gecko -- thats another story. Now that would make for an intriguing series!) And why on earth did ABC -- as reported in the press -- actually agree to buy the cavemen character rights from Geico for this? After all, the idea of cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to TV; Phil Hartman had a recurring Saturday Night Live role as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago. And thats how a concept like this works best -- as an occasional installment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960s series called  Its About Time  also used the cavemen in the modern world concept. It lasted one season.)  In the annals of bad TV, this is destined to take its place alongside 1972s  Me and the Chimp  as one of the all-time worst. The lead actor in the embarrassing Chimp fiasco actually went into shame-by-association hiding after it was abruptly canceled. No doubt our cavemen friends will follow suit.#0
12401_8#2003 was seen as the year of the Matrix, with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film. Also released was a DVD of 9 short animated films, most written and made in Japan and made as Anime. Japan makes some of the best animation in the world. Sadly most of these shorts are disappointing. The best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first Matrix film. The only real complain is a continuity error to the first Matrix film because Morpheus mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war. But its a good watch.#1
10737_3#I saw the film at the Belgrade Film Festival last week, and Im still working off the trauma. Essentially my view seems to match a number of others - the first half hour was fresh, sharp, deep, entertaining and promising. Well acted too. Natural. My problem, however, is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning, nor the fact that I spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp, grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken, toothless, bread-chewing hags. Its rather with the fact that THEY NEVER WARNED ME  The festival brochure synopsis described only the (utterly intriguing-sounding) first half hour - a whore, piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar, pretending to be an advertising agent, genetic engineer, and petty government administration official, respectively - making no mention whatsoever of the never-ending gum-smacking to come. Serves me right for not reading the reviews, you might say - but to my defense, a number of reviews I looked at post-fact um didnt at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film. The first hint should have been the introductory words by the director (a bashful, tousle-haired Russian youth) who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium (the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically, and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening, though most of the audience seemed as unaware as I was of the pain to come, judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour, and many exasperated comments on exit) to say the following Well, I um, thank you very much for coming to see this film, and I just wanted to say well, its a very long film it took me four years to make it, and its.. I suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it. It is very long. Thank you for coming. This is what he said. Alarm bells should have been ringing. Whats he talking about? I thought in happy confusion. This is gonna be fun  Of course, by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me, it was far too late to get out. All I could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again. And in the end I cant say I feel in any way improved by the experience. Yes, I absolutely loved the first half hour. It was intelligent, new, and had a lot to say. And yes, Russia is probably in a bad state. Yes, every society has many hidden faces. Yes, toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard. Yes yes yes. I get all of this. Really I do. But I see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out, and so painful to bear. If you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy Hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging, try the Korean-Chinese Bin Jip (3-Iron). Its artsy and surprising, but also to-the-point and fun.#0
252_4#Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which hes shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.#0
10995_1#Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie back in 2001. It looked like it could be funny, but I wasnt about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first. I figured I would wait until the movie was available to rent at Blockbuster. Id have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible. Sick, desperately tasteless, and poorly written and directed, THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time. No stars.#0
8275_1#(First of all, excuse my bad English) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this.. Im a norwegian and I felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this American/ Norwegian  movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. That was all.. Lenge leve Norge ! ;p#0
360_10#11 Oscar nominations and zero win  Am yet to understand why - its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc- were all amazing - i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the Oscars that year it should go into the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges.  I own it and I watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.#1
3063_10#A first time director (Bromell) has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged, middle class, depressed hit-man and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as the 6 year old son of William H. Macy is the most refreshing little actor Ive seen in awhile. Macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. Its always great to see Donald Sutherland and here hes wonderful as the callous father of Macy. The films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast, locations, and filmed the movie. The basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded. The cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background. Any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if hes a fan of contradiction.#1
7703_8#I was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. The Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, yet the specially effects when the Krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago! Living in the middle east I saw shades of Islam creep in when JJ Adams suggested Alta should dress more modestly, and as an engineer, was amazed by the imagination used for the futuristic gadgets, and gizmos dreamed up by the props department. All in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a young man#1
7791_1#Ive seen the original non-dubbed German version and I was surprised how bad this movie actually is. Thinking I had seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and such, nothing couldve prepared me for this! It really was a pain to sit through this flick, as theres no plot, no good acting and even the special effects arent convincing, especially the so-called zombies, wearing nothing more than white make-up and their old clothes, so their good set wouldnt be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains.  If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then watch it, for all the others, dont do it, because you WILL regret it!#0
4582_3#If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $9 on a used textbook, not this movie. Im a little worried that the money I spent is being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipment to Guyana.  I dont think the directors really got any point across, but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several 1) Science can explain everything we do, meaning that our lives are deterministic; 2) Science cant be used to explain everything we do, meaning that we have free will; 3) Science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a tough role to follow and 7) here, put this tiny paper square in your mouth and youll see some really groovy stuff.#0
6921_9#Keep in mind Im a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time. How Ive overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me. To me this is a better film then the much lauded  High Noon . Its a great western with excellent acting and a great story. The DVD is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you like westerns or James Stewart this film is not to be missed.#1
6615_8#I am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with Karas and the Tasuiev sisters, RENAISSANCE. None seems to have noticed that RENAISSANCEs poster features a Rourke look-alikethat guy is Marv; which doesnt make it a SIN CITY rip--off, but not a paragon of originality either, and in fact theres more resemblance to the Miller talenamely, the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society, the brio of the hero (in fact a cross of Willis character and Rourkes persona in the previous movie )on the other hand, this cartoon breathes a more public air, a brim of straight adventurousness, and, in a word, its like SIN CITY for kidswell, naughtier kids I mean, cause theres a bit of nudity on display. To what I have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic, even as clichés and common places of the futuristic more adult comics look; true enough, and it was oldie Miller to have brought that things on screen and RENAISSANCE bears some resemblances here and there. Now its also fair that every RING ought to have its ERAGORN, so to each sin city, its renaissance. I admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales, a rather undemanding specialty.#1
6107_7#After, I watched the films I thought,  Why the heck was this film such a high success in the Korean Box Office?  Even thought the movie had a clever/unusal scenario, the acting wasnt that good and the characters werent very interesting. For a Korean movie I liked the fighting scenes. If you want to watch a film without thinking, this is the film for you. But I got to admit the film was kind of childish 6/10#1
7884_1#Things I learned from  The List . Apologies will not be accepted.#0
8281_7#From the first scene, I was really excited.  I can tell this is going to be awesome!  I thought. The acting was so good, I felt as though I was eaves-dropping on these peoples lives. The music too was exquisitely unsettling. The plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward (one could sense) toward some irrevocable fate. The build was slow, but I personally love that kind of thing, as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesnt get derailed before its ready to pay off. One other comment. Some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether I should be scared or laughing. I dont know how to explain it, but there was a distinctively Monty Python feel about this monster in his more blatent  monster  forms. Although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie--I dont know, it still worked for me in some crooked way. I will never look at deer antlers in the same way again! )#1
9867_10#I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in 02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It had some sort of warmth. All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.#1
9900_4#I suppose that any novel thats as much of a downer as Moby Dick would not find much favor with Depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence.  Id see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.#0
9312_10#I love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the Friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana. THIS IS BEST MOVIE.#1
151_1#This is really terrible. I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable.#0
9906_10#YES, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. YES, the acting does range from average to laughable. YES, it has been done so many times before. However what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. There are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie. In addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing. I urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be; a scary, funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none.#1
10820_10#I borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating, because I wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds. As a matter of fact, they didnt - at least, so its seems. Some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie - thats it, this is what the majority of viewers think. However, the surprise comes at the end, and unfortunately then, when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie. I was also astonished when I saw that the Brazilian-Portuguese title of this movie means  Voyage into Death . This is THE spoiler. I cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie, the movie-makers  cheated  an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film-student elaborate with hastily  chosen  pseudo-actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers. How mistaken can one be! But in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes, the end that follows gives another surprise. The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat. When she has recovered from her shock, she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends. And there they are again! They wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore. She jumps into the water, arrives at the boat - and they are away. Miraculously beautiful. It remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a Rhetoromance writer When I awoke, I saw Death standing at my bed. But I closed my eyes. When I opened them again - he was gone.#1
10164_7#This is a great film. Everyone has their own tastes but I really dont understand the one star reviews for this.#1
9942_1#At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue. This is absolutely not a girls film. Any blokes who like it, are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from. Dumb story, mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film. Ive seen many, many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category. If you do happen to see it, the one thing youll look forward to is the ending. So you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can.#0
1616_4#STAR RATING       Saturday Night      Friday Night     Friday Morning    Sunday Night   Monday Morning  Without the flitting between time and places of the last film, Soderberghs second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills, and manages to be an even duller experience. And more pretentiously, the score has been drowned out, giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating. Theres just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up. You cant fault Soderberghs ambition or Del Toros drive in the lead role, its just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn.   #0
9151_10#Savage Islands raw savagery will scare the hell out of you! Trust me. In fact, the film has won SEVERAL horror film festival awards.#1
1501_7#An excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything. Its a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates, all tied together by a wrap-around story about a Scotland Yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star. It starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum, then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but, and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film starand what he does to the inspector. Its a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and youve got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just dont answer the phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the English countryside#1
11746_2#Well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype; From the buzz at the Toronto Film Festival to gushing reviews on CBC Radio. A refreshing, wacky, hilarious indie movie apparently. Id been looking forward to it for months. If you want to see a genuinely funny, bizarre movie involving aliens then try Repoman. There is no comparison!#0
4554_1#Bingo is the game, bullshit is the name. Rarely has the screen been smeared with such a blown-up hodgepodge of half-baked conspiracy theories, puritan prudery, and new-age gibberish. The bulk of the story is set at Viciente, a Cristian resort in the Peruvian jungle. Think Tolkiens Rivendell meets Star Treks Planet Baku, inhabited by dimwitted followers of a not-so-mysterious, but surprisingly narrow-minded cult of love and peace. Thanks to gruesome acting and tacky production design (the rainbow-colored visualization of the mysterious all-healing  energy  is particularly hideous),  The Celestine Prophecies  looks and feels like a discarded 1980s  Twilight Zone  episode. Factual errors regarding church history and nomenclature abound. I cant believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be a part of this. Maybe it was made without his consent, Bowfinger style. May the Lord have mercy on the director, the screenwriter, the author of the novel, and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book.#0
4099_8#OKthis ones a weirdy.Honestly, I cant tell you all the inner plot-points of THE BEAST, cuz I started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes - but just wait, it definitely does  pick up  THE BEAST is a film that I find kind of hard to rate. The cinematography itself is quite eye-catching and the sets, costumes and locations are elaborate. The plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat-bear. A good bit of tits, ass, and hairy 70s French bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film. I have to honestly say, that if it werent for the graphic scenes of the BEAST spackling all over the willing maiden, this film would have been a real bore - that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex (the beginning has a VERY up-close and personal scene of two horses boning, including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vaginaYUM ). But the BEAST sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film, that I have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer. I have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks theyve seen it all - the BEAST rape really is out-there and something to be witnessed. Also recommended to any fans of 70s/80s sleaze films - this one ranks pretty high with them. Worth a look for you sick rat-bear beastiality lovers out there (like me)8/10#1
7499_3#John Leguizemo, a wonderful comic actor, is a New York Latino, able to get inside a myriad of characters, both male and female, to show the bizarre foibles of an ethnic group trying to cope in an alien culture. He is not, however, Italian. He doesnt look, think or behave ItalianEspecially Sicilian or Calabrese, immigrant groups who live in Bensonhurst or Bayridge Brooklyn. Every scene in which he interacts with his  Gumbas  rings false, as though hed wandered in from a college production of  West Side Story  while the other guys were doing a low-rent  Mean Streets . Thats only one problem with this ill-conceived, mean-spirited flick. Spike blew this one big time.

9759_10#I believe I received this film when I was a young buck. I remembered watching it as a child, but i could never find the film. I remembered good ol Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the Greedy, King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this movie and still no luck. But one day when I was moving out of my childhood home I had found it. We were reunited. I am 17 years old now. I still watch it. All the time actually. Its one of the funniest and touching movies I have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should make a sequel. Mmm, yes a sequel indeed. Now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body!#1
9229_2#This is a movie about making a movie. Such movies may be entertaining, but they need some substance, to do so. It did not happen here, I am afraid. Mr Coppola did not inherit his fathers skills, unfortunately (neither did his sister, who can however make movies which one might watch). Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You must be really joking#0
4695_9#What ever happened to Michael Keaton? What a great actor and he proves it in this movie. This movie is actually FUNNY! And the reason why this movie is funny is for two reasons an excellent script and Michael Keaton. This movie is one of the funniest comedies in the history of Hollywood. This movie is the ultimate spoof of gangster movies. In this movie, Hollywood actually pokes fun at itself by using the the gangster movie genre as the basis for a truly original comedy. The rest of the cast is funny too, especially the supporting cast. If you like to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains nonstop humor, then this movie is for you.#1
11059_9#The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shellys  Ill Take You There  is not overt, but clearly has ties to his work (Shelly has acted in two of Hartleys films). Not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative, but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light. Though this film is not ironic on the whole (thank God), the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss. With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies,  Ill See You There  is a great indie-film that doesnt stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion. Aware that Bill desperately wants to see Rose, Bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first. On the way, she proceeds to hold Bill prisoner with his own gun (a Pinkerton Detective, no less). An imbroglio of angst, resentment, redemption, passion and violence ensue as Bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of Ray and Rose of course, with a few stops along the way.#1
10151_1#It has been said,  a city on hill cannot hide itself  and Virginia City, Nevada, perched on the side of Mt. Davidson at 6200 ft. west of Tahoe, is a prime example, or in the context of the movie, should be. Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver, suspiciously the same year the Civil War began. It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters; it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name  Mark Twain  and went on to become Americas most famous writer. It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune, and the launching pad of John Mackay, who became the wealthiest man in America, the third wealthiest man in the world. Hey, they should have made the movie about him! In the 1860s Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns, the home of the big bonanza, at one time the largest  metropolitan  area west of St. Louis and East of San Francisco. But Virginia City (the movie) misses all that and is more about a hogwash North/South duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott. Flynn is Capt. Kerry Bradford, a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt. Vance Irby, played by Scott. These two are always getting in each others way. Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being  snuck  out of VC by who else other than . . . Irby!  Hey, whats he doing here!?  Horrible. Bogart plays a laughable Mexican bandit who cant decide whos side hes on. Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named  Julia Hayne , obviously a historical lunge at the towns first lady, Julia Bulette, who in real life a celebrated prostitute. She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD (not Irby) from hanging and blah blah blah. Go figure. They shoulda hung the writer. In  real life  Twain reports that on the last day of the War, the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt. Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire, kind of like the movie. Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated. One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot, like theyre fishing, or trying to make the bullets go faster. Not a bad idea for the movie. The same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie. Gosh, how could they miss the gold madness, profligate wealth, gun battles in the silver mines, Mark Twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown, the crooked railroad, the Opera House fire, Artemis Ward, Bulettes huge funeral, the Chinese tongs, the black saloons, the Auction . . ? All this high on a mountain surrounded by desert? The truth was unreal. Did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great American holocaust? Well, if you count this movie, it wouldnt be the first debacle to come out of Virginia City. Its a disappointment for Virginia City fans because it misses what made the town a  city of illusions,  where it is said evil seeps out of the ground . . . Okay, other than that its a fun movie. Flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history theyre destroying. If Flynn would just play his rotten self Id double my rating.#0
1497_8#This film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film (along the lines of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). Its good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast. The movie should also be required viewing for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star!#1
3159_2#Sorry guys, Ive already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews. There are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but whats scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie. I dont like to write nasty reviews or criticise other peoples opinions but I think its only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie. This is not a good movie. I really like movies and Ill watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies I watched and was happy to leave halfway through. If you really are incredibly tempted, watch the trailerthats the mistake I made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailerafter that there are no surprises, just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias and would hate to criticise him but I think its my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this #0
1860_4#The 1998 Michael Keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for its, um, shoddy special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked up for this horror comedy theyre positively mind-boggling. The killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts. Which they probably were. The cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.#0
1351_10#Vivacious & irrepressible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unlooked-for happiness into the lives of a lonely old sister & brother on Prince Edward Island. Tom Brown most agreeably plays the schoolboy who quickly grabs Annes attention. Sara Haden is appropriately prickly as a nosy neighbor. Charley Grapewin makes the most of his few moments as Avonleas doctor.#1
9660_9#Only after some contemplation did I decide I liked this movie. And after reading comments from all the other posters here, and thinking about it some more, I decided that I liked it tremendously. I love American films - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle, and end.  Presque rien,  on the other hand, makes no such attempt. I disagree with other posters that say its too artsy. In every way, this film is meant to evoke your sense memories. So often throughout the film you feel like youre there you feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, the winter chill, the companionship, the loneliness, etc., etc. The lighting, scenery, and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - theyre rich, exquisite, and alive with detail and nuance. Although I normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot (after all, isnt a movie supposed to tell a story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.#1
8717_2#This is one of the most hilariously bad movies I have ever had the privilege to see. As a Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaurs crotch, but as ludicrous, tongue-in-cheek entertainment its a roaring success.#0
6118_1#This is not a very good telling of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff! Bo Derek in 10 was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than soft porn. If youre into that, well, then fast forward to it and skip the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show off her terrible acting. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; this was one of his few mistakes! dont waste your time on this moviego buy the book instead.#0
7427_9#I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70s when I was barely 16 while viewing another film. Oh  how excited me and my best friend were. we couldnt wait for the month or so until it would come on. I saw this movie 17 times that year at the theatre. I love,love,love it. Kris is so perfect for the film. He is brash and kinda trashy but also shy and uncertain with Babs and it is so endearing to watch it again. When they sing evergreen at the studio and he chimes in with his raspy voice so very different from the perfect notes coming from her but I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and he is so proud.I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like est-her I even have the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she wore. this came on TV on time and I got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to. Maybe its just that I was so caught up into it at an age when everything was extreme dont know. The ending always has me in tears even today.#1
11926_1#i am rarely moved to make these kind of comments BUT after sitting through most of rankins dreadful movie i feel like i have really earned the right to say what i feel about it! i couldnt actually make it right to the end, and became one of the half dozen or more walk outs (about 1/3rd of the audience) after the ragged plot, woeful dialogue and insulting characterisation became just too much to bear. this film is all pose and no art. all style and no substance. it is weighed down by dreadful acting, a genuinely dire script, indifferent cinematography and student-level production values. how it got funded, started, and finished is a mystery to me. i bet you a million quid it never goes on general release. the proper critics would tear it apart. a really bad film. shockingly bad. a really really really poor effort AND that is without even mentioning the gratuitous new-born-kitten-gets-dropped-into-a-deep-fat-fryer moment. totally meaningless, utterly lightweight, poorly put together; this movie is a dreadful embarrassment for uk cinema.#0
8419_9#The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg.It shows us Czarist General, Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his days of glory.In 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he has nothing.He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent).About ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution.His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not.The Last Command is very good silent drama.Emil Jannings does memorable role work in the lead.Evelyn Brent is wonderful playing the woman lead.William Powell is great as always.There are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie.Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent.And then there is the ending with Powell and Jannings.This is a movie that touches in many parts.#1
12155_1#If this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic, it might (i say might) have been a hit. Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults? Well this is it. Every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards. It would be hard to find another film, with this kind of production budget, that contains so little of any value whatsoever. The whole thing, from the opening scenes defies logic. Dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical. Ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself. What is really mind boggling, is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash. Wow.#0
9466_2#This movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time.  The Cat in the Hat  sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and Mike Myers performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem the books are SIMPLE. This movie is OVERBLOWN and way, way too long. You dont expect every kids movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this one set a new low. How could Mike Myers need the money?#0
1847_10#Whatever you become in your life,you must never forget that you have roots.This is the story of true facts that was made into a beautiful and moving movie! I dare to say that this movie is well underrated.This shows us a reality of lifethe more evil surrounds you ,the better person you become.Trust in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it happywithout grudges,without living  under a rock  . The movie concept is more that interestingconnecting the storytelling with real life eventskeeping us aware of everything..from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy ! See it,i recommend it to all young people.its not about racism its about how to live your life  #1
12077_8#Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense.#1
9971_10#This film was Excellent, I thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. This one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler heaven every time Kowalski floored that big block Hemi, and he sure did that a lot )#1
4694_1#I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig is comprised of several  big rig  drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people. Instead, the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide, but never do. At most, we get lost. We - the audience - end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the storytelling, end up somewhere but without direction, location, or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The storytelling is sloppy and the directors intent on  humanizing  a group of people who they regard as  overlooked  and  invisible  comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. The problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers. The directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions. Overall, the story lacks any tension, the film is entirely too long (should have been a 15 min sketch), the big question of  So what  is never answered, and the entire film is one piece of see-through propaganda that does nothing to further  enlighten  (as the directors claim) the outside world about big riggers.#0
9051_10#I was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare. My comment?  I am watching my Life!  We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country. See It #1
517_10#Pressburger and Powells greatest movie. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is AWOL and dispatches an angel to investigate. The scene when the young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, arrive in heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably poignant. Watch out too for Roger Livesey, a deeply under appreciated actor, and Kim Hunter as the love interest (later, of course, Zira in Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel (Kathleen Byron) as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in Saving Private Ryan half a century later, an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy.#1
10773_9#I would reccomend this film to everyone. Not only to the fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue, but to all film-buffs. Because its sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover, and every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Because most of the Italian debut films are lousy and this one, done by an outsider, is a real joy to watch and to listen at. Because Stefano Accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who was, like Freccia, beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin, that Ligabue shows as it is, unglamorous and ugly, without indulging in easy moralisms. Because its a film that speaks to our heart, our ears, our souls. And because I lived the experience of the FM radios and it was exactly like that. Thanks, Luciano!#1
5926_7#Sleepwalkers are creatures who drain the life force completely out of humans to survivebut they can only use virgins (its not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one such who needs to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He goes after likable Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will she escape? Fast, gory and lots of fun. If only the script were better. Also a fairly explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige was edited (you can tell) to get an R rating. I can only give this a 7.#1
6664_9#I just dont understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here. Jeez. It is mindless, it isnt polished and it is (as I am reading) wasted on some. The cast of this movie plays their characters to the T (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Ben Stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination. The problem is they dont realize their limits until the big showdown and thats the point! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel. I just dont get it. The jokes work on more then one level; if you didnt get it I know what level youre at.#1
5000_10#Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that American audiences (seemingly) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sound and smells), shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that however brilliant it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.#1
7683_10#I LOVED GOOD TIMES with the rest of many of you. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL commentary. The writers on THIS show were fantastic and the Actors were beyond TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary)What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I believe I remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it first aired and I was a tiny thingit was so sad to me..). Love, a TV LAND original sitcom junkie of the 70s and 80s (as they sing in  ALL in the Family those were the days#1
2993_4#I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror film When a terrorists body, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the US military, the corpse is then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island. Soon the infected locals turn into flesh-hungry zombies, and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead. I did not find this film to be as good as the original film, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still an OK horror film with some good action. I did not think that it was one of the best in the series. 4/10#0
7957_10#Hey guys,  Sally#1
12370_4#They probably should have called this movie The Map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are. The only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character. This of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on now , couldnt they have shown us just one of the death scenes? We hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we dont get to see anything. Some how I Bury The Living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better I movie , such as I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood.#0
3556_1#You know youre in trouble when John Cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, and  The Incubus  is a dreadful, worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills. Actually, observing the hammy script and John Houghs baroque art direction, one can hardly blame him. The movie has something to do with a series of rape-murders going on in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in. Somehow, the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene, and Cassavetes seems visibly P.O.ed at times. The Incubus itself, which doesnt show up until the last scene, is a well-done creation, but its not worth waiting for. 1/10#0
1814_1#All these reviewers are spot on. Ive seen many bad films over the years, believe me, and this beats the lot! FACT! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful. It is. Worse even than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more laughable than all of John Dereks films, this is, truly, the Citizen Kane of Trash.#0
2725_8# In Cold Blood , adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capotes famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger-man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesnt glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.#1
5558_4#I wont take too much time here, just wanted to state that Darkman 3 is awesome. I have all 3 on DVD, added these to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman ranks up there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you get the point. There isnt too many good horror, thriller, sets out there. Many thanks to the whole crew, and set for giving us the Darkman trilogy. By the way if your wondering how I came across this one on DVD. I purchased it through the internet, it is however region 4, as you know most US DVD players are region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player since it is an all region player. Just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want ( 1-9 ).#0
6208_1#There is just one word for this film. Appalling. The director clearly has talent but like his character Robert Carmichael he throws it all away. This is Crays first film. I listened to what he had to say during a Q and A session at Edinburugh and he is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety. The film is due to be released later this year, but I hope the company goes bust cos the public really dont need this kind of messed up material.#0
11227_9#Hidden Frontiers-is more than fan fiction- it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of Star Trek alive and growing. From a fun little fan project to now a well known net series; Hidden Frontiers has a bit of something for every star trek fan in it. Set in the Late Star Trek Next Generation/DS9 and Voyager time lines Hidden Frontier takes on topics and issues raised in other Star Trek series with set stories using a well developed characters, plots, and story arcs. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken on social context stories that Gene Roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long term space assignments - the real things that happen in close quarters as well as an exciting spatial wars and conflicts Sci-Fi addicts know and love. Done in a  Green Screen  studio; Hidden Frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts. The large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. Inventive use of green screen technology, props, makes up and costumes work to make the Hidden Frontier worlds of Star Trek fun and believable. Hidden Frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction, and thrived once they got there. Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat. I highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch.#1
2660_10#When i first went to watch The Shining I was expecting a decent film from what I had heard about it and I liked a lot of Stanley Kubricks other work but when I started to watch it it was so much better than I thought it would be.At times I seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and I couldnt take my eyes of the screen still theres something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now some people dont like Kubricks version of The Shining since it doesnt entirely follow Stephen Kings book but in my opinion both Kubricks version,the mini-series and the book are all great.Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance.If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch The Shining.#1
4938_7#Panic In The Streets opens in high noir style, a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window, behind which is playing out a sleazy card game - an opening flourish which, along with some of the location shooting, anticipates some of the atmosphere Welles brought a decade later in Touch Of Evil. One of the players throws open the window; its an appropriate action, serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld. Occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer. Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup. Perhaps just as astonishingly, he never inoculates himself - inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises. At the end of the film, too, the potential epidemic has been halted, all contactees located, a little too neatly. But these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today.#1
8910_3#This film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot. The entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends (including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner another girl thats right theyre lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason). Unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through. Also unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. Where exactly were they? Where did the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit? The acting is terrible I think but its hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it. I give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it wasnt quite bad enough to be funny.#0
6060_10#This is a great documentary film. Any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film. Director  Stephen Low  did a great job,as well as the main stars of the film, Father & Son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks & sounds amazing. And best of all its IMAX! Great home theater test disc.#1
8849_9#The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently has his act together) and Hank (clearly doesnt have his act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family. Theres really not much wrong with this film. It jumps back and forth without being confusing. Events spiral out of control, but the film never does - the writing (from first timer Kelly Masterson), directing (veteran Sidney Lumet) and the editing stay as tight as a drum. In many categories, this is award caliber stuff, though maybe films like The Departed and No Country squeezed this one out of the limelight. If you liked those, youll like this.#1
4790_1#I loathed this film. The original Phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery. Like many 70s horror flicks, it looked and felt like some creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80s, pumped up the action, but maintained this nice attention to mood. Sadly, Phantasm III is just awful. It tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films, which diminishes rather than expands their power. It shamelessly degrades imagery from the first Phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the draft. Didnt anyone-- the prop master, the DP, the editor, the director-- notice or care that they looked so crummy? Even worse, Phantasm III presents one corny, unfunny joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first film. The original Phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about Reggies horniness several refer to the films  flying balls  ha-ha, oh, I get it, balls. Maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes, but they are on us.#0
8991_2#I bought this DVD after seeing it highly ranked here. Its just a short 20 minutes zombie film. Nothing special about it except for the music perhaps. Dont buy it! Not even really worth spending 20 minutes to see it. Only if youre really bored#0
9902_3#A very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub-genre. The plot a simply a collection of cliches and set-pieces that weve all seen a hundred times before. Has great potential as an insomnia treatment.#0
6918_10#A very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over. The cast is very good, theres plenty of action, and Stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with a twist) in the end. Ive seen this film several times, and always watch when its on AMC or cable. Highly recommended#1
3894_3#The Incredible Melting Man plays like an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know this film is a bit crummy but I found it impossible not to kind of like it. This film is just too 70s for me to hate it. Its tacky and trashy but I thought it was a lot of fun. You could do a lot worse.#0
3267_8#Yes, Im sentimental & schmaltzy  But this movie (and its theme song) remain one of my all time greats  Robert Downey Jr. does such justice to the role of  Louis Jeffries  reincarnated and the storyline (although far-fetched) is romantic & makes one believe in happy endings #1
10426_9#I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their  real  lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not quite important after all. You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. I am on a journey too. The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.#1
7651_8#An interesting TV movie based on true fact, betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brothers death penalty. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem starts. It has nothing to do with Koteas acting ability. He just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to  G.Q.  magazine, with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me after meeting again an old friend, whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, which he spent in several Panamanian jails. The young man I used to know is gone, not only because he is older, but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system. There are jails and there are jails, one must say, but this one prisoner in  Shot In the Heart  is definitely out of this world.#1
5727_9#Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, Emma (Grace Zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Maki), disappears. Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emmas home, and she attempts to  see how deep the rabbit hole goes . Now that Ive said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant Its not that Im anti-remake, but it is ridiculous that U.S. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. The original versions of these films should just be playing in U.S. theaters in wide release. There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for non-white or foreign actors. Yes, The Grudge is a fine film, but ultimately, Id rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just Japanese, but also Indian, Spanish, Chinese, etc.--at my multiplex. In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.#1
12030_9#hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) i Love the film Twisted Desire, And i love watching Melissa Joan Hart on the t.v as i think she is fine. I am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too, so this helped my watch it (dont ask). i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully, as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles, so she wont give away her fingerprints (a very well planned out idea), back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. i give this film a nine out of ten, and put it in MY top 10 films list. And last but not least if anyone sees this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didnt record it. bye#1
996_9#This movie surprised me. Some things were  clicheish  and some technological elements reminded me of the movie  Enemy of the State  starring Will Smith. But for the most part very entertaining- good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief). This is a movie you can watch over again-say some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value.#1
9344_1#As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists. Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth.#0
3155_1#Great movie - especially the music - Etta James -  At Last . This speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone.#0
542_9#When I first found out that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to realize that Ive seen the original of this and loved it. So I had even more reason to watch. Well, I watched. It was actually better than most sequels for TV movies. I hate what happens to Brians character (you can find out for yourself) and I didnt like most of the characters, Brians one included. But the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine once more. At the end, I was cheering for Stanley and his own happy ending. If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake or if you like horror movies without the blood, Id suggest you watch this.#1
195_8# Show People  is an absolutely delightful silent directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying to make it on the big screen. Though shes a success in comedy, what she wants to do is make  art  so she moves up to High Arts Studio. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend Billy.  Show People  is a simple story told in a witty way. Its also a look back at an exciting era in Hollywoods history and contains performances by two wonderful stars.#1
4766_1#you can tell they spent 5$ making this.it is a waste of your time ugh.. there is not anything remotely good about this movie .. i dont know why i kept watching it.. the chick is not hot. horrid acting.. you could do anything and its a better use of your time.. like watching TV playing shitty video games.. i feel robbed. simply robbed.. of my time . i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on IMDb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments. -there was no action- -no hot chicks- -no budget- -shittttttttttttttty acting- it screams bad movie.     the WHOLE movie is in a room.   #0
10989_2# Warning - no plot spoilers ahead, but movie spoilers nonetheless  My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast. Wow - very, very wrong. This movie is an overdone, overwrought, and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot! The copyright date on the box said 2005, yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s, and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos. It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback, and therefore supposed to look old, but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up, and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences (yet its a different, much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks). I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences, shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up (and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes). Thus, this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old, re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time. The shell story, shot in 2005, is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead (something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60s to his girl that they would meet on the  fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005?) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful, overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie. Dont bother. Theres a reason why youve never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - its terrible.#0
4237_3#JUDAAI was a bold film by Raj Kanwar at its time In 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the box Anil does his part well Sridevi is excellent in her part Urmila is decent Amongst rest Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh irritates Farida is decent#0
11553_9#Theres more to offer in the opening of The Odd Couple than in the entirety of most films. Felix Unger (the poor guys monogram even curses him) checks into a New York hotel. A cleaning lady says  Good night.   Goodbye,  he answers back. In his room he empties his pockets, then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope, addressed to his wife and beloved children. When the viewer finally puts it together  aha, hes going to off himself  we watch him struggle to open the window  oh no, hes going to jump  The poor guy injures his lower back. This is all you need to know about Felix Unger  his wife has left him, hes a compulsive cleaner and hes a hypochondriac. And all in one scene. This is the particular genius of Neil Simons comedy  its about situation and character. There are few obvious physical jokes  no kicks to the groin, no cheap gags  just funny characters in uncomfortable situations. And, of course, he is a master of manipulating the audiences expectations. Coming from the Swingers era, imagine what I thought in the date scene when Felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate Oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment. Hes blowing it, right? Think again. The girls love his sensitivity, his ability to cry in front of them. They invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because Oscar wasnt paying enough attention to it. Hes in like Flynn, right? Uh, yes, but he doesnt want to go with the girls because hes feeling vulnerable. Great stuff. And its made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight-room apartment set. Youve got Jack Lemmon and the slouchy, pouchy Walter Matthau for Chrissakes, why mess it up? The visual style reminded me of Breakfast at Tiffanys, in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action. Particularly memorable is the scene in which Felix, fleeing from Oscar, closes a partition only to realize the partition doesnt cover the side where Oscar is coming from. You get a real sense of the layout of the apartment, and thus the proximity in which the two divorcées live. The twist here is that these two are really married  to each other. So the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys.#1
3810_4#When I was younger, I liked this show, but nowBLECCH  This show is sappy, badly written, and rarely funny. The three leads were all good actors and funny men (Sagets stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with, as was Coulier a better stand up, and Stamos was a better than average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff (who could blame him?). The show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money. Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved since I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just so sugary sweet, I couldnt stand it after a while.#0
9767_7#Oh, boy, God bless the 1970s, we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade The Exorcist, Jaws, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and now, Raggedy Ann & Andy A Musical Adventure. This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, I mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me. My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money. What the heck? Its kinda funny how this movie is the 1970s version of Toy Story, pretty much down to a key, only this was a thousand times scarier, Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children. 7/10#1
8067_8#Today if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen the response most likely will be  Who?  or perhaps  Why?  Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film, which is about a poor, desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for  carfare  to the United States. Its an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well-meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks. The movie takes place in British-dominated Ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland, all Mr. McLaglens character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk. The movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, they dont even know what the fuss is all about. The morale of this movie is look out for the friend, he may sell you out for a dime.#1
10963_1#I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment.Once I realized I would not be getting that,I watched it for a pretty well made movie (in terms of filming,and yeah..that was it).But aside from it having a good film quality,considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long,there was nothing good about that movie. Poor Mr.Carroll.Im so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales.#0
11783_1#What a crappy movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug. No-talent-what-so-ever-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script?! Was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record-button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along? Is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what? My friends younger brother is in the 6.th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur-movie for their school-project which outdid this geeky movie.. This is by far the worst film I have seen in my life! There is just no excuse for this flick!#0
11245_2#I entered the theater to Sky Captain in 2004 expecting a good film. Nearly every review of this movie had been positive, the effects looked enticing, the previews convincing. The film wasnt the worst movie out there, which is why I didnt give it a 1. Rather, the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects, but without artistic vision or originality of any kind, it falls flat.#0
5801_1#Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. He travels to this small town where its said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. I really hate Christian films. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid storyline and minimal effects. Not to mention that this isnt just a Christian filmbut a foreign one as well. The voice-over actor for Ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing, because it is so high pitched and whiny. You wont miss much by missing out on this film.#0
11739_8# Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark  is a sort of  Harper Valley P.T.A.  with touches of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new stations owner gets fresh with her. Shes now relying on a Las Vegas show to carry her through, but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started. Things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunts death, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts for the reading of the will. A house in need of repairs, a dog, and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt, and again it seems Elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the Las Vegas show. The adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for Elvira. Only the local hunk (Daniel Greene), and a group of teenagers will befriend her. Elviras Uncle  Vinnie  (W. Morgan Sheppard), presses to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting, and a couple very effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power. Elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the towns old charge of witchcraft, and the showdown between her and her uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace.  Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark  is full of cute, gross, bawdy, and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags, puns, props, songs, and parodies. The films touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers; including Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conaway (of  Grease. ) There are also nice special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if the Elvira character could carry a feature film, and the answer is delightfully, YES #1
12066_2#OK, hows this for original- this mean, rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children, all of them ungrateful losers, and two creepy servants, provided they spend the week in his spooky old house. What happens that night will surprise only those who havent seen a movie or television show before. After a string of murders in which the victims look like theyre bleeding restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious twist ending. The cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks. There are also a few second-tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of  Matlock.  I will give credit where its due- the closing scene is clever and amusing, if youre still awake.#0
9790_9#Although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film, the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb. Noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious, the dead-on acting by the minor characters, and the interesting decision to represent Talia only as a teenager. I will quibble with Yaaras final declaration as stands with Gadi, Talias last boyfriend, at a cliffs edge, but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled.#1
2393_2#I read Tom Robbins EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under  GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS.  (Thats the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one. This movie is sour and dull. And I accuse YOU, Gus Van Sant #0
1029_3#My dad is a fan of Columbo and I had always disliked the show. I always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he goes on watching it none the less. That is his right as an American I guess. But my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that Spielberg had directed the premier episode. It was then that I was thankful that my dad had bought this show that I really cant stand. I went through his DVD collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college. My opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed, but I did gain respect for Spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors. And that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along (get the pun, HA,HA. Like Spielberg did. Its like Jesus before he became a man. Or thats at least what I think that would feel like. Any ways if your fan of Columbo than you would most likely like this, even though it contains little of Peter Falk. I attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet. This episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of Columbos investigation, as many later episodes would do.#0
9425_1#Did anyone edit this film? Or was it only the DVD release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes? Its OK though, I fell asleep watching it the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is actually not the worst Ive seen, but its close. The acting is not the worst Ive seen eitherbut its close. The production . well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I had ever seen in my life! Not trying to be spiteful, but Unhinged could have used some more production. 1/10#0
6014_8#All of the reviews here about how much ZP lacks plot, the acting is wooden, the orgy scene makes no sense, etc., all miss the main point. If you insist on watching it not intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyds wonderful re-working of  Careful With That Axe, Eugene,   Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up.  #1
2258_7#I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort of Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film to show South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a movie about education and a teachers relationship with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore. I watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand. Now while I dont know the other actors and actresses in the film, I assume that they are very popular in South Africa and I am glad that they filmed with a South African cast and crew with the exception of Goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie, than Whoopi reaches worldwide appeal.#1
12459_10#This movie is definately one of my favourite movies in its kind. The interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen. It treats themes like duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like few films have done and, unfortunately, none that I can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious, down to the essential, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. No such scenes are present or needed. The argument is flowless and honest to the spectator, wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience. No, this is not miss Marble A note of congratulations for the music is in order A film to watch and savour every minute, not just to see.#1
2093_7#This is a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes) but it had a a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, a lot of ground to cover. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day and they dont disappoint here, both giving powerful performances. The only problem is credibility as all the Asians are played by Caucasions and some of them, like Walter Connolly, just dont look real. Id like to see a re-make of this movie with all-Asian actors, not for PC reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible.#1
7714_10#There were a lot of 50s sci-fi movies. They were big draws for the Drive-in theaters. A lot of them were crappy even back then. This movie and The Day the Earth Stood Still stand out, and both have aged well in their own way. From the very beginning with its eerie theremin musical score (which still sounds weird since theremins are hardly ever used) Forbidden Planet takes you where no man has gone before. Speaking of Star Trek theres so much material in this film that got into Star Trek TOS its like a pilot for the series; from the interactive captain/first mate/doctor, the mad scientist, alien beings, babe in short skirt, computer intelligence; it is all de rigeur now but this was the first of its kind. Besides, it has good acting and well-done artwork which even today evokes a certain awe at the imagery. Consider how the huge Krell machine is successfully depicted with some real depth. I saw this as a kid (at a drive-in 0)when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course every movie that was even vaguely scary did back then but I remember being real worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie a sci-fi fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing.#1
3266_1#When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has run off with his own brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to unload his tale of woe--only to discover that Norman has a secret lover the effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not take it well, and numerous complications follow--including Bens attempt to get Norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker (Tammy Dobson.) Unfortunately, this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer#0
12050_10#Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies. They get to be same ol-same ol. Same ol pack every minute with some cheap thrill (usually splatter) and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects. One of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience. For instance, I saw both of the recent Mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second. It probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended, it grew roots. Closest thing I have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen and its a terrible shame that this is out of print. I just paid over $40 for my second copy of this movie. Its a major prize in my collection. Now Im on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama.#1
6509_4#Sean Bean is great, as are the photography, locations and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat muddled, and the conclusion flat. The plot has been SUBSTANTIALLY altered from Cornwells novel, and not to the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watched. Sharpe was too narrowly drawn here, in contrast with his literary alter ego, who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks. I really enjoyed the brief scene in which Sharpe is tripped by a  real  officer, and after a quick pause and piercing stare, pushes the surprised and cowed officer right back. It sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer. Rating  4  of  10.  #0
7202_1#Since I had loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the 80s, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. Also, the movie could not keep me interested for long. I was glad it was over. If you want to see Inspector Gadget, watch the cartoon instead. It was much better than the movie.#0
11615_2#Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of Joshua. Heck, I wasnt even aware he was in Joshua until I started the movie. So it goes without saying, I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie, not the leads. A sort of Rosemarys Baby, The Omen or any other demonic kid movie Joshua was billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. Yet, I continued on to see how this would all resolve, hoping beyond belief, the ending climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay, I admit, it did (a wee bit) but what a stale closing. And what a low-low budget movie, or at least thats how they designed it. A person falls  you dont see the drop, you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood. A person gets hit by a cab  you dont see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike up. Im not sure if this is called  style  or laziness or simply, lack of funds for special effects. We have a  rich  family with a crazy mom, a workaholic father attempting to balance everything, a kid  Joshua, who may/may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days shes alive  and what was that about? Are there rats above or is it Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family? Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does he drive his family to the brink? I dont think so. They were nuts prior, and no  so-called  acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, barely any questions were answered, barely any open doors shut. Im sure that might have been the idea, but for Petes sake, give me something. Anything. There are plenty better kid-gone-wild movies to explore. Joshuas more like the Mini-Me of the antichrist.#0
761_1#Absolute garbage. The reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic.  All the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it. But surely a genius like Lt C, by constant conversation with the wronged husband, would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.#0
8721_10#Disney (and the wonderful folks at PIXAR of course) offer a nice, humourous story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that maybe the faces of the bugs were a little more static than in Antz and they only had four legs (in Antz six). But backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking. But let this be a lesson it was not the computer who made it such a success  it was the man behind the machine, who added the nice little twists, which I missed in Antz. Some highlights were of course the bloopers at the end (So keep watching at the end, its worth it!), which were highly amusing and original. The line Filmed entirely on location was intended for the more attentive viewer.#1
8976_7#Starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the World War II years. When youve got such stars as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, and Randolph Scott, etc., in the film and with such people as the Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn supplying the music, its an easy to take film. And the plot isnt even in the way. This is the oldest of clichés when you say they dont make them like this any more, but they really dont because you dont have a studio system that has all this talent under contract. Thats one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn.#1
8254_1#Ive seen better production quality on YouTube! I pity the actors, as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking, not sure how they could get the lines out - I really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much. Its a shame really, as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality, direction and script it could have been a decent movie. It certainly was not a comedy, unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded weird.#0
8365_8#Yep, you read that right, kids. Michael Bay shouldve studied this film before making either of his over hyped, overlong, overly pointless  Transformers  movies.  Robot Jox  is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the  Transformers  crew spent on Megan Foxs personal trainer. I hope Im not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction, because it isnt.  Robot Jox  is just plain fun. Ill grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average B-grade sci-fi movie, and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known (especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery), it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the Empire/Full Moon Pictures factory. The robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion/model techniques, and the sets and costumes dont look half-assed in the slightest. Empire Pictures and director Stuart ( Re-Animator ) Gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture. Unfortunately it didnt quite pan out for them (or the studio) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal. Bottom line if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2+ hours, feel free to rent a  Transformers  movie. By the end youre likely to feel like youve spent all that time watching someone else play a video game. If you want to have a rockem, sockem robot good time, pick up Robot Jox instead.#1
10593_4#The infamous Ed Wood  classic  Plan 9 From Outer Space features an indignant alien calling the human race,  stupid! Stupid, stupid stupid!  Id have to say exhibit A in that trial would probably this movie, a ridiculously silly sci-fi film. While its no Plan 9, USTR is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy Van Damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths. Not to be seen on a serious stomach.#0
10235_2#The only reason I give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on. This film is asinine. Its like so many other 21st century grind house fodder. The gore is gratuitous and simply revolting. I didnt care about any of the characters, but I did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap Id complain about the money I spent, but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining  Live Free or Die Hard,  which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the utter poop of  Captivity  for 40 minutes.#0
11650_1#After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. Though i guess not. If the first one wasnt bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. Though they couldnt, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. Though the thing is i didnt laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. Most of the time its just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that its hard to watch it and enjoy it. Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that its supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably arent one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It doesnt take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs. Its a movie parody thats actually good and well done and it didnt have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.#0
9998_9#Seeing as the vote average was pretty low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was  just OK , I didnt have much expectations when renting this film. Very recommended.#1
7081_8#The story of this film is truly remarkable. A virus cut loose and only 1% of the human race survived. The only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say,  The Twelve Monkeys did it.  Thats right, the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 Billion people. Apparently animals do not contract this disease. Day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it. All they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them, the deaths began during 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (Or at least thats what the poster says.) So a current convict named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent as a  volunteer  to get some samples from above. After he does his  volunteer  work, he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world. Cole accepts and the story of the Twelve Monkeys begin. For the whole acting of the film, I give it a A+. Bruce Willis is great for this role and he acts good, but Brad Pitt is completely 100% excellent. His acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. I never really cared for Brad Pitt in till I saw him in this and Fight Club. There characters or similar in this film, he is just a little more insane in this film. So overall I think this film is completely worth checking out. For most people its a great science fiction film, I just dont think it is a masterpiece.#1
26_3#Assuming this wont end up a straight-to-video release, I would have to say void this title at all costs. Unless youre bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didnt care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the directorthat is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are firedand then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. Lets just say this is only an indicator of things to comeunfortunately. 3/10#0
857_1#Many King fans hate this because it departed from the book, but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump. That notwithstanding, the movie does fail completely, but it fails entirely on film terms. Id like to smack the people who tell me its the scariest movie ever made. I always follow up with the question  Really exactly what scene scared you?  Every fan Ive asked, goes silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent scare (There are none), names the  Grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators  shtick. If youre afraid of that, I dont know what to tell you, except maybe that youre easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky, incoherent movie. Toss in the grotesque overacting of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of dumb one-liners at tense moments, and the Razzie nominated performance of Shelly Duvall and you have a very crappy movie.#0
719_4#This film, though ostensibly a comedy, is deadly serious. Its subject is Imperialism (with a capital I) how Britain, foolishly, humiliatingly, tries to convince itself that its still a great power after World War II. At home, the Empire is run by amiable dolts, benevolent Tories who are so in-bred that they cant distinguish close relatives; the Offices of Government consist of long forgotten archives (a dig at Orwellian paranoia?), inhabited by indolent rats, and ante-rooms wherein lounge bored synacures, reading popular novels. None of the Boultings farces have dated well - theyre never thought through enough. Although Carlton-Browne revels in the decline of the Empire, it also seems to be anti-democratic and militaristic. Im sure this wasnt intended, but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form.#0
519_10#I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it. Its beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time. Its difficult to believe this was made in 1946, as the tale is still fresh today, and really makes one think. Im not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made. In addition, the acting is superb, and the use of English and American actors quite astounding. I recently purchased the DVD so now Im able to watch whenever I wish. I highly recommend anyone interested in post-war British films to watch this.#1
3632_4#N.B. Spoilers within. Assigning an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that directors mind. But directing a Wagner opera is an especially tricky task, as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold. Hans-Jurgen Syberberg loads this filming of  Parsifal,  Wagners final masterpiece, with enough extraneous ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the seams. You get more than a piece of the director you get the whole fatted hog and then some. Syberberg is to be admired for his penchant for tearing back the covers on the uglier aspects of German history. But does it work to meld that desire to a Wagner opera already brimming with its own concepts?  The Monte Carlo Philharmonic under Armin Jordan plays with passion and beauty (though the chorus is disappointing). But after watching this film I only wanted to whip out my Solti-led recording (HIGHLY recommended) and get my Wagnerian bearings straight again. The film experience for me ranged from bizarre to entertaining to infuriating. To Syberbergs credit, hes created a visually arresting work, and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera. But instead of sticking to  Parsifal,  he seems to have wanted to bring in all things Wagnerian the man, the life, the enormous influenceall of it in crude symbolic code.  Parsifal  the opera is already full of weighty symbolism the Grail, the Spear, the Holy Sacraments, baptism, Amfortass ever-bleeding wound, Klingsors self-castration, the Kiss, Kundrys Curse, and on and on. This is not to mention the  musical  symbolism sounding constantly in the score, in the form of Wagners leitmotif system.  Parsifal  itself is one huge symbol! Getting back to my first-paragraph question, Syberbergs whole hog is all way too much for me. But if this project sounds like something to tickle your fancy, then go for it. I wont recommend just staying away from this; you may find yourself heartily satisfied. Or if you need something to crack your Wagner barrier, try itbut please, please, dont stop here.  Parsifal  is in a late, very ripe league of its own.#0
1140_3#Scary, but mostly in the sense that will it be over before I turn 70. I saw this as a late night re-run in about 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, its better than nothing (but just). Its a sort of Roy Rogers version of Rosemarys Baby. This is one turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and its 130 on Saturday morning and theres nothing on but replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, then I guess it beats that. But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.#0
1949_1#The animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures rather than characters. Ive been a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the series premiered in 1969. I didnt think much of the Scooby Doo animated movies, (Im talking about the TV Series, not the full length movies.), but some of them were pretty cool, and I like most people found Scrappy Doo to be an irritant, but this series is pure garbage. As soon as I saw the animation, and heard the characters, (and I use that term loosely) speak, I cringed. Also, Mystery Inc., was a team, and without the entire crew to compliment each other, it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones, and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants. Whats New Scooby Doo was better than this. If youre going to have a Scooby Doo TV series, include the elements that made the series endure so long. The entire cast of characters, and quality animation. They need to put this one back under the rock from where it came.#0
12134_8#I happen to like Leslie Howard, in his better films. Yet, for some reason, his performance in OF HUMAN BONDAGE never has moved me tremendously. I first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s Howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by Dirk Bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed. This is not usually the case (off hand I think of Ashley Wilkes as a man who might be betrayed, if he and Scarlett OHara were meant to be an item by Margaret Mitchell - but Ashley loved Melonie, not Scarlett). Howard could play any type, and a role like R. J. Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins is not one who is betrayed.  Curiously her performance was not all of one note. While she uses and abuses Howard for two thirds of the film, culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her, her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating, and her inability to keep any honest jobs. When Howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes (he asks what happened to her baby - she tells him the baby died and Howard says brusquely that he is glad, which is hardly the response she expects). In the end Howard does finally get his life in order, but Mildred ends a casualty (ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend Denny on a medical call). The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences did fail to nominate Davis in 1934 (leading to the largest write - in campaign in its history, and a permanent change in its rules), but Davis was established as a star. In one year she won the Oscar as Joyce Heth in DANGEROUS. And in two years she co-starred with Howard again (as equal stars) in THE PETRIFIED FORREST.#1
8015_10#I first saw this movie in the theater when I was 8 years old and it still cracks me up. The Muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way. My favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit at a fancy restaurant. This is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents alike. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.#1
9046_8#I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, Ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, hell crack an Oscar one day Sure, its a basic family movie, but thats a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs.#1
5414_10#This happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler, based rather loosely on Rudyard Kiplings memorable poem as well as his novel  Soldiers Three,  qualifies as first-rate entertainment about the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together. Set in faraway India, this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged British sergeants and their native water bearer Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of  The Last Outpost ), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaglen of  The Informer ), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of  The Dawn Patrol ), are a competitive trio of hard-drinking, hard-brawling, and fun-loving Alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesney drum up assorted schemes to derail Ballentines plans. When their superiors order them back into action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of  The Sheik Steps Out ), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography.#1
7937_2#After 30 seconds, you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock-off. The story is taken from great movies like  Texas Chainsaw Massacre  and  Hills have Eyes . I like those kind of movies, even if theyre duplicated well (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver).  But  Side Sho  is hard to watch the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced. You do not care at all what happens to the characters. The so-called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical. So how about the blood and gore ? Well there is some, although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly. 2 Points, just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look, even for the gore-hounds..#0
10571_1#my wife is a fanatic as regards this show. That being the case I bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order. I personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire to name a few, the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals. Ive seen better special effects in the old Republic Pictures serials I saw as a child. I can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though I dont know if it was their own choosing or not. Please. please dont renew for another season as enough is enough, Bob#0
1373_2#This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? Well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques. Absolutely priceless.#0
2143_9#It is not the same as the other films about dancing. A few normal people found themselves from dancing. Unlike the dancing films in Hollywood, the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people. They are someone that you may see everyday in your offices. They are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing. This touches me very deeply.#1
4559_1#Im surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility. The script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers Union (and thats saying something!). Get out your binoculars if you want, but theres nothing resembling a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish. The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability Im amazed it lasted past the first episode - correction, past the auditions. All I can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained. And its obvious that the production costs must have been all of ₤100 per episode. And just in case anyone thinks Im commenting as a foreigner who is unfamiliar with English humour, I must add that I am indeed English.#0
6468_7#This is a pretty OK film yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient, and the movie doesnt really justify the large star cast (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor that really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he first meets Amitabhs character, I thought that a man who can just look at AB, keep staring and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he has proved himself worthy again in Sarkar, alongside AB for a second time. This guy should get more roles, hes brilliant. An interesting watch, considering its Bollywood, although a bit inspired by Hollywood oldies like  the Great Escape  and  Bridge on the River Kwai .#1
136_10#This movie is a great way for the series to finally end. Peter (the boy from Puppet Master III) is all grown up and is now the Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn Toulons secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets. Most of this movie is footage from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master, and Retro Puppet Master (sorry But I guess Paramount wouldnt let them use scenes from 1). Personally I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say  This is THE final movie in the series  #1
5389_7#Sort of like a very primitive episode of  General Hospital  set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so palpably a wreck, and with such good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young, as always, doesnt do anything to disinvite audience sympathy, and shes a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and lovely to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels right. Aline MacMahon,  one of the cinemas few perfect actresses,  in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, gets to croon  Frankie and Johnny  as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. Its scaled and paced modestly, and Lindens expectant-dad panic stays with you for days -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, but hes a terrified young kid in trouble, and very persuasive.#1

9822_10#I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years. Its not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, its about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most important. Its not a sin to have a child when youre a teenager and still in high school, and its not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this great movie, and if they did, they clearly didnt get the message behind it all. Its about not taking chances when youre in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. Its not a myth. You dont necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first. This movie has a clear message behind it JUST SAY NO!#1
1826_3#i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it. in a word, it is unfunny. UNfunny. i totally believe the trivia tidbit about jack black apologizing for making this garbage. i cant believe that barry levinson didnt just toss this script when he read the first page. moreover, i cant believe that i watched more than ten minutes of it. i gave it 3 out of 10  because i love to see christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck. also, the horse  corky,  by merely existing as a character in this movie, is actually quite ridiculous.#0
7474_9#This is one of those movies thats difficult to review without giving away the plot. Suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on, beyond the initial superficial  Tom Cruise screws around with multiple women  plot. 9/10#1
5412_2#Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Maliks music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the film if possible.#0
12329_1#Back in my days as an usher  Private Lessons  played at the 4-plex I was working. It was a sleeper hit selling out Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend, so I decided to give it a shot. What I witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch. I will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982. Certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office. And to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country. THAT is a scary thought.#0
2666_10#Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. Its better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, its better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, its better), I dont care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.  Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesnt suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the mens room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? Its one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, thats just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubricks movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.#1
95_3#You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you dont particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and Im as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.#0
6930_8#This is quite an unusual and unique little western, that is made mostly original due to its story that revolves around an unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all of those who get to poses it at one point or another in the movie. 8/10#1
10934_10#After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth. The story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his  unfinished  pupil out to find the 5 past members of his Poison Clan, so they do not seek out a fortune which the masters friend keeps hidden. Afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training, he instructs him to befriend one of the five  venoms  so as to defeat the other four. I cant say enough about the choreography or the camera work. A fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made. A CLASSIC #1
2719_10#I saw this film after watching Capote and Infamous. It is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie. The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay. Fascinating film.#1

1100_3#Since most reviews of this film are of screenings seen decades ago Id like to add a more recent one, the film opens with stock footage of B-17s bombing Germany, the film cuts to Oskar Werners Hauptmann (captain) Wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to Hitlers Fuehrer Bunker, once inside, they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel, the film then cuts to one of many conference scenes with Albin Skoda giving a decent impression of Adolf Hitler rallying his officers to  Ultimate Victory  while Werners character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizens are caught up in a fantasy world-some non-bunker events are depicted, most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a Russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the Flak units and his familys difficulty in surviving-this film suffers from a number of detail inaccuracies that a German film made only 10 years after WW2 should not have included; the actor portraying Goebbels (Willy Krause) wears the same uniform as Hitler, including arm eagle- Goebbels wore a brown Nazi Party uniform with swastika armband-the  SS  soldiers wear German army camouflage, the well documented scene of Hitler awarding the iron cross to boys of the Hitler Youth is shown as having taken place INSIDE the bunker (it was done outside in the courtyard) and lastly, Hitlers suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian browning model 1922-most accounts agree it was a Walther PPK-some bits of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable, this bit is shown as a cabaret skit, with a intoxicated wounded soldier (his arm in a splint) maniacally goose-stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease/belly dance, all by candlelight this is actually embarrassing to watch-the most incredible bit is when Werners Captain Wust gains an audience alone with Skodas Hitler, Hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench, drugged and delirious, when Werners character begins to question him, Hitler starts screaming which brings in a SS guard who mortally wounds Werners character in the back with a gunshot-this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account-Werners character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while Hitler prepares his own ending, Hitlers farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off-screen, the final seconds of the movie show Hitlers funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead Oskar Werner/Hauptmann Wust-this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent films such as the 1973 remake  Hitler the last 10 days  or the German film  Downfall  (Der Untergang) if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story, these last two films are based on first person eyewitness accounts, with  Hitler the last 10 days  being compiled from Gerhard Boldts autobiography as a staff officer in the Fuehrer Bunker and  Downfall  being done from Hitlers secretarys recollections, the screen play for  Der Letzte Akte  is taken from American Nuremberg war crimes trial judge Michael Musmannos book  Ten days to die , which is more a compilation of events (many obviously fanciful) than eyewitness history-it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Ropers account, The last days of Hitler  was never made into a film.#0
1635_3#I see quite a few positive reviews on this board, trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following. I see the usual ranting-- I guess this movie is just not for the easily offended,   This movie is not Shakespeare,  etc. Guess what? Neither was  Road Trip   And I laughed my a   off during that movie! Theres a way to make a crude, tasteless comedy and deliver laughs; and theres a way tojust make it crude and tasteless.  Whipped  tries to be  Swingers  without the wit or intelligence. It seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14-year-old boy. For Gods sake, the characters in this movie are supposed to be white-collar, upright citizens--and they talk like some of the idiots I knew in freshman year of high school! The dialogue is laced--more like drowned--with four-letter words. You would think that people of their status would have SOME degree of intelligence--and a more extensive vocabulary. Just watch a Whit Stillman film and youll see the difference. Not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish. If you know any successful, white-collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie--please let me know and introduce me to them. Their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty. There is absolutely NO insight into relationships, sex oranything  Its just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely--and dont take the word  extremely  for granted, because I mean it with all my heart--crude gags. These are gags with no substance. Gags that are meant more for groans than laughs. The scene at the end between Amanda Peet and her girlfriends was totally un-called for and totally unconvincing. There are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by (straight) men and play out wonderfully. This scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures. It involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a womans mouth. It was one of those noticeably-written-by-a-guy scenes. I wasnt believing it for a second.   Whipped  is purely a sick male fantasy thats as flat as it is annoying. I got (very) few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy, and those were probably a result of desperation. When youre not laughing for a long period of time, you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things. So I wouldnt mark that down as a positive.#0
9011_4#Pretty standard B-movie stuff. Seriously, anyone who watches  Dragon Fighter  with Dean Cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist to re-work formulas that are popular. If you give them even token analysis, youll wind up ruining the movie for yourself (and perhaps writing some self-important, slanderous review on IMDb). I liked the female lead, Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I thought she was notably attractive. It was a memorable B-movie appearance. Unfortunately, I dont see where she has made any movies since. Ill watch for her again.#0
2164_2#I thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including Peter OToole, Susannah York, Michael Craig & Harry Andrews might be worth watching. Alas, I was wrong. Utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both OToole and York overacting wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. Ive a feeling OToole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (York). He is also barking mad. But apart from that, your guess is as good as mine. The film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. I can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. Risible.#0
8178_1#Have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before? That happened to me with  The Young Graduates . The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is extremely deceiving. Id swear that the two women on the cover arent even in the film. Theres a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing. Our cat, BooBoo, was transfixed by the dancing high school kids. She watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor. Its nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10#0
6202_1#I did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though I felt so angry at what I saw. I felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I have lived in the UK I have come to love this country but this film depicts British young people in the worst way imaginable. There is nothing to be said but avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. The people involved should be ashamed.#0
9491_1#This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. Its exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However, what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come on, sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film, well, not a proper one at least.#0
10500_4#I never was an avid viewer of  Crocodile Hunter , but did occasionally see an episode, or a bit of an episode, and when the news spread about Steve Irwins death from a stingray attack in 2006, it certainly caught my attention. This movie, with Steve and his wife, Terri, playing themselves, but in a fictional story, was released in 2002, but I didnt hear of it until several years later, and even after that, it took me a while to get around to seeing it. Well, now I have seen it, and after looking here first (more than once), and seeing its rating, I was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be, though it could have been a BIT better. Apparently, its supposed to be a comedy, so a major problem with it is that it isnt very funny at all. Steve Irwin was admired by many as a conservationist, and is sadly missed by them, while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him. No matter which side youre on,  The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course  is not a well crafted movie. Im sure it does help if youre a big Steve Irwin fan, but even if you are, theres no guarantee that you would like this movie, as some fans clearly havent been impressed. In fact, it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than I have, so maybe it WONT help. Like I said, theres no guarantee. I would say whatever you may think of Steve Irwin and his show, this movie was unnecessary. The attempt to combine what is usually seen in  Crocodile Hunter  with a fictional story unfortunately failed, and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes #0
6683_1#Im glad the folks at IMDb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into. I had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy, but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama I wasnt sure. For a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous  twist  ending, which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is. It is hard to describe just how amateurish THE HAZING really is. Did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing? Actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is.#0
2132_4#This film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo the list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end. There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.#0
4779_10#On paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring. The idea of a 75-year-old man traveling the country-side on a riding mower certainly doesnt have much appeal to it, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than  The Straight Story.   The Straight Story  is the rare live-action  G -rated movie that truly should not be missed. Grade A#1
11968_10#Full House is a great show. I am still today growing up on it. I started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it. i fell in love with all of the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite. she had such a sense of humor. in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show, you should because you will get hooked on it. i became hooked on it after the first show i saw, which just happened to be the first episode, in 2002. it really is a good show. i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families. and its great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages. and for all parents, it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life. nothing terrible happens, like violence or swearing. it is just a really great sit-com. i give it 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think? OH and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office. It will make you feel a lot better. Trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better. and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid, well thats too bad for you because you wont get as far in life even if you are happy with your life. you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it. i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show. well i need must go to have some lunch. remember you must start watching full house and soon!#1
9375_4#Its about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old Indian traditions. At times it is clear how most of the doctors are charlatans, even lying about how they dont charge their clients. While they are wearing their gold watches, the donation box is mandatory. Notice that there are only a couple of people who get cured while we see quite a few cases. Keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest Indian bank note is 5 rupee, while the average salary in India is 1,700 ru/month.#0
10888_8#This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides money is not enough, so he rents the family who lives where he thought HIS family did. OK? This is a great little high school soap, PG-13, but the small sex references are comedy, so if your kid cant handle them, they cant live in the real world, either. This is a happy film, after all, and it leaves you feeling good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There really IS something for everyone.#1
9910_1#One of the worst films ever. Not funny, poor TV style cinematography, bad acting. Sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, let alone act. Lead female Nancy Young cant act. Terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Occasional weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense. Somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but theres no logic behind their actions. Slow pacing made my wife stop watching but I suffered through it. The old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny, but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny. How did they even get the money to make this?#0
3522_2#If you like the standard Sly flicks that involve over the top action, unbelievable stunts (unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here), and retarded dialogue; you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stalone was going to be forced in his  has-been  days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, setting, and (believable) action would prevail. I crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous. Judge Dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie. The character, setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves. Cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into Rambo before you can say  yo, Adrian!  #0
8331_8#this movie is a very relaxed, romantic-comedy, which is thoroughly enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of Albert Einstein, though she does believe in her own skills. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up. I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein. This movie just has a very relaxing feel to it, while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it (if that is actually possible, it happens here). I personally found this movie extremely entertaining, especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a cheeky sense of humour, this is the movie for you!#1
5113_10#This movie was a classic. I would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes. if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did. It had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life, and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a  BIG THROAT  and swallow are pride.#1
163_10#First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget, yet had the flavor of the early Coen brothers film Blood Simple  and throw in some Monty Python flavorings to boot! Needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor.#1
6718_10#I have this movie on DVD and must have watched it thirty times by now. I must really love it, right? Well, not really. It is just that the movie could have been so much more. The very last part of the movie, when the credits roll, gives a hint of what it could have been. There are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack. (The soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish, though you may like it if you are fan of the modern, frenetic school of rock.) Anyway theres my two cents#1
2994_4#Ive now seen this film twice, and I must say I enjoyed it both times. Its fast paced and fun, but ultimately daft. Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original. It is clear for those who have seen the awful Zombie Creeping Flesh that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei, and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci. This is not idle Fulci sycophancy, the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout, and you can tell who directed what, particularly in Matteis case. All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest, rather than simply a through and through bad film. If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that Ive come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties.#0
2679_8#Delirious, near plot-less mood piece and if its more LSD inspired than the Devil then we must remember when it was made! After a startling SM opening (which even itself is not what it seems) we move to soft focus and dream or imaginings or remembering. Lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the Franco film that Lang himself praised. Beautiful and mesmerising the film unfolds at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold. A rare movie to languish within. Old Jess could make em when he tried. Fine central performances too including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I havent even mentioned the Lisbon locations - ah!#1
11757_9#Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play guys in their 30s who put their marraiges in jeopardy by deciding (Russell somewhat reluctantly) to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival Bakersfield years after the fact. Williams is ok, but Russell is flat-out great as legendary Taft quarterback Remo Hightower. Holly Palance does a nice and attractive turn as Williams wife, who could live without this rematch. Film is worth watching just to see the famed Remo in action. Highly recommended.#1
12212_10#What is so taboo about love?! People seem to have major problems with the transgenered. The title of this movie didnt catch my eye. It was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing. I could not believe how freaking amazing this film was. It touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way. It is by far one of the best independent films I have ever seen. I did not view these characters as either gender, just human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent films. Praise to all fearless filmmakers!#1
11373_2#It is not obvious from viewing this film (so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it) but this presentation on the realities of Islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-Muslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of Islam, will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system. There is reason to call much about the presenters into question, such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; dont swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker, without some thinking of your own. When you watch this film, you need to have the salt shaker on hand. One grain will not be enough, youll need more. Please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together, indicating a definite bias. Be your own brain.#0
7351_10#This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and best film of 1994. David Dhawan does a great job in directing this movie, he makes it funny and adds family drama. Govinda is Excellent as Raja Babu and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress i hate, this film she is a little less annoying but still annoys in some scenes. Kader Khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives a superb performance. Aroona Irani is terrific as the mother and gives a outstanding performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu the sidekick. This film has Comedy, action, family drama and romance a full on entertainer.#1
6075_10#Students often ask me why I choose this version of Othello. Shakespeares text is strongly truncated and the film contains material which earned it an  R  rating. Third, Shakespeare was never G rated. He never has been. His stage productions were always typified by violence and strong language. But Shakespeares genius uses these elements not as sensationialism but for artistic honesty.#1
753_8#Story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most level-headed of the bunch--but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks shes more mature than the rest of them. A very good movie--essential viewing if you came of age in 1980. The film has a deserved R rating (plenty of drug use and swearing) but should be seen by all teens. I give it a 8.#1
3207_7#Of course, by any normal standard of film criticism, Soldier is a very poor film indeed. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats. 7 out of 10#1
546_2#Those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what any good parent doeskick his son out the son with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow- 1. Priyanka cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom and to go from that to living hungry in her in-laws garden shed???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man, gets bitten by rabified dogs, to then just walk off. This film is an INSulT to our intelligence I really cant believe i contributed financially to the people who made this film by taking my family to see it, we left the cinema with a frown, please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your waqt.#0
6903_9#This little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over. Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! A tongue-in-cheek, menacingly humorous Gomez Addams, with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft-told story. Generally untrumpeted and unappreciated, Moon Over Parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen. Two thumbs up!#1
11093_10#This is a great  small  film. I say  small  because it doesnt have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, as in a John Woo film. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three  bad guys . John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. The film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine--instead of everything going around and around, it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens. Wonderful ending, very positive. I never read the Elmore Leonard book, but it cant be much different from the film because it FEELS like Im watching an Elmore Leonard movie.#1
3565_2#Stephen King is generally known for the morbid, and thats fine, but this story is too morbid. Some movies, by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put throughhere you just feel depressed. The movie has a nice feel to it (at first), with the family moving to the country, and creepy old Fred Gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery, but this plot leads nowhere. It starts with so much potential, but by the end, it loses the potential to be a good horror movie, and becomes corny, extremely stupid, and ultimately depressing. My rating   out of     . 90 mins. R for violence.#0
1441_2#I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of  Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom . Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn i have had before though. This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were none. The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed. It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your kids that. I dont. Keep away from this one. If you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere.#0

10729_1#Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the more (most!)open-minded movie-viewersMovies are my passion, and I am a big regular at my local cult-movie-rental-placeI also feel the need to add that they often ask ME for advice about movies whenever I get there, and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult-movie-areaI love to rent strange stuff, and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult-movie-video-place.He told me he thought I had to see this, and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a Jodorowsky(one of my favorites!)atmosphere, I rented it. Not awful,a 1 as I said.Just not my cup of tea(or wodka for that matter)#0
4747_8#Anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also did the fights in The Matrix. And the fight scenes are somethin. There are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie (one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices). The fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; the body count is way up there. Li has seldom been better, and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars (Yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier). Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (no suprises there; he makes a cameo in every HK movie). Its unfortunate they dont make action movies like this in the US; I wouldnt have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that I crave so much. Recommended.#1
8936_1#MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately. Praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent, even from the people involved in making it. This film was loathed from day one. While every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds (aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism), the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do. Its not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like SCARFACE, or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like SHOWGIRLS.  MYRA BRECKINRIDGE doesnt seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty. It hates Hollywood, it hates America, it hates sex, it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and Laurel and Hardy and, well, you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it. In a very sad and sorry way, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE may be the first punk manifesto, a celebration of pop culture nihilism.#0
10933_1#Trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation youve heard about semi-devout Mormons, and youll see theyve all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film. Finally Kurt Hales fortunes have changed (thank goodness) and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters. The only reason I didnt give this movie a negative rating was because the scale wont let me.#0
10114_1#This is one of the worst films ever. I like cheesy movies but this is simply awful. Where are the images in the film that are on the box? I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire film.  Even if curiosity is motivating you, stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead. It will be much more enjoyable. You have been warned!#0
6483_10#This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the end of World War 2. The origins are not entirely examined fully from Germanys fall at the hands of the Versailles treaty which helped propel Hitlers demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a 26-part series with so much to cram in.  A series to own as a box set in history terms, on DVD for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be well proud.#1
4413_1#Broad enough for you? Wait till you see this heavy handed open up to film well. Not a lot of fun.#0
3853_9#I dont know if Id consider it a masterpiece of not, but its damn near close; its extremely well made, artistic, suspenseful, intricately plotted, thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual-religious imagery. Theres also some great camera-work from Jan de Bont, an atmospheric score from Loek Dikker and outstanding acting from Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk, the latter giving one of the most sneaky, subtle femme fatale performance Ive ever seen. Like many other European movies, this movie has an unashamed, non-judgmental attitude toward sex, nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and/or surrealistic (some would say blasphemous) images. In other words, if you cant bear the thought of seeing a lust-driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as Jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you. What surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess. It mixes the abstract/surreal/parallel fantasy-reality scenes and somehow makes it all work. Like any good mystery, you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses. There is NOT an out-of-left-field resolution here. The movie has direction, theres no needless filler and once it concludes, you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier. If you like the work of Ken Russell and David Lynch, I can almost guarantee you will love this movie. Hell, if you have no idea who they even are, you still might like it. THE 4TH MAN was a huge art-house success in much of the world, but didnt make it over to the US until 1984, where it was awarded the Best Foreign Film of the year from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. The most common video is the Media release, which has been horribly dubbed. Try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled Anchor Bay DVD release. Since coming to America, Verhoevens career has had its ups and downs. He has made a few decent films (Flesh & Blood, RoboCop) and some lousy ones (Showgirls). In fact, Verhoevens big hit Basic Instinct is almost like a less interesting, junior league version of The Fourth Man. Soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in America and since GRAVE SECRETS (1989) and EVE OF DESTRUCTION (1991) were the best offers she was getting, she headed right back home to the Netherlands.#1

Call me over the shock-rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall for this. But dont expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified that she is doing her fatherI mean hasnt that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with rape, and molestation pornHorror isnt what your mind can fool you into believing. It is what actually exists in film. This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.#0
50_4#Three part  horror  film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go  out there  and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why. All in all, the first one is worth watching, but thats it. Tune in for that one then turn it off.#0
9934_8#  Domino   has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and   sickening   photography. Its detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of   style over substance  I couldnt disagree more.

I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scotts work#1
12336_3#I give this five out of 10. All five marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material. Unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! We have countless full-face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? We dont see his hands on the guitar thats the point! Also were given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind? There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur fools operate all of them. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, complete waste of film! If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. The one gem it does contain is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight#0

1484_2#please dont rent or even think about buying this movie.they dont even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a $1 & i think its worth less than that.the main reason why i rented this d movie was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min.i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know.Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this movie than Jenna & shes not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name.i recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see Jenna almost throughout the whole movie & nude most of the time.this movie is a big disappointment & such a huge waste of time.#0
4634_10#This film is a complete re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus. The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus. There is a border between them, and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs. The situation is bleak enough. We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap. But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay, Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus. To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv. It is off limits in Nablus. The conflict between the two peoples, the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures, two ethics. But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension. Ashrafs sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus. Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay. She cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later. From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack. It takes place in a café in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noams is severely wounded. Bad enough. The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack, but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street. The funeral follows the wedding. The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack. Ashraf volunteers to take his place. The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister. He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noams. But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him. Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street. The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death. We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona, a neutral character that can impose peace, or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel. The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides. But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film, a play that shows love in Auschwitz, between two prisoners, one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle. This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking gay love in Auschwitz. What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible. The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on. We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago. Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated. This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution. But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations. So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden, of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on so lets procreate more and more little soldiers. But love is just an extra-terrestrial concept. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne#1
2052_10#I dont have much to add to my summary, this film ranks right up the there with Top Gun as one of the funniest films ever made while not trying to be. I for one dont think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable. If anyone reads this looking for information on McBain (and I seriously doubt therell be too many) just know that it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face!#1
6204_1#Violence whether real or not always has an impact. In this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for. In the Great Ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of. But what was the point? The violence looks like a mix of Noës Irreversible, and  Kubricks Clockwork Orangeboth of which are remarkable films. Dont get me wrong, Im not opposed to screen violence at all and Ive seen some nasty stuff in my film-going years, but this film as a whole is totally juvenile. The story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence, the rizla paper thin reason we are give for Roberts demise is his introduction to drugs. Danny Dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for Roberts drug fuelled demise, however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes. Lesley Manville is Roberts unable to cope mum, I am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber. The acting is wooden, the scene in the kitchen with the TV-cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale- who wrote those dialogues?! Some of the comments the boys makelooks like shes enjoying it are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for Clays ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals. Why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the directors adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imageryone can only wonder at this young mans psychology. My opinion derivative, badly-made and pointless.#0
3220_4#I absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end, after youve already invested an hour into it. and thats what happened with this film. i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story. I havent gone to read that story but I cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends.Fortunately i didnt pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting (the wife in particular was so perfect).but milo oshea as a Jew?  now THAT was funny. I havent researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the film. Before that point, a story and characters were developing,there were a number of neat plot points and there wasnt too much time wasted. but ooh that last 1/2 hour- if that wasnt the screwiest, most worthless denouement Ive ever witnessed, I dont know what is. I just hate it when ones faith is so destroyed like that; it feels like an act of violence.#0
1595_1#The movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was out of course and didnt have as an interest as the other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same corny humor and cliche bad guys. The movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The movie should better not associated with animes such as Dragonballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime. It is a shame even to talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon. Digimon is more of an anime and doesnt fall anywhere close to Pokemon.Its second movie is coming out late 2002.#0
11960_8# Scoop  is also the name of a late-Thirties Evelyn Waugh novel, and Woody Allens new movie, though set today, has a nostalgic charm and simplicity. It hasnt the depth of characterization, intense performances, suspense or shocking final frisson of Allens penultimate effort  Match Point,  (argued by many, including this reviewer, to be a strong return to form) but  Scoop  does closely resemble Allens last outing in its focus on English aristocrats, posh London flats, murder, and detection. This time Woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy, and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian, a magician called Sid Waterman, stage moniker The Great Splendini, who counters some snobs probing with,  I used to be of the Hebrew persuasion, but as I got older, I converted to narcissism.  Following a revelation in the midst of Splendinis standard dematerializing act, with Scarlett Johansson (as Sondra Pransky) the audience volunteer, the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace English journalists post-mortem attempt to score one last top news story. On the edge of the Styx Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) has just met the shade of one Lord Lymans sons secretary, who says she was poisoned, and shes told him the charming aristocratic bounder son Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) was the Tarot Card murderer, a London serial killer. Sondra and Sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths. With Sids deadpan wit and Sondras bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the London aristocracy. This isnt as strong a film as  Match Point,  but to say its a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong. It has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a TV show, but Woodys jokes are far funnier and more original than youll get in any such media affair, and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness. It doesnt matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when its diverting summer entertainment. On a hot day you dont want a heavy meal. The whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment, without crude jokes or bombastic effects; without Vince Vaughan or Owen Wilson. Critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the Allen decline that preceded  Match Point.  Dont believe them. He doesnt try too hard. Why should he? He may be 70, but verbally, hes still light on his feet. And his body moves pretty fast too.#1
5002_8#I was privileged to have seen some snippets from Aardmans original run of this show in the UK. It was always fun and always funny. None of the charm has been lost in translation--its as fresh as the people interviewed--whether some of it is scripted or not, as has been rumored, is beside the point. Its always entertaining. Aardman Animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the single aspect that I probably love most about the show and its concept (the hostility between the pandas, the porcupines discussing fear of needles, the painting ape). Regulars really grow on you as well, such as the horse and donkey teens from Maryland, most every married couple (the parrots, the insects, and the cats to name a few) and child-voiced character, and Ive really come to dig the ferret! Mondays finally become a day to which to look forward.#1
11457_4#OK. I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this film ran pretty low. Unless youve got some wierd Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess, Rob Lowe) fetish, theres really no reason to see this one.#0
6131_10#This is one of the funniest movies that I have seen this year. The people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted. It is a beautiful thing. There were a lot of quality one-liners. This movie blew Uncle Sam out of the water (it was made by tha same people, i think)#1
5437_4#Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends. The year is 1983, and young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely opposed to his fathers lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography, the whole film feels like the director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was funny if outright commercial - is desperately seeking indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films but sprinkling it with stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many of the star-laden premieres at Sundance this year it felt like this was a secrety studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points - it failed in that respect and as a film in its own right.#0
1060_4#OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world, is prescient. Thats it. Thats the good stuff. The actingfair. The plotsilly. The  twist  unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated. Dont you think bureaucrats have a manual for  plagues  and how to contain them? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It isnt to send them off to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why was the plane door open and the  shooters standing there with no protection? In fact, did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs? That would stop her. But not as dramatic. Im a sucker. I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it. But this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it using a recorder so I didnt have to watch all the ads, that was a plus. Its a good example of why I watch so little network TV. Rubbish.#0

8352_1#I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of  romance  and  western  with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in. But if youre expecting a typical wholesome romantic western, forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. Its sickening. I dont see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles.#0

6123_4#When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that Im older, I can honestly say that this film is awful. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes one big dull ride. And Tarzan, well, hes all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (thats Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesnt know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this might fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, go elsewherealmost anywhere else at that #0
4247_10#THE GIRL FROM MISSOURI arrives in New York City knowing exactly what she wants to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon, but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love? It should be noted that this film was produced soon after Hollywoods Production Code was instituted. A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which Harlows character goes after the same ends, but uses very different means.#1
9665_10#Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you cant see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. Her more  vocally correct  version of  Stay With Me  never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.#1
11764_3#I have to say I was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films. I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack(which I listened to before I saw the film) sounded different from others, maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces(apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors) and supposedly dealed within its script with modern social behaviour, maybe because its photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical. The film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser, and a major letdown. What Serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned  battle of the sexes  as in  all men are the same  and  why is it that all women;  blah,blah,blah. Nothing new in it, not even that, it uses so much common ground and clichè that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female/male condition. Full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichès I talked about before(those always work, always) and screaming performances(it is a well acted film in its context)..and by screaming I mean, literally. The at first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be according to Serrano the more pathetic ones. I completely disagree with Serrano, they shouldnt have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come throughhe made sure we got HIS message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood. Anyway, it is after all, a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it (if you accept to be manipulated by it).#0
1401_7#Okay, weve got extreme Verhoeven violence (Although not as extreme as other Verhoeven flicks), weve got plenty of sex and nudity, but something is missingOh, yes, its missing the intelligence that Paul Verhoeven is known for in his sci-fi movies. I admire the way Verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the movie itself doesnt have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre. The acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films. The problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive. Here, it takes place at a lab for the most part. I would have enjoyed seeing the invisible Kevin Bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or lets say steal something from peoples purses, or something like that. But what is shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man an entertaining movie. Grade B#1
11109_9#The Sopranos stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting the story in the milieu of the underworld, David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post-modern era.  PS A good companion piece to Chases series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting.#1
1687_1#If you go see this movie youll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre, the director, the producer, the actors and the person that told you to go see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie. It may have been more scary if the Japanese actors would have just spoken in Japanese instead of attempting to act in English. I wanted to boo when the movie endeda true disappointment after all of the hype on TV and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle really didnt have to act at all to make this movieshe just practiced her frowning skills. Dont waste your time or money on this film.#0

8113_4#POPEYE AND BIG FOOT   ; POPEYES ENGINE COMPANY   ; GETTING POPEYES GOAT   1/2 Taking each short per se, I guess they improved from one to the other after the initial shock, one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were, so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  Popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief (hardly original, I know, but always an amusing ploy). One interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with Popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience.#0
433_10#This is one of those rare movies, its lovely and compelling, dignified and quirky, a true gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience (yup, find the magic). I especially loved Josie Lawrence, as Lottie Wilkins, but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film. Further the costumes, if youre drawn to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well done. I just wish theyd release it on DVD because Im wearing my tape version out!  Absolutely well worth your time, just make sure to settle in to watch it, without any interruptions.#1
3158_2#This really was the worst movie I have ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie, the hair is so bad! They talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry. The cover of the DVD does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is. Really, really boring. I had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good? hhaha they literally just like talk and say  yeah  and there is no passion whatsoever. I could not tell at all that they were in love. Im sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I have ever seen.#0

This one is a prime candidate.#0
966_2#Films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning. While there are some exceptions, the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes. The kids in Paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds, as theyre both very annoying and they dont have an ounce of acting ability between them. In short; theyre rubbish. This isnt good considering that theyre the leads, and it especially isnt good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors. Its a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isnt (not completely). It follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created. It soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings, and so sets about making various changes, until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare. Oh dear. As you can see, this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie. However, it is squandered through a number of fatal faults. First and foremost, in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale. The central plot is hardly played with at all, and the result is an entirely boring experience. The lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie, as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just dont care any more (which is due to a lack of ideas). Thanks in part to its lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout. This is to be expected as it stars kids, but Bernard Rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best. The film is also very cheesy, and the romance between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy, and makes for very painful viewing. In fact, if I had to sum this travesty up in one word, I would choose painful. Paperhouse is poorly acted, laughably plotted, very corny and dull on the whole. Save yourself the pain, see something else.#0
10636_4#I was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that The Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed! Yet again we are led to believe that the KGB are a group of inept morons who dont have a clue what they are doing. At one point there is a laughable scene where 4 KGB agents couldnt handle one CIA agent. I grow weary of these biased, one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the Spy game that went on during the cold war. I find it laughable that the US is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in WW2 and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the US obtained the Enigma machine, again, utterly false. S#0
3331_8#Admittedly, I know nothing about baseball, Im not even a fan of the sport, but that didnt stop me enjoying the Farrelly brothers latest film, Fever Pitch, a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy. The film is not really about baseball; rather, its really about relationships, and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place. Much of the movie was filmed at Bostons Fenway Park, which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings, as well as the ambiance of the games, though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados. Even so, Fever Pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect. Mike Leonard September 05.#1
2752_1#Whatever his name is (the writer and director) should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again. This one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad in a way that theyre actually sort of good. Not this one. This was so bad I got angry. Seriously. A drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script. What a waste. ALL the actors were completely uninspired to work at all, the CGI was barely acceptable, the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was, its like he just decided,  I want this to happen and this to happen, but I dont care how we got there, just shoot it and put it in. Whatever, Im going back to my trailer to pick my nose, if anyone calls for me, Im not here.  Shame on you whatever your name is. Shame on you.#0
7263_4#This star-studded British/Spanish co-production looks great, what you can see of it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly cropped, so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other. Few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one, as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once, neglecting the middle. Another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrating, and thats it. We never find out why Shaw has become a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas) although I suspect he was called home to star in Kojak, as his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old English music hall tradition to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some lyrics Ive never heard before. On the plus side, the location is great, a huge old ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs leading nowhere, some nice scenery-chewing by Robert Shaw, and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri, and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I didnt really like this film, but I havent exactly seen it. I will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then.#0
739_1#Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin on the wrong foot first step, by assuming that Wells wrote Gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously. That simply isnt true. Wells was very much an inheritor of the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian self-satisfaction might leave the British unprepared for the world the new technology could produce - both the good and the bad. Do not avoid this film - steal every copy you can (dont pay a cent) and burn each and every one of them. God in his wisdom created us just for this purpose.#0
5648_2#Boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the barn door and th pig slop it has created! When this show first aired almost four season back it was a humorous slap at the legal system which all actors seem to take pride in portraying. It was funny, diversified, and to some extent factual. The characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals. The sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragged to the lower depths of Media programming of sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this  production . Rene Adjurdubois Is an excellent actor who has from the days of  Benson  to this production held his own in the field of entertainment, always showing the humor and respectful acting of the production. Captain Kirk  is . Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt in his acting ability, however he should go back to his XXX origins such as  Crash  as it appears he has much talent and inclination in that direction. We ask that this series be trashed as it already is and its really starting to smell #0
4221_8#I loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact. While I like when a episode of Columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one, its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, along with the uncovering of the murderer. The interplay between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon, playing a famous writer, makes some comment about being flattered by the famous Lt. Columbo, making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detectives real life fame as a crime-solver. This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments.#1

11611_9#Japan 1918. The story of 16-year old Ryu begins with the death of her father. As it will be revealed later, both of her parents have died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation Ryus aunt has arranged a marriage with a Japanese man in Hawai, whom they know only from its picture. By her arrival in Hawai ryu discovers that her new husband is much older as in the photograph ,and that he lives in very humble circumstances beside a sugar cane plantage were he works on. Ryu not used to the hard labour on the plantage and in despair over her situation in her new home thinks of running away. She soon discovers that she has nowhere to go. The friendship to Kana, a female co-worker of hers, gives her new hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian woman were married off to men in America, whom they only knew from their picture. This not very well known picture is well written and acted. The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his very last screen appearance as a Benshi (narrator of silent movies). This film gives some insight of Japanese culture here and across the ocean. A must see!#1

6001_7#By no means a masterpiece, and far from Errol Flynns best, Istanbul still has much going for it. The locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography, bring us back to a time long since past. Errol Flynn does show moments of his past glory, and is OK as Jim Brennan, a pilot whos past comes back to haunt him. The picture is actually a remake of 1947s  Singapore , and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche by todays standards. Also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply  going through the motions  in this picture. Many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats, CASABLANCA. While watching the film, I could see many of the similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take that for what its worth. In closing, if you are a fan of Flynn, or old fashioned love stories, you might want to give this film a look. Otherwise, Id recommend Casablanca, or The Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some of Hollywoods classics.#1
2284_3#Now, I wont deny that when I purchased this off eBay, I had high expectations. This was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy that I so enjoy. However, I was soon to be disappointed. Apologies to those who enjoyed it, but I just found the Compleat Al to be very difficult to watch. I got a few smiles, sure, but the majority of the funny came from the music videos (which Ive got on DVD) and the rest was basically filler. You could tell that this was not Als greatest video achievement (that honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I doubt if this will ever make the jump to DVD, so if youre an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just HAVE to own everything, buy the tape off eBay. Just dont pay too much for it.#0
2021_3#Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeares Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here, and the backstage business is overripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him,  What are ya? Some kind of nut? ). Otherwise, this scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very funny.  1/2 from     #0
7763_8#One thing about Hollywood, someone has a success and its always rushed to be copied. And another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio. If you like splashy technicolor Fifties soap opera than this is the film for you.#1
4739_7#Very good martial arts film and Jet Li is the best since the master himself Bruce Lee .Li is excellent as the low key librarian/cop who saves all time and time again . He has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you dont mess with .Francoise Yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage , she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that I found unforgettable .The villain , the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but I cant find his name in the credits , can some one help me out with that ? Thanks ! Enjoy Hak hap or Black Mask , in any language its good entertainment !#1
3793_7#This is the first American film to successfully adopt the naturalistic style used by Europeans, particularly the French and Belgians, for at least a decade, and isnt it about time? Following three high school girls in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between freshman and sophomore years, it does what all good art should it discovers the universal in the particular. Even though the girls preoccupations are outwardly conventional--boys, sex, popularity, money, freedom, and clothes--we glimpse how their whole lives are being shaped, the universal interface between character and destiny. This is by far the best dramatic American film Ive seen in years. See it, see it, see it.#1
7417_10#This beautiful story of an elder son coming home, and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from, is poignant and moving. It shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the Western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad, and at times funny and comic. It has a feeling of realism that we dont seem to see any longer in our western movies. Would love to see more movies by this director.#1
5337_1#Theres so many negative reviews about  Stay away, Joe  in here I just cant stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen. Heres a side you havent heard yet. In my books  Stay away, Joe  definitely falls into the  so bad its good -category. Now if youre like me and appreciate  the trash value , this is the ultimate 1960s camp experience. Its so bad that its almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it cant possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways. In the end youre so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just dont know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell I love it because its so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this. I still give it 1 out of 10 though - once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic.#0
10409_2#As if the storyline wasnt depressing enough, this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher. Weird stuff. Then theres the core premise of the hero/heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a hes besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what sort of traumatic childhood did he have? Just that he didnt get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly. He tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did, but its really really so hard to empathize. Such sad and unusual self destruction. Was it supposed to be funny? What was it all about really?#0
7814_10#This is an absolutely incredible film. It shows South African racism from the perspective of the victims, and provokes a feeling of anti-racism in everyone who sees it. It is the best historic film I have ever seen.#1
10597_2#This movie was absolutly awful. I cant think of one thing good about it. The plot holes were so huge you could drive a Hummer through them. The acting was soo stuningly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that is saying alot  And dialogue, What dialogue???To think that I was a fan of the first one (I use that comment loosely, its more like a guilty pleasure, than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it for crying out loud  Nothing good can come of this movie. What makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you cant even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of  This has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1.#0
3961_3#What a dog of a movie. Noni Hazelhursts performance is quite good, but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting, mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast. Many of the characters are woefully miscast, particularly the ever overrated Colin Friels. Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than a weekday TV movie matinée. Crud like this, perfectly well shot and technically presented, but a cliché-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere. At least Noni gets down to her birthday suit at every given opportunity. Theres no other sane reason to endure this junk.#0
2864_1#This film is so bad it simply defies reality. The filming is grade school material at best, the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form. So bad it cant even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of Showgirls. The ONLY thing this DVD had going for it was the cover art.  All I can write to those of you who havent had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and dont waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage. If you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects, there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash.#0
12445_4#This was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970s, usually on the  4am Movie  or one time, on the 730 PM  Channel 6 Big Movie  and still another on Creature Double Feature.WHen local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming(mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time) It was of the time. A couple of low-rent Abbott and Costello wannabees(Frankie Ray and Robert Ball) are in a platoon of soldiers(half a dozen guys in Army Surplus remainders) who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation, and wind up encountering extraterrestrials. They first go into Bronson Canyon to what would be later the famous Batcave on BATMAN, and encounter the remains of a dead  carrot monster . Later, in the cave theyre chased by a living carrot creature-basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head, with sparkly things on it and ping-pong ball eyes. Two of them-complete geeks,Ray and Ball-are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being  examined  by space amazons-Dr Poona(nooo kidding!) and Professor Tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini  uniforms . We were too young at the time,to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this  examination  scene would more than suggest. Turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster, are stranded on earth with a ship thats well hidden and are trying to return to their world. For some reason I only thought Id imagined seeing this film to start with. No, I really saw it. And when it was released on  restored  DVD I was assured in my memory. The comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid, but whatever.The budget is non-existent, which, is a minor miracle when you think about it, that it even got made and we can talk about a  restored  version here and now-over 40 years later. The payoff is the girls who want to learn about  love  and  kissing  and, the upshot is the geeks-which all of us were- get the girls and love wins out. Its just goofy and silly and for the locations, has nostalgic significance.#0
12041_9#This is a plain old spooky ghost story. I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club, and they were kept spellbound until the ending! No blood or gore- just good old fashioned suspense. It starts out right from the beginning, and builds and builds. The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares.  Its a shame its not readily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with  Haunted  are probably two of the best Ghost Stories Ive ever scene. Which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes  in your face  gore any day #1
9950_2#Had the original casting idea been kept (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie might have worked. Sadly, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and mess it up. The predominantly black production staff couldnt allow the antagonist be black, so they swapped Rutgers and Ice-Ts roles. This was only the start of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickersons news-room approach to directing only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment. Master shot, close up, close up. Gads, Whos Line Is It Anyway even uses more creative camera work. Erics rewrite of The Most Dangerous Game is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale, but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this. We are never given the reasons, other than  no one will miss these people , why the leader (re-written as Rutger) does these things. Aside from a heart-felt performance by John McGinley, and a fair job by Charles Dutton, do not bother with this one. One small bit of trivia, there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured F.Murray Abraham, and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident.#0

11707_10#I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, back then even though it didnt have any special effects, the acting was really good. And it still has the same message for today, even though the technology has changed, maybe they should make a remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music from the movie as well, Larry Norman was a really good songwriter during that time period, although now most Christian music is now worship and praise music. I was always curious to know what ever happened to Patty after the series ended? Did she go on to make more movies, did she get eventually get married and raise a family? I would like to have an update.#1
5461_7#Escaping the life of being pimped by her father(..and the speakeasy waitressing)who dies in an explosion, Lily Powers(Barbara Stanwyck, who is simply ravishing)sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city Gotham. When a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law(and Lilys new lover), the skys the limit for Lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesnt come into her hands. Newly appointed president to the bank, Courtland Trenholm(George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of forking over lots of dough, but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the City of Love. This makes Lilys mouth water as now shell have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way. Though, circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches..Trenholm, now her husband, is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank. He needs money Lily now has in her possession or hell have absolutely nothing. Stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual Warner Brothers polish. Being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy. Good direction from Alfred E Green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of Stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act. Obviously the film shows that money isnt everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of Lilys dead heart. That ending having Lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didnt ring true to me. Shes spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him.#1
6029_7#There arent too many times when I see a film and go,  huh, what? , but this was one of them. Maybe after seeing Zabriskie Point I felt much the same way Woody Allen felt after seeing 2001- he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period, realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on. Michelangelo Antonioni, in one of his few tries at making films inside of the US (after Red Desert, he did Blow-Up, this film, China, and The Passenger, all filmed outside his native Italy), I could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium. The results show that he doesnt lack the means to present images, feelings, tones, colors, sounds, and a visual representation of this era.  A directors job is to see , Antonioni once stated. Whatever that means, he doesnt disappoint for the admirer of his post-fifties work (I say post-fifties since Ive yet to see any of his films from before LAvventura). The deserts, skies, city, and even the faces in close-ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame, bringing us in. The soundtrack is equally compelling, with a master stroke including a sweet Rolling Stones song at one point, and then a crushing, surreal Pink Floyd song (re-titled from Careful with that Axe Eugene, one of their best pre-Dark Side) in the explosion sequence. If only the performances werent so one-sided I might find this to be on par with Blow-Up or The Eclipse. Its an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand, and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie/radical movement of the late 60s. But hey, what may be boring for an American such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the US, such as say, Italy. And it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing.#1
9462_1#Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents dont be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary. The Cat in the Hat may be the worst kids movie ever.#0
6205_8#Convoluted, infuriating and implausible, Fay Grim is hard to sit through but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. Shes at once touching,funny, cunning. The supporting actors commit to it as well. Fay Grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something that isnt cookie-cutter. In the end, it offers something that defies description.#1
4468_1#OK, plain and simple, if you are a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP AWAY FROM LEGEND. My advice to any serious TR fan is keep away from this game, and if you do buy it complain to Eidos. I have seen masses of other posts, mainly on the Eidos forums, from people telling them how rubbish it is, perhaps they will listen.#0
6653_3#I just saw this movie, and I have to say that it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) cant act at all. She read her lines very un-naturally, and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie. Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is a natural. She played her part with great perfection. This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I dont recommend it #0
6957_1#Avoid this one, unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie. Example? The sound is good but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a French film. Someone should do a Whats Up Tiger Lily on this bomb. Rewrite the script and then either dub or subtitle it. Heck, its almost that now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to American audiences, have roles.)#0
10733_4#Im starting to think that theres a conspiracy, all right one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film, despite its obscurity, will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a  universal acclaim  or something within that range, thus ensuring unsuspecting folk (like me) will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing, expecting a surprise, only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck. Firstly, there is the ever-present number four from start to finish. While having a little symbolism here and there is okay, and its been done with various degrees of success in many well-known movies, this movie is panting with it. Four dogs at the start of the movie, looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly, machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt. Four people in a bar, although one of them is a non-entity. Three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless, not only to each other but to what their lives are not. While this concept may work, the movie meanders so much -- particularly with the story of the would-be model played by Marina Vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre, and not in a good way -- that the initial theme gets lost in translation. Or maybe, like I said before, I just  didnt get it.  The problem also lies in that so much time is spent on Marinas story (which revolves on the death of her sister, from bread-chewing, no less, and the subsequent, shrill mourning which follows) that any interest in the inherent Surrealism dissipates without a trace. So what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own? The director doesnt invest much time in truly tying them together, or weaving a tighter story that could, in a David Lynchian way, intersect either with the past-present, or within alternate dimensions, or even as a straightforward, mundane science-fiction story. This is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint (or someone into the weird for weirds sake) could endure.#0
3725_8#There are four great movie depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp. Also, this is a very complex character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie. The character of Boz makes this movie so good. It is a shame it did not get a major release. It belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.#1
7176_1#I have nothing more to say but it was awful. I cannot imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if certain actors dont want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films. There was at least one seen that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think what was going on that was cut from the film. SHUDDER to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film. Shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind. Like I stated before its a degrading mess. Its not even funny. As Ebert said of the film Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, Its not a good film, not a good story and its not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH#0
8803_4#I loved  Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy  and hoped this would be just as funny, but alas, it wasnt. Some bits are excellent though. I thought the sports guy, Champ Kind, professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious. Everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses Burgundy which doesnt get acknowledged either. But on the whole the story doesnt gel. Its a noble attempt, however, to salvage the unused bits from the first movie, including an entire plot about some pretty benign would-be domestic terrorists called  The Alarm Clock.  Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie. The extras on this disk are pretty good, with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy, and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an  exec producer  who Ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way, shape or form. Turns out hes  just a guy  who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. Its some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes#0
6347_9#How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing.

4811_8#Who knew? Dowdy Queen Victoria, the plump Monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband, Prince Albert, actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days. The Young Victoria not only chronicles the young Queens romance with her husband-to-be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne. The performances in the film are uniformly excellent, especially the principals, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. The Young Victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography (no mention of Victorias depression after Alberts death). But Victoria is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson.#1

4201_1#What a horrible comedy. Totally lame. The supposed  humor  was simple and stupid. Stanly Tucci (a great actor) had the only parts worth chuckling at. And he was tied up and gagged at the time. Dont waste your time with this one. It deserves a 0/10.#0
5712_1#After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that its the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like,  We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it  seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like,  I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip  with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The  reasoning  behind each plot turn and new  clue  is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And theres also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for  never shutting up.  Shes clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a  Dr.  title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cages character says,  Dont you ever shut up?  and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like shes a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that its so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy.#0
10624_1#In an otherwise good review, loleralacartelort7890 says  The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation.  This is completely incorrect. There is (and was) no  secret  to radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available. It uses a lightweight  honeycomb  of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin, thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. These materials are actually  better  at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays. Space radiation is a definite problem for  long term  space flight because of the risk of big solar flares. But it simply wasnt a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The Command Module gave them pretty good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) passage through the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon (12 of whom landed), 18 are still alive. Only two have died from cancer Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died from heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa), and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s (Shepard would be 86).#0

621_1#Holy @%& this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of Lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen. I rank this well below anything I have ever watched on film or TV, and thats saying something. I once witnessed a cow crap in a field. I watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half, who knows it might have moved or something. Well that was time better spent than watching this tripe. The acting was non-existent, the plot was somewhere other than on this film. I think I saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to Portland in hopes of becoming a Steven King shi77er. Please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs. Its pretty clear he needs heavy medication and Id willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal. Bah I cant give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone. Let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this Chilton on the rack, walk to your car, start the engine, then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you cant feel your bones vibrate anymore. Be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself. By the way, I watched this after a  buddy  of mine sent his girlfriend over so I could see it. HE dint come over, SHE had too. Whats worse is that she had to watch this $%&@ thing TWICE! I heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this film.#0

10786_3#How this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me. This is a terrible cliché ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done. It really surprises me that so many of these A list stars would agree to this unfunny film. Whats even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states. It does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks, even if the film is terrible. I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore-fest. Billy Crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions. Whatever you do, dont fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this.#0

He puts on the gladiators helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers. Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no, instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death.#0
1340_2#96 minutes of this is cruel..and I love the old Munsters. Yes, the plot is thing; yes the lines are trite; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan. There is so much intrigue (and I use that word with great pause) that I wonder if its an old Starsky & Hutch episode. I lost count of the number of times I noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar. Refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60s (ludicrous) the producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors. Why not let them grow and age? The addition of an Addams Family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the Halloween Party. If you are a real fan of the Munsters then youll have to RENT this mess. It illustrates how some things are better left alone. Even with the (nearly) original cast, this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago.#0
4373_10#I question anyone saying they dont care for this movie. Some reviewers have said it didnt have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. Dont listen to them  If you like Shawshank Redemption and/or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! This is a top 50 movie #1
2880_1#I have never watched a movie in so little time. The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit. It was like watching a poorly produced CBC film. There was obviously no money for lighting, filming, sets, location, scriptwriters, editors, actors Oh, there was absolutely no story either! I need to write ten lines of comment Bad, awful, horrible, wretched, anguishing, tortuous, bilious, nauseous, sickening, fromage, disgusting, flimsy, icky, yucky, pukey, stinky, smelly, vile, putrid, all-thumbs-down, and I dont know if I can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was!#0
6160_1#I wouldnt say this is a  bad  movie. Unfortunately for me, I get the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic. Ive been fencing since i was 14 years old, and this movie portrays it very poorly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and appears to have some fencing background), but most of the other actors--especially the students--just seem to be lost.#0
6668_2#The longer this film went on-and it seemed to tediously go on for ever- the more annoyed I became, as quite frankly, what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense. How on earth do people get to make films like this,or indeed receive finance for such rubbish? Dont be fooled by the relatively high ratings on IMDb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time. And in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns, so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the USA has such an obscene and fatal gun culture.  2/10.#0
7363_9#This is Not a Love Song. It is a love song.#1
5821_4#As others have noted, this should have been an excellent Hammer-style film, and it seems to me that thats how most of the actors were instructed to play it but the screenplay is so leaden, poorly paced, and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies (poor Timothy Dalton is saddled with most of them) that its all too overblown and self-important. This is an uncharacteristically weak performance from Dalton, although he quietly nails the climactic scene where Dr. Rock finally realizes what hes done. The only actor who comes off really well is Patrick Stewart who is a most welcome sight. Freddie Francis may have been a great cinematographer, but he was a lousy director.#0
5124_10#This is a great movie that I dont think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travoltas career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10#1
7843_9#I cant believe that they took this off the air. Especially, when they only had a few more episodes left. My daughter, sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show. We were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings. It is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning. We had a right to see the end. I wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system. They could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about. This could also help promote a new show. People would see it and wonder what it is. Not only could you see what the viewers are watching, you could also use this as a tool for free advertisement for TV and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back #1
3989_1#Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his wronged wife in the dressing room, the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog, so one can hear neither, diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had. The scenes of Annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists, a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd. This entire movie is a cartoon, the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding. The discussion by the black women after flippers wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team, is ridiculous. The rampant racism might be possible to endure, but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this movie is too much. It was a technically poorly made movie. There is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making, the sound track, the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat. I actually felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I have seen by this director and it will be my last.#0

6688_9#In the history of movies based on comic books,  Mystery Men  is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens).  Mystery Men  spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like  Superman  or  Batman,  such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes arent billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found  Mystery Men  to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it doesnt turn into a franchise, its still a joy to watch #1
7374_10#For his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. In the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. The ending is superb. The makers of Blaire Witch obviously watched this film its ending wasnt an end but a beginning of the end. A great movie and only a piece of Japans great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind.#1
2175_1#Carlos Mencia continually, violently, hatefully screaming  B  ch!  at women is like screaming  N  ger!  at black people, except its worse. Remember, the B word, unlike the N word, is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence.  B  ch!  is the last thing women hear before they are raped, beaten, or murdered. This guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence. Sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman-bashing, so that he will sound like a hetero. And how about all the Nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side, clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of woman-hating. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia doesnt believe or support free speech for THEM! Come on, Carlos  do you want women to have the free speech to b  ch-slap you as loudly and violently and big-mouthed as you do, or do you think  free speech  is only for men to crap on women???#0
11917_8#Yeah, the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever I see it. Thats just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating. A very nice family movie with - I concede - a rather corny happy end. But hey, it doesnt really matter, the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes.#1
4036_7#Good luck finding this film to even watch - its not yet released on tape or DVD. I saw on release in the early 70s, was lucky enough to catch it via American Cinematheques preservation efforts, and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years. It gets a  7  based on Karen Black. Youll see why.#1
11559_10#The Odd Couple is a comic gem. One the funniest script ever committed to celluloid - exceeded only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends obsessive compulsive Felix and sloppy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscars wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude. Felixs wife leaves him at the start of the movie, and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy Oscar. Thats when the fun begins. My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the Pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave Matthau and Lemmon is totally out of his element. This one requires repeat viewings #1
7403_3#This was not the worst movie Ive ever seen, but thats about as much as can be said about it. It starts off with some good atmosphere; the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating, the mood is set to  eerie . And thennothing. Well, somethings. Just somethings that clearly dont fit inand no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critters, and the hospital theyve taken over. I mean, come on, biker duds? Some band watched a bit too much Gwar. The other monsters are even more cartoonish, and even less scary. At least, on the DVD, the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospitalthey apparently just randomly pop up in places, play some bippy  metal , and cause people to be dead a bit. Barring a few good special effects, and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing, theres just nothing here. Its a background-noise movie only.#0
763_10#This movie changed it all for meI heard of breakdancing and hiphop, but had never seen it professionally done (hey I was an 11-year old kid from Holland!) When I saw this movie, this all changed. I got actively involved in the hiphop-movement in our city, started breakdancing and writing lyrics. To this day, I still consider this movie to be a personal favorite. Sure, the filming and  cinematographic  importance might not be that significant. But who cares if the wide-shot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody? Its what it does to you personally that counts#1
1676_4#Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very engaging actors giving decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Infamous for his well-endowments, a drug addict, and a guy who, despite contracting AIDS, continued to make adult films, just does not make an intriguing character. There is no one to sympathize with in this film, as everyone is a self-serving criminal. There is just nothing remotely interesting here.#0
7297_2#From the opening dialog and scenes, I knew I knew I was in for a train wreck. Didnt want to look, but couldnt turn away. If it werent for the meer eye candy of this film, I would have given one star. The fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched, added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film. But this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound. According to Eli Roth, none of these answers are that far fetched. In fact, all are plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store. Stay away. Stay far away.#0
4320_8#This highly underrated film is (to me) what good writing in a movie should be all about. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at. The movie is about the divides people create to insulate themselves from the violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life.  #1
9079_1#What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so bored that I walked out of the theater. What is up with this stuff. I only laughed once and not even that hard. Whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this is crazy.  Slackers  makes  Not Another Teen Movie  look like a classic. It ranks up there with such trash as  Body Shots ,  Con Air , and  Conspiracy Theory  as one of the worst of all time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies, but to my dismay that wasnt happening. Looks like I will never see that money again or the two hours.#0
6390_8#Surprisingly well made little movie. Short in length at about 90 minutes. For a low budget movie, very well made. Plot is slow to unravel. Cast is excellent especially Elizabeth Van Meter as the girlfriend with Tourettes Syndrome.#1
2897_4#Theres little to get excited about  Dan in Real Life . First off, the whole setup is incredibly contrived. Did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant, Marie wouldnt have told Dan where she was going? And since Dan did all the talking during that conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? For that matter, I never figured out why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the movie. Hes very narcissistic and does little to convince us that hes truly a good guy (for example he lies to Marie in the bookstore, ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a blind date). Theres more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are caught making out by the whole family. Yeah like that could really happen. Dan in Real life is slow-paced, sappy and manipulative. Even chick flicks like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher marks than this predictable  tearjerker .#0
2222_4#Carlo Verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism. Severely disappointing under every aspect.#0
12070_2#I happen to have bought one of those  Legacy of Horror  50 movie pack collections and would you believe Im still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it. Sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like The Devils Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of the great Alfred Hitchcocks films (some arent horror however and are only on there because Hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense) but other times it seems that they put movies like The Island Monster and this on because they cant accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter. So we open up to sort of a Westing game idea. The rich yet cruel and abusive father played by Carradine (the one standing feature of this) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates. Carradine gives a good enough performance as always, but hes left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre/terrible performances. The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes. Given this was an independent film of the 70s the lighting and effects are pretty limited. Its hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer cant see whats happening that well in some scenes. Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga give an effort at least and Im ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who-done-it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film. You arent meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable. The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there. It proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack  Chilling  containing films like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of horrors with Jack Nicholson, and Night of the Living Dead over it. This is best avoided.#0
5365_3# Private Practice  is being spun off the fairly successful and well written  Greys Anatomy . The cast is fabulous. The premise might even work. But the writing is just terrible. I just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch. Not worth the effort IMO, and I would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season. Pass this one up folks.#0
6088_3#Why do I watch movies like this ? - other than I have some weird misguided masochistic belief that one day I will find a true gem amongst all this dross I cant think one one good reason. This movie was dross from start to finish - but semi-hilarious dross. Where else but in a bad Italian dubbed movie could you find heated exchanges of surreal mangled English like this one between a honest military type and the sinister chief of a secret X-files like organisation dedicated to hiding  The Truth  Favourite moment? When the Foley artists didnt notice that characters they were foleying (is there such a word?) were no longer walking on gravel but were now on the lawn so their feet kept on making loud  crunch! crunch!  noises. Other than that, another total waste of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they prove those UFOs have no bellicose motives soon#0
9144_7#Ok, so it may not be the award-winning  movie of the year  type-film (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think won a few awards), but it is a really great film about The Kid (Prince / O( take your pick) and the happenings around him living in Minneapolis, playing his music. The music is absolutely superb, in my opinion you HAVE to own this soundtrack, it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion. And the movie itself plays out a nice plot, its worth seeing over and over again, espeically if you like Prince / O (which I do) of course.#1
10921_3#I make a point out of watching bad movies frequently, and the sci-fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find. As such, Im sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands of oblivion. The acting was uncharacteristically sub-par, as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci-fi usually has in store for us. There are a few cameos made by people youd most likely recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. The CGI special effects are minimal, and as such, one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci-fi feature is lacking. Sure, there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl hes known for a couple of days, but overall, it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter, and I consider that a major disappointment. If I was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made-for TV movies, Id probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. A real shame that I may have to wait till the next sci-fi original movie to get a good laugh, and I really hope that this movie isnt part of some overall quality increase in sci-fi original movies.#0
12456_10#This movie is definately one of my favorite movies in its kind. The interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen. It treats themes like duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like few films have done and, unfortunately, none that I can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious, down to the essential, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. No such scenes are present or needed. The argument is sand honest to the spectator; An important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience. No, this is not miss Marble A note of congratulations for the music is in order A film to watch and savor every minute, not just to see.#1
7371_1#Steven Seagal.how could you be a part of such an awful film? I rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean. I have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one. Very, very poor taste! I am embarrassed that I even rented this movie. Steven, if you keep acting in movies like this one, I believe that your career is over. My husband and I have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can  get the bad guy  with a few hand maneuvers and make it cleanand also the language is pretty clean in your moviesbut this one is something else. I will think twice before I rent another movie of yours.#0
4330_10#  Bleak House  is hands down the finest adaptation of a Charles Dickens Novel ever put on screen. Alway one of My favorite novels,I was exteremely pleased with this Television Mini Series. The late, great Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book,oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story. over all a brilliant,moving and atmosphereic film.#1
5243_4#Make up your own mind. Personally I found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from Stevie Wonder. No offense Mr. Wonder. Maybe it is comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids; Wheeler(Seann William Scott)and Danny(Paul Rudd),two energy drink salesmen, to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny(Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie(Bobbe J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is Augie(Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies. Supporting are Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.#0
6915_9#Textbook example of an underestimated movie.

10636_8#This story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last Harem of the Ottoman empire, well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone, and learn about the people who lived there.

4694_10#If your a fan of Airplane type movies this is a must see! Set in the 1920s and 30s Johnny Dangerously has not only great actors but great lines.  knock down dat wall,knock down dat wall and knock down dat @$%@$ wall.   You shouldnt hang me on a hook johnny  or  Sounds like Johnnys getting laid . Its definitely a spoof of the old James Cagney Movies and references them a lot. Theres a great scene when Jhonnys walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape. Listen closely to the fake priests readings, its pretty funny. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Watch his reaction to Johnny after he tips the Pope, a lot said without making a sound.I recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs.#1
3468_10#I absolutely loved this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching the  Two of Us  took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what  might have been.  Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on. I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant. The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the circumstances.#1
3060_1#This has to be creepiest, most twisted holiday film that Ive ever clapped eyes on, and thats saying something. I know that the Mexican people have some odd ideas about religion, mixing up ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their Day of the Dead isnt half as scary as their take on Santa Claus. Along the way Pitch manages to get Santa stuck in a tree(uh-huh) from whence hes rescued by Merlin! Merlin? You have got to be kidding me! Since when do mythical Druidic figures appear in Christmas tales, or have anything to do with a Christian religion? And doesnt God disapprove of magic? Theyd have been burning Merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago, not asking him to come to the rescue of one of Gods Aspects(or thats what I assume Santa must be, to be going up against Satan). This movie is one long HUH? from start to finish, and itll make you wonder if that eggnog you drank wasnt spiked or something. Probably it was, since this movie is like one long giant DT.#0

10423_9#Yes, Be My Love was Mario Lanzas skyrocket to fame and still is popular today. His voice was strong and steady, so powerful in fact that MGM decided to use him in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. Having read the book by Kostelanitz who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary Caruso to Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did a superb job in the story, but the story is not entirely true; blame it on Hollywood! I used to practise singing his songs years ago, and became pretty good myself until I lost my voice because of emphysema/asthma ten years ago. Reaching the high note of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!#1

9354_2#There is a key aspect of film that Jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you. You dont need to tell the audience what to think, because theyll see it. The action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public - the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former. And it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals. Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support. And he may have been right, it lacks a basic credibility 70s Edinburgh wasnt exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath. From the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the cod intellectualism that tries to link it all together, its all too contrived for my taste.#0
5753_8#   1/2 Out of       While I am not concerned with the fact that this is an English dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted, as it seems to reside in many Quebecois native hearts. However, this was a movie as a child that I was a fervent admirer of; keeping in mind now that it was made for children, I rate it on a relative basis. The story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort, and jostling back-n-forth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions, as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons. If I had children, this definitely is a film I would try and get them interested in, as the snow fort wowed me when I was young, and I think even children today would agree, albeit with Pixar and all the computer animation, maybe I am out of date and just dont realize it. In addition, the movies message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that, for children (and adults alike).#1

10716_3#Near the closing stages of Baby Mama, one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess; I really couldnt say it any better than that. And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again, the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyones time. A lacklustre cast, mundane script and vague, caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isnt taxing on the ol noggin, but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour. Consisting mainly of very routine, cliché jokes based around an odd couple (rich and poor) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world, the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic. - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http www.invocus.net)#0
3972_7#In the tradition of G-Men, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name, now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While its 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, it would be showed in no other kind of light. Vera Miles didnt just marry Stewart, she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates. Its dated mostly, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.#1

The book was great. It was immersive and interestingly prophetic. But the movie just plain sucked. It is easily the worst film I have ever seen. The only reason I didnt turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two-part assignment for a class. It was dark and grotesque, but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere. The acting was nothing above average, and considering the fact that there wasnt much to act out, this was severely disappointing. The book, for example, didnt give me the impression that Winston was unable to blurt out more than a single syllable at a time. Boring, disturbing, and visually unappealing, the movie totally cannibalized the book. Wait a secondIsnt it British?#0
10029_10#Why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century.With great acting,directing,effects,music and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie, not only being the most heavily Oscar Awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies Ive ever seen. Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors but none match up to James Camerons Masterpiece TITANIC.#1
9448_7#This was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen. The first part of the movie, though strange, has a light and amusing quality to it. The journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of Appalachia. But that is misleading beyond belief. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the countrysides inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie. I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain, and I shudder at the thought. Lewiss leg made me wince. Yet, while the movie was, on the whole, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. When is it moral, or right to take another individuals life? What can morality drive us to do, or not do, in some cases? And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions one may draw from the film, it is an achievement in its own right (despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome).#1
3239_3#Ah, the infamous  Guinea Pig  seriesI honestly have to say that Ive been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ( He Never Dies , Mermaid in a Manhole , and  Flower of Flesh and Blood  being the exceptionsand even those arent great by any means), but  Devils Experiment  just plain blows. There is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to  hideous  (more often sometimes  hilarious ) tortures.  Flower of Flesh and Blood  is a more violent and gory depiction of fake  snuff  material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and theyve really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in  extreme  film-making, but  Devils Experiment  just doesnt hold up. Worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and thats only for the needle-through-the-eye scene#0
8059_1#This film concerns a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman. One night Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and Cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him. As Cassie was driving, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a bloody loss of lives along with her boyfriend. Cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has nightmares which cause her to have hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are, who wants her dead and will she survive this entire horror ordeal. Cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love. This is a way out film, and not very good at all.#0
10801_1#Now, Im one to watch movies that got poor reviews, and say,  Hmm this isnt so bad!  I loved The Cable Guy, and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep in mind, I really didnt start watching this with high hopes, but I figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way I could laugh at it. I was wrong. At no point at all during my suffering through this  film  (And I use that term sparingly) was I even close to being mildly entertained. To start, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I could tell, an Amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him. The main character is simply annoying, and not a character that its easy to like. Quite frankly, I would rather eat a greasy turd out of a Harlequin fetus bloody sores than watch this again.#0
11353_1#Today, I visited an Athenean Cinema with my two kids (6 & 8 years old), payed 3 x 12 euros (about 45 US $ total) not to mention gas, popcorn & soda, was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was  forced  to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick  cold war like  propaganda movie, like none I have seen during the last 20 years AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN IN HEAVENS NAME!  PS 3 3D animation is fantastic but who gives a . #0
9121_3#This is not an all-around terrible comedy, but it is very DULL. It has barely any laughs, and it wastes its lavish production values. There is one poignant moment near the end, when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his  nemesis  and tells him that  Youve been my one worthy adversary; and now we can start all over again . That scene, however, along with Burt Kwouks amusing cameo in the beginning, are the only memorable parts of the movie. ( 1/2)#0
11018_1#I purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, but the movie is trash. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. Surf Nazis Must Die is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just bland bland bland. Incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. This movie has very little to offer.#0
6981_1#How they got Al Pacino to play in this movie is beyond me. This movie is absolutely terrible. I discovered, after reading some of the other reviews, that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film, which deeply puzzles me, because I do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as Revolution. Its not just that its a bad movie, with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant, but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded (which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does, though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards) or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible. For example, we see Donald Sutherland running around with a huge, fat ugly mole on his face. He does not normally have a mole. The mole does not add to his character. It is extremely ugly and distracting. Its not like Robert De Niros mole; its much worse. Why the hell has he got that mole? Its as if the filmmakers just said,  Lets see, how could we make this movie even worse than it already is? I know, lets give Mr. Sutherland a giant, ugly-ass mole right on his face.  Im not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldnt watch it; its so bad that you SHOULD watch it, just to see how badly it sucks. Its terrible, terrible.#0
9806_1#I cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the childrens television show, power rangers is all about. Oh, and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway?#0
8760_2#This film concerns purportedly non-establishment types (aesthetically and sexually) who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players take part, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant, and Cynthia Nixon, they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue; which isnt. Nixons role possesses the best lines, but she often homes in on them too quickly, a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director. The grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche, spent or not, and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy.#0
9540_8#Most of the feedback Ive heard concerning Meatball Machine has been pretty mixed. A couple even saying that they think  it sucked . Well, to those people I say, get some f@ckin imagination and go f@ck yourself. This was a very entertaining flick. Going into Meatball Machine I was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions, but it turned out being a great surprise. A few unanswered questions, some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points I can think of. From the anime feel to it, to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel, this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses. With a ever-developing story thats interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make-up effects and blood splatter, this is one flick fans of bizarro/horror/Tetsuo/splatter fans should check out. 8 outta 10#1
6961_2#I completely agree with the other comment someone should do a Whats up tiger Lily with this film. avoid this film, if you want to laugh watch an Alain Chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like LA FILLE DE DARTAGNAN.#0
1046_10#Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but its not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like  dressed-up midgets  than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, theyd all be  up  for this movie.#1
11962_7#I was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of Scoop last night. Full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause. I didnt speak to anyone who disliked Scoop although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film. They were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves. Very good performances all around in my opinion although I found myself missing Ian McShane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough. Hugh Jackman is great as the charming nobleman and I think Woody Allen has found a new regular star to work with in Scarlett Johansson. I think that with Match Point this is their second pairing and shes just magic with the material that Woody gives her. Could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! Im glad I saw the movie and definitely recommend it. More sophisticated comedy than movies like Scary Movie 4 so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former, Scoop probably isnt for you. If, on the other hand, you like a touch of class, sophistication and fun, Scoop is for you. Probably not the Woody Allen film Id introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try.#1

8581_10#This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as absolute sh t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and  ficticious  action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like  Theyre Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars.  #1

7488_1#Anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast, script, and director can put together a comedy masterpiece. By the same token, its easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid Hollywood bore-a-thon! This movie was pathetic! Had it not been for John Cleese (a comic genius), I would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid. Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a wonderful job in the original, what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one? How could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny? I dont know, but one thing I do know---its no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular.#0
1492_10#Mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story. Everyone probably has one, and this is writer-director Yasmin Ahmads story of hers, with a boy called Mukhsin. We know that her movies have been semi-autobiographical of sorts, having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences, and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen, that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty. Mukhsin is no different, and probably the most polished ad confident work to date (though I must add, as a personal bias, that Sepet still has a special place in my heart). Another highly recommended movie, and a rare one that I feel is suitable for all ages - bring along your kid brother or sister #1
1549_2#While Leon is cute on SNL, hes only on for a minute. Like most SNL skits-to-movies, this one cant fill 90 minutes. It has some cute moments (the ones youve seen in the trailer) but the actors are largely wasted. Tim Meadows does his best but the plot just doesnt have many high points. Will Farrell has a bit part. Farrell may be the funniest man alive but not in this movie. What a shame.#0
4670_4#This adaptation, like 1949s  The Heiress , is based on the Henry James novel.  The Heiress , starring Olivia de Havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to James original story than this new remake, which retains James original title. It is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter (Leigh), devoted to her father (Finney) after her mother dies during childbirth. The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. When a young man (Chaplin) of good family and little fortune comes courting, the Father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like shes acting through gritted teeth. Shes not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly  its just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. While the character garners a lot of sympathy, shes not particularly likable. The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin (previously seen in  The Truth About Cats and Dogs ) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. Finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? This is only one instance where  Washington Square  differs from  The Heiress . Another instance is the ability to stick with it. It is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet, offering too little story in too long of a movie.#0

93_10#My first child was born the year this program came out, and I played the record album for the boys every Christmas thereafter. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start familiesit invariably becomes their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (made on DVD-R from video tapes, probably) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was an excellent copy, and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both the CD and DVD will stay in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.#1
10102_1#If ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating its this pile of crap. I love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity. I actually began to feel angry watching this film because its so insultingly poor, I cant believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable. 0/10 and thats generous.#0
7483_2#One would think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese, a movie should be, at the very least, decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time. I tried to enjoy this---I really did. But The Out-of-Towners ultimately fails miserably. If you really want time-efficient entertainment, just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet. Just please dont watch this movie.#0
2538_10#There are so many good things to say about this “B” movie. “B’ maybe in connections, but not in commission. This is about the best of its genre that I have ever seen. A grade A effort by Universal. The script is well done, imaginative, and without fault. Writing credits Howard Higgin original story & Douglas Hodges story, John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well. No skimping on the loads of extras and locations. I loved Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewarts mother in “It’s A Wonderful Life”. The fem lead, Frances Drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her Karloff husband. Lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. I think this is the best part I remember seeing him in. As I said there were so many good things the African discovery of the Radium “X”, the melting of the stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians in And Then There Were None (Agatha Christie) (the Barry Fitzgerald version)), the glowing of Karlof in the dark. Karloff’s mother played by Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance. And because of all these virtues, I found myself believing in the science it portrayed. I guess that’s the mark of a good piece of art.#1
4829_8#The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. On the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront, director Jean-Marc Vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victorias story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. Its a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare. - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http www.invocus.net)#1
1040_10#Outstanding film of 1943 with Paul Lukas giving an Oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to America from Europe as the Nazi menace deepened. A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a wicked foe.#1
5665_4#This wilfully bizarre adaptation of Borges short story is typical Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast. The film is definitely in the surreal tradition of Bunuels Mexican period, and looks at times like a poor mans take on Lars Von Triers Elements of Crime. Coxs apparent preference for single takes, jump cuts, and ambient sound recording all work against the films effectiveness. Worth a look but ultimately disappointing.#0
2746_4#I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie, as I didnt think it was going to be well done. The kids, ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it, so I caved. I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought, but was still a far cry from the book. The movie seemed right on with the 10 year olds understanding and sense of humor. I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place. I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies dont show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the  silly  or  stupid  choices.#0
2168_1#Having read another review, I thought this movie would actually be good. I do enjoy the  B  movies, but this couldnt even be classed as such. The photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie. But the editing left much to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job. The music was awful, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting. If the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off. Unfortunately, Ive seen better acting in porn flicks. If you want to see a  B  vampire movie, check out Blood Ties. Youll be much more entertained.#0

With beautiful music throughout the movie, the sounds and music can make you feel like youre in the movie! This movie is not just great for kids, but adults too. It teaches you lessons, such as never forget who you are, you can do whatever you stick your mind to, and to brave and daring. This movie can make you cry at times too, which is always a nice touch in movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute, and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them, and the movie  Spirit  is definitely one of them! With my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music, and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a whole lot of Spirit #1
12276_7#Can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal, which was to correctly adapt Allendes novel? Obviously yes. Bille August managed to make a superficial, shallow film where basic elements of South American mentality are presented simply as side events, resulting in total incoherency. I cant believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! There is of course technical quality in this film and I think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. And this something was the most important part.#1
6656_2#This gets a two because I liked it as a kid, but it became so redundant that I just started to hate it I cant give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other, I probably wouldnt say anything that everyone else didnt say already. The only other thing about this show is that its pretty nasty, with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it. I have a cousin that loves this show and hes the strangest and dumbest person I have met. This show should be pulled from the air. Its always the same thing over and over They need to put better shows on Nick. Im getting really really tired of stuff like this.#0

7330_8#This movie is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters are straight out of his paintings (the Death Dealer being the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art. Bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope (the technique of tracing a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. However, since the subject of the movie is quite realistic (all characters are humans), this works pretty well. Definitely recommended!#1
7660_1#0 s Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. Based on the video game director Uwe Boll attempts to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly he doesnt succeed. Instead he makes one of the worst movies ever MADE! Even though he gets minor celebrity such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line, and some basic relativity of whats going on in the dark and the light. The movie bounces all around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used on making the monsters. Even though they did look cool and the feedings were well, a little lame. Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating 0/10.#0
11874_10#Arguebly Al Pacinos best role. He plays Tony Montana, A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with the only two things hes got in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesnt breakem for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the bosss sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tonys young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalmas Brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes The one at the fancy restaurant ( Say goodnight to the bad guy ). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies its a must-see. For the rest of you its highly recommended. 10/10#1

The only funny parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money. The writing was awful. It had every terrible stereotype of Hispanic people who should be utterly offended. The movie wasnt that long but to us it seemed like an eternity. The people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry. I made my husband stay because I was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts, but there werent.

Horrifically re-produced from the original Spanish,  The Fury of the Wolf Man  loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form.

This was a pleasant account of a true story, although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie, (ie, Billy Sundays character was three or four people in the real story combined together.) Robert DeNiro was of course good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr., was also impressive.#1

Certainly not the makers of  Fido,  who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950s where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the familys new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to  life  by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This is what  Lassie  might have been had Timmys best friend been afflicted rabies.#1
2501_1#I saw this on TV the other night or rather I flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when I couldnt stand watching it any longer. It was bad. Really, really bad. Not  so bad its good  just flat out bad. How did it get funded? Who thought this was a good idea? An actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasnt good enough to play a bad guy but I think what they meant was  save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of @$%.  I bet the rest of the cast had been given the option. To be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake American ascents. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was awkward and stilted. The dialog was inane. By far the saddest thing was ship. In real life the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesnt scrub up well. Instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls, I kid you not, they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. Dont watch this movie, not even as a joke.#0
12274_3#Im usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short. Well, if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.#0
4566_1#SPOILER WARNING There are some minor spoilers in this review. Dont read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film. Theres so much wrong here. As mentioned, the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses, which these kids are not. The website, the cartoon image, the computer chip, even the stuff they are being taught in school, are far too advanced for these kids. The acting by most of the cast, especially Kevin Kilner, is terrible. Some familiar faces are wasted. Dom DeLuise plays the evil bank owner, but his part is a throwaway. He has one good scene with Alexandra Paul (who shows she has the ability to act) in which he explains his motives, but nothing more. And Rich Little is wasted in a small role as a judge. Theres even some offensive and uncalled for anti-Russian jokes. But the greatest atrocities are the hard-hammered themes. These themes show up in many of The Disney Channels films, but never before have these ultra-conservative messages been pounded so strongly. The typical `overworking parent idea is really pushed hard, and after delivering it inappropriately in `The Ultimate Christmas Present, seeing it again sours my mood. Family relations are important, but Disney must stop this endless preaching, because working is important to maintaining a workable family, too. Except for cancelling activities thanks to work, the father didnt come across as that bad, but I found it offensive when the grandmother told him `I dont like what I see. Just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents MUST marry if they want to raise their kids right. Enter Alexandra Paul, whose character, while important to the plot, is there solely to be the love interest for the father. This offensiveness only proves that the Disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the Disney script barrel. Instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud, wait for the next Disney Channel movie. It has to be better than this. Zantaras score 1 out of 10.#0
8311_9#I really liked this movie, it was good, and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many other classic singers, is very good at his job, when you see him in a musical movie, you know that it is going to be good! I would suggest that people watch this heart warming, sad, and special movie, if they want to know more about Richard! Outstanding! Fresh!#1
5287_1#I have no idea why they made this version of  Persuasion  when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose that they wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; alas, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the lovely wit and humour, leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores. It was ghastly.#0
7345_1#I absolutely hate this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage?? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure Im well out of the room before it comes on. Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago??? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.#0
10775_8#Nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation, it describes life in a small village near Correggio (hometown of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie), it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world. It reminds of Trainspotting, with a bit of Italian touch.#1
11886_10#I loved this movie. First, because it is a family movie. Second, because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of HIV in a family, with far less hysteria than what I have normally seen in the movies. The brothers are very close, yet are not judgmental. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but not needed in the end. I understand that Leos choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people, but I believed it was the right choice for him. I cant believe that this was a french television programme. It had great production values. I gave this movie a ten, and I think you will too, once you have seen it.#1
10879_1#Lame, lame, lame  A 90-minute cringe-fest thats 89 minutes too long. A setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility (an abandoned convent) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky, witless dialogue thats straining oh-so-hard to be hip. Mostly its just embarrassing, and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat (a sample of this movies dialogue after demonstrating her artillery, fast dolly shot to a closeup of Barbeaus vigilante charactershe `any questions? hyuck hyuck hyuck). Bad acting, idiotic, homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects, it looks like the directors watched `The Evil Dead way too many times.  I owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes theyll never get back. What a turd.#0
2728_10#Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks adaptation of Truman Capotes non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (that should have won an Oscar), a haunting Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly-matched killers. This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasnt even nominated for Best Picture while Dr. Doolittle was. Go Figure!  Although you dont get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake a close second. Highly recommended!#1
7194_1#In keeping with Disneys well-known practice of stealing.. I mean.. buying out known properties and bastardizing them, this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re-makes in a year of bad re-makes. I grew up on the original cartoon TV series. Any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie. Not present is Pennys cool computer book. Also not present is the gag with the self-destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the Chief. New are a smooth talking Gadget convertible (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic Hollywood romance. Dont fill the coffers to pay for Disney executives and even their _ex_executives - dont see this movie. #0
5982_9#One of my favourite films. It has everything - rocking soundtrack, courtesy of Eddie Clark, ex Motorhead, loads of action, loads of laughs, totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful 80s stereotypes as characters. Eddie, the put-upon nice guy, who just wants to be left alone to be different, Leslie (about as wet as they come), Nuke (the rock burn-out), Eddies Mom (pathetic), Roger (the geek) and Ozzy as the preacher (surely he exists in America?). Then there are the boys (rich, vicious and stupid) and the girls (vacant, vain and stupid). What more could you ask for? If you were into rock in the 80s or just love ridiculous films like I do, then check this one out. Its available on DVD and very cheap so (trick or)treat yourself.#1
2777_7#To some, this Biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation Others see it as a story of grace, restoration, and hope It is actually both  Henry King illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his downward spiral of sin, and his upward climb of healing.. With superb color photography and a masterly music score, David and Bathsheba won Oscar nominations in the following categories Music Scoring, Art and Set Direction, Cinematography, Story and Screenplay, and Costume Design..#1
10944_1#Now, Ive seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. Ive seen (and enjoyed) all of Jean-Claude Van Dammes movies, including the one where hes his own clone, both of the ones where he plays twins, and all three where hes a cyborg. I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, hes got a great ass and you almost always get to see it. With DVD, you can even pause and zoom in!) Thats why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad, it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane. It didnt help much, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron Palillos cameo as a gay arsonist.#0
8028_1#Please! Do not waste any money on this movie. It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school kids. I couldnt finish watching it, and usually I like watching all kinds of B-movies. How on earth could they find a distributor for it?  Funny however Check out Wikipedia for  dark area . The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got loads of money from the producers. Money that should have been spend on actors, camera and editing. Even that wouldnt have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately  dark area  has already gotten too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, STOP making movies like thatyou are not doing yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this film.#0
3123_10#This is the first 10 out of 10 that Ive given any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there isnt any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesnt try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. theres no forced romance). Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!#1
697_2#The two things are are good about this film are its two unknown celebrities. Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.#0
8127_2#Currently, this film is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst film ever made--which is exactly why I rented it from NetFlix. However, I am saddened to report that the film, while bad, is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list. I have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one. Hardly a glowing endorsement, but it just didnt meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list. NOTE For some reason, IMDb shows the graphic for the three DVD set for ITS ALIVE and its two sequels of the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE. While THE BAT PEOPLE has been seen with the title  Its Alive , the two movies are not at all related. Its easy to understand the mistake--especially since they both came out in 1974, but the movie I just reviewed starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.#0
8561_3#The Cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle. Definitely not one of Johns best movies. Dont get me wrong, with any John Wayne move there is always some good spots. And this one has its fair share. But over all the picture moves slow and just doesnt live up to the aspirations it could have been. Bruce Dern again does an outstanding job as the villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better. This would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers. This would be a good family move to watch with your children. Just be aware, there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it. But most kids that I know who have seen the movie like it. Maybe its because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work.#0
5417_3#Three Russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of Monte Carlo, despite the fact they are down to their last franc. In order to support their lavish lifestyle, the three use the services of a counterfeiter, and use the notes at the casinos, hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, a US envoy, arrives at Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three decide to make pals with the visitors, hoping for financial assistance. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to go further, with continuous advance towards Helen, while disappointing the Counts maid, who loves Sergius. Eventually, circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats. Its obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the foolishness of American women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats), rather than tell a story, and the film really can bore modern audiences, like me, easily by doing that. Even the acting, which is great in later EvS like Greed and the Wedding March, is just run of the mill here. The film could have used improvements on various levels. Rating, 3.#0
10412_8#The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure. First and foremost, it is a good story. Though my four childrens primary exposure to this tale, the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights, comes from the Disney Corporation, the Thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end. The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of todays teen actors in appeal, judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say,  Hes c-u-t-e!   All in all, a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.#1
2746_10#Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night, and then going to bed. Theres no need to lock the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway. Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room. Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act,  In Cold Blood  stages in riveting detail a real-life story that still hypnotizes, nearly half a century later. Its that setting that does it. Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked  at night?#1
11771_1#This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, though for reasons best left to the powers that be. A lot seems to have been made of the fact that its the first Thai language film, made with Thai actors & crew, but directed by a westerner. Neednt have bothered to be honest, as this film is dull, dull, dull. Why hint at something, why shroud an idea in mystery, why subtly invoke a feeling, when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs, obvious shots and over the top scenes> Nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director Spurrier clumsily churns out endless clichés. No hinting, no guessing, its all up on screen, no need to use our imaginations. Wonder when the scary bit is coming? No you wont, cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating, rising to a crescendo of ominously. Hell, Im making up words to describe how bad this is. Wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - its really is a snake, and yes its really is biting his crotch, and theres blood splattering everywhere. its a strange, uneasy film for several reasons. Its supposed to be a horror film, but its not scary - the jolts are signposted & obvious. It might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of Thailand, yet the director has a sleazy, lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens. Maybe it was casting himself as the virginity-taking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe the whole thing was just pants. Uninspired, insipid, repetitive, hackneyed - all candidates for best description, but dull seems most appropriate and honest. Its all been seen before, probably better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or flare. Sorry. Thumbs down on every count. Truly dire.#0
4353_9#So fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the Palm Springs International Film festival. Upon entering the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film. Looking at the card I turned to my wife and said,  How many movies in your life do you think you can rate as superb? Only about 5 for me.  But then watching the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while viewing the spectacular scenery in the films setting of New York state, I slowly starting bumping the movie up a category at a time. Certainly it was good but the totally natural repoire of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing detective rather than this film, the movie jumped to the excellent level. This picture is a must for anyone who has parents. No violence or nudity but some strong language.#1
10083_7#The fact that this film was put out on DVD still formatted-to TV and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film puristsand rightly so. This deserves a lot better treatment. Overall, its involving story complete with drama, suspense, humor and sadness. Just dont expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the DVD. Until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.#1
5873_1#i dont know what they were thinking.by they,i mean anybody even remotely connected to this disaster.ive seen so bad movies,ive seen so really bad movies,and then theres this.but i will say one thing.whoever wrote the script has manged to put what could possibly the most inane dialogue over written,onto the screen.there is nothing good about this movie,either from a technical standpoint or any other standpoint.whoever allowed it to be made and then released should have been fired immediately.there are a few fairly well known names in this movie.actually i hesitate to use the word movie.its more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less than 0 sense.anyway,i fail to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this.i got it really cheap,and i still got ripped of.even if i had gotten this movie for free,i would still have been ripped off.this is an absoluter 0/10#0
10170_8#In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised. Sure, you arent going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time!#1
1835_10#What a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe. i dont know how come the rating of the movie is 7.3 it should be 9.3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by Akshay is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect. you should watch this movie once, i think twice well its up to u. Anyways i love this movie and its not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one of the best movie in the bollywood history. but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya. the only thing i dont like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if A R Rahman would be the music director but anyways we cant do anything about that so ya.#1
3050_9#This is simply the funniest movie Ive seen in a long time. The bad acting, bad script, bad scenery, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter. So its not gonna win an Oscar but if youve got beer and friends round then you cant go wrong.#1
4046_8#Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution. One always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary. If you can put aside Rohmers unabashed defense of the monarchy (and that is not an easy thing to do, given that, for instance, the French lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts), this is actually an elegant, intelligent and polished movie. Lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century France, Rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards. It is a blatantly artificial conceit, but it somehow works. And newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldnt be.#1
7198_9#This is a really good film and one that Ive enjoyed watching several times. Michael Caines awesome as always. Michael Caine has received kind of a reputation for taking any role in any movie no matter what the quality or lack of same but he does a good turn in playing Sidney. From the start its so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin who wrote such creepy stuff as The Boys from Brazil and Rosemarys Baby could write something this witty. Lets face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by Sidney Lumet. Im really reticent to go on because if anyone were to give away anything about this film it would be a crime. Just watch it and adore it.#1
8313_2#I watched this on a whim because it was available and Id heard the Thumb movies were funny. This one was not. The majority of the jokes were based around  Geraniums  physique and, in turn, Kate Winslets. I think its really pathetic of the the  Thumbtanic  creators to stoop so low to make jabs at a respected actress just because she (heaven forbid) doesnt starve herself into the model of ideal modern beauty. My favorite part was the line that goes something like,  Hey, I have a great idea! Lets swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!  Thirty seconds of amusement out of a 26 minute movie does not redeem its value.#0
8402_4#The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical? Perhaps  Rockin in the Rockies  was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical, in a matinée; if so, this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and, Mary Beth Hughes (as the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as the brunette Betty) are pretty women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are quite tuneful; however, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film doesnt exactly  rock . There are a few laughs; but the Stooges brand of humor is more subdued than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized.

735_8#Marvelous cult film from 1979 in which the students of Vince Lombardi High School are confronted with a new, dictatorial principal named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music hater and blames the musical tastes of the students for their transgressions. Leading the charge against her is fun-loving Riff Randell (P.J. Soles), the 1 Ramones fan who, more than anything, wants the rock group to record her songs. 8/10#1
11589_10#Man, I loved this movie! This really takes me back to when I was a kid. These were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reel-to-real and if you were good, they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward. I still remember one of the opening lines. Tutazema was his name, and he was an Orphan. He lived with his sister so and so in the village.  This is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon. At the end the other Indian boys in the village attach the feathers to Tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself. He gets to live the way he always wanted to. He gets to soar the heavens.#1
7031_10#This is a great movie, I did the play a while ago. It had an extra zing-- to it. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and also Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was great. The setting were also very good. Except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, makes it pretty long. Overall I give it 8.5 stars. They also added a few parts, but it was still cool.#1

9758_4#I tend to love everything the great late Paul Naschy (R.I.P.) ever was in. While not all films starring Naschy are great, they all have a specific charm that can be found nowhere but in Naschy-flicks, and they are always entertaining. There is no rule without exception, however, as  El Mariscal Del Infierno  aka.  The Devils Possessed  (1974) proves. While the film does have the specific Naschy-flick-charm, it sadly drags far too much and gets really, really dull in-between. Naschy stars as the evil Baron Gilles De Lancré, who oppresses the people and uses black magic and bloody rituals to stay in power. When Gaston de Malebranche (Guillermo Bredeston), who fought side by side with Gilles De Lancré against the British, learns about the Barons evil behavior, he decides to turn against his former comrade in arms and help the people free themselves from the satanic Barons tyranny Directed by León Klimovsky, who is best known for directing Naschy in  La Noche De Walpurgis  ( The Werewolf Vs. The Vampire Woman , 1971), the film was scripted by Naschy himself. Naschy often scripted his own films, and one must say that he mostly did a better, more original job than it is the case here.  El Mariscal Del Infierno  is mostly built up as a historical adventure rather than a Horror film, and it gets quite boring throughout the middle. It often resembles the Sword and Sandal films from the 50s, only that this film is set in medieval times. The Satanic part was probably only added because the great Paul Naschys name is linked to the Horror genre. The film has its good parts Paul Naschy giving weird speeches, Paul Naschy looking weird, Paul Naschy doing Satanic stuff, Paul Naschy torturing innocent victims, etc. But sadly, most of the film concentrates on the boring hero and the good guys, and these moments are boring. The female cast members are nice to look at, but, unlike most Naschy films, this one features no nudity and sleaze. There is some gore, but it mostly looks clumsy and isnt as fun too look at as it is the case with most other Naschy films. Overall,  El Mariscal Del Infierno  is only worth a look for my fellow Naschy-enthusiasts. There are dozens of films starring the Spanish Horror deity which should be seen before this one, such as  El Jorobado De La Morgue  ( The Hunchback of the Morgue , 1973),  La Orgia De Los Muertos  ( The Hanging Woman , 1973),  El Espanto Surge De La Tumba  ( Horror Rises From The Tomb , 1973),  Latidos De Panico  ( Panic Beats , 1983),  Rojo Sangre  (2004), or any of the Waldemar Daninsky werewolf films. R.I.P. Paul Naschy. Legends never die #0
8604_3#Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic  The Warriors ) is the first person in the community to realize that theres murderous slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isnt that frightening, but I digress). No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will. DVD Extras Merely a theatrical trailer for this movie#0
2221_1#Im sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just doesnt hold up. The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and doesnt pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then its too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isnt much to her. Im sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemarys Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I cant believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars, for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating.#0
12169_1#This is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage, that no doubt wants to be a Friday the 13th (1980) clone. The poster for this movie makes it look like theres going to be some sort of a cross between Jason and Freddy, which is likely to attract movie-goers. There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie. It just makes me sad, just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers (1988) on video or DVD, and waste their time with this sad, cynical, depressing movie. And the sickest thing is--and by not giving too much away--the movie simply sets up room for a sequel. Well, why not? Theyve probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies. I missed out on the original Sleepaway Camp (1983), and, after watching its first sequel, I will hopefully stay away from the other sequels, as well as the original. And for parents, if you know kids who actually LIKE this movie, do not let them date your children.#0
15_1#This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people..theres just no comparison. Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.#0
5523_1#Georgia Rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp,  what?  out loud at least 7-10 times throughout its grueling two hour course. And if you must, get sufficiently drunk before hand.#0
7595_1# Ask the Dust  looked intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all of the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama, and it wasnt funny enough to be a comedy. It practically seemed to satirize itself, and to no entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and I walked out, valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense. It simply was not interesting, moving, funny nor artistic. It appears as though it were written, produced and directed by a high school kid; worse yet, it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.#0
8923_3#Much like Orson Welles thirty years earlier,Mike Sarne was given  the biggest train set in the world to play with,but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe. Despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract,the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today.How anyone given the resources at Mr Sarnes disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret.Only Michael Cimino ever came close with the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes  Heavens Gate .Both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least Mr Cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studios largesse,whereas Mr Sarne had only the rather fey  Joanna  in his locker. Furthermore, Heavens Gate  could boast some memorable and well - handled set - pieces where,tragically, Myra Breckinridge s cupboard was bare. Simply put,it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of Hollywood.#0
11620_4#I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this , God that and Christ is our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line did not need it. If , as I am , you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been.#0
3491_1#Apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called  movie.  They described  blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence.  I saw no  intrigue.  I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. I saw no  violence.  At least, I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with  impervious  skin--but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the  plot.  Furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable. Whatever you may choose to do, I will always remain P.S. I was not blinded by the choreography.#0
3455_2#Geez! This is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didnt. I mean, you didnt give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind. Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it wasnt enough.#0
5102_7#dont mind the soundtrack, which is played out by now. Worth seeing for Debra Winger; she is still so likable, and never had that Hollywood persona we are subjected to by too many actresses today. 7/10#1
708_4#The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. RiChard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I cant say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. Hes one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. Im currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but Im glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too real  for me. I prefer Lestat and Louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I dont want to give anything away) Sorry, but its just not my type of show.#0
6429_7#If the movies are to be believed, Chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their Western counterparts. The storylines of the three Chinese Ghost films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that its not a huge problem. As always, humour is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of mugging. For those who havent encountered the Chinese GhostStory trilogy yet, this film offers an interesting departure from the Western horror/ghost genre; for those who have, another enjoyable romp in the Chinese ghost world.#1
3742_1#It is so rare that I get to rate a movie without having some reservation as to whether I should have gone up one or down one but this one..Did the explosion rate a notch higher, or one down because my brain hurt trying to CREATE a plot. No, THIS ONE.yeah, a solid, no brainer..ONE/ten#0
9294_4#As someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of  Hero,  I was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines, but better. It also featured an actress I like Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed on both counts. I bought the DVD of this film sight-unseen, and that was a mistake. It was not better. Despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - to me - just didnt have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning. This film is no  Hero  of mine #0
8699_1#Carnosaur 3 is bad awfully bad. Bad to the point where it is funny. How matter how much I try to convince myself, I just cant believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons. I mean, come on, even the cover is bad! OK, the special effects are absolutely ridiculous. Those  Carnosaurs  are really ridiculous. A scientist tells the soldiers that they move incredibly fast, yet when you see them run, they run at the speed of an actor in a rubber suit trying to run as much as he can. And the explosions are funny(there is no other word to describe it). At the beginning, a bullet hits a Jeep AFTER a guys says  What was that?  And the other explosions are also laughable. But the worst thing is the screenplay and the so-called story. You dont expect a good story(or, I dont think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie) but at least the story has to try to make sense. I mean, how hard is it to make a story about dinosaurs killing people at least coherent. Incredibly hard if you look at this. Oh, and if you think that its easy to makes believable commandos as your characters, tell it to the writers of this awful, awful piece of crap. I mean, what sick human being would make cheap jokes after one of his buddies is dead? And they do lots of it. And if you think that a movie about dinosaurs killing soldiers can only be at least action-packed, WAKE UP  This movie is incredibly dull. The carnosaurs(who invented this lame name anyway?) attack(in boring action sequences where you dont see much happening). The soldiers think of how to beat them(in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but cant seem to convince even just one second). So, then, they attack the carnosaurs, but their idea doesnt work(another laughable action sequence). Back to planning(with a few lame jokes thrown in) in another ridiculous scene. And this goes on, and on, and on. And lets not forget the acting which is about as convincing as the special effects and the story Oh OK, this movie simply sucks from A to Z. #0
1409_4#Not really spoilers in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, nevertheless. As the executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 Items Or Less, a movie with an intentional indie-feel, and just be absorbed in the mentor/be-all-that-you-can-be theme. He plays a alternate universe, semi-washed up version of the real Morgan Freeman, who is chauffeured in an old Econovan by a kid all the way into Carson, CA from Brentwood to research his next movie role. Why Carson, is a mystery to So. Cal residents. He could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. Paz Vega is pretty to watch, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for Moragn Freemans research. His character is only known as  Him  to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people- Psst, thats him, etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted that Him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in Brentwood, carried no cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. If one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like Him does, then I gotta see cash and a Blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which Him definitely has. Nothing really happens in this movie. I dont believe that either of the main characters were substantially changed by their encounter with each other. It flirts with the idea of adultery, but then that thought fizzles. This to me was similar to Steve Martins Shopgirl, without the sexual affair. It was self-indulgent for Freeman and unconvincing to the audience.#0
8913_9#This is my favorite classic. It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia, PA when I was 13, in 1957, and released the next year. Then in 1970, I found myself working the very same county as a rookie PA state trooper. I have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well, and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the  home of the blob . The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and it is still showing films today #1
5015_1#As a movie critic for several Dutch websites, I have to see lots of movies, and not all very good ones. Some movies are so bad, you wont be surprised that they are released straight on video. With taboo, Iám surprised that it is released on video at all. This is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish.  Some of the actors have played in bigger titles before, so why on earth did they sign up for this? If you see this anywhere, try to dodge it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this movie.#0
10571_8#James Cagney is best known for his tough characters- and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot soft characters in his career. This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney would star in. 8/10#1
141_3#This stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre. A masked killer stalks young, pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways, none of which are particularly inventive. Its not scary, its not clever, and its not funny. So what was the point of it?#0
5197_10#This movie completely ran laps around the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes a movie great..except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson couldnt do it alone and you KNOW that! LOL) I admit that I have killed my first video tape of this movie and I plan to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This movie has so many catchy lines its pitiful! I am embarrassed to say that I know the theme song backwards and forwards! I love Jimmy Lynchs character to death, and he should have won the Best Supporting Actor Award in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were NEVER ready for this! This is a random film consisting of Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Editing, and of course martial arts. (Being that its the 70s and I can say everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters!#1
8945_10#this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story. the obvious inspiration behind the successful TV series  Bewitched,  this lovely sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. the comparisons are obvious. jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid  straight.  kim novac plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell. but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch, she contents herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved pyewacket (her feline familiar) is being cared for by her beloved aunt. youll recognize the aunt from  Murder by Death.  this movie is fun and touchingly sweet, bearing some spectacular wit and a nice witchy feel. worth a look.#1
11492_1#How can a major German TV station broadcast a mess like this? Its amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - Even the well-known Gottfried John is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateurish.! The screen plan is very , very extended - perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The set is obviously very often a blue screen, f.g. the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background! In the German version the sound and the dubbing is very poor - probably reason different languages of actors - but other international productions do handle this much more professional. Advice Do NOT watch - its a diabolic waste of time!#0
11612_3#Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time its a film thats played for ermlaughs. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, but he fails miserably, in this ham fisted vanity project. The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a dither head, who likes bending over is front of the camera, Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. Theres even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by  real men  for  real men  to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality, its a shameful shambles.#0
4849_1#I just rented this today.heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW  What a pile of steaming poo this movie is  Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back???? Finally someone bumped  Stop-loss  from the Worst Iraq War Movie Ever number one spot. To be fair, I dont think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY bad.  Im pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot sucks, characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best. Its ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because its the biggest bomb Ive seen this year.#0
10410_1#This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. That is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it. There are some interesting shots and ideas, I must admit (such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin), but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinders self- indulgence.#0
88_2#I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, theyre all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didnt seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; theyre both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.#0
2714_4#The 60s (1999) D Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry OConnell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The films first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Duttons character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).#0
746_1#Save the $8.97 youll spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go see the real film by Steven Spielberg. I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film-making or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead. It would be easier on the eyes.#0
3498_1#I had just watched one episode of this program and I couldnt even get to the end of the program. Every minute I had watched this program my I.Q must of dropped about 10 points. This is basically like a childrens program but with swearing. Not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh. Anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded, disappointing, horribly acted program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons.#0
1727_10#The Wooden Horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by British POWs during World War II. It is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are marvelous as the two heroes. The direction is taut and fast-moving throughout. Highly Recommended.#1
11527_7#Miriam Hopkins is  The Lady with Red Hair  in this 1940 biopic of Mrs. Leslie Carter which also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and a fine cast of supporting players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. Not a bad movie, probably not a depiction of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carters most famous moments was in The Heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot tresses. Off-stage, fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing. Quite a visual.#1
6828_10#Broadway and film actor-turned-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemarys Baby)creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there is a cameo by Peter Falk. The premise of the film An aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands)re-evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. It has a 60s cinematic look and it even reminded me of Polanskis Rosemarys Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are the ones every successful actress has- she is getting old and she will become useless in her career. Furthermore, she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity and merit. She has lived only for her career- she has no children, doesnt do charitable deeds, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She is falling apart. Shes in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the characters tormented psyche and acts the part quite well. She is a terrific actress and this 70s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. Its a movie with lots of deep-seated emotion but has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70s generation. Either that or this movie is a product of the 70s which was itself cynical in many aspects- Nixons deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values are not great, and this film is not well-known, its a very haunting film with haunting moods. Kudos to the underrated and late director Cassavetes who died in the late 80s.#1
2752_7#Though the plot elements to  The Eighth Day  seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormals first film had. Though not as good as  Toto the Hero , which will always remain on my favorites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from 2001s flavorless  The Closet  downplays his part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the characters growth. Dont walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from  Toto the Hero  because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent, if not flawed, movie#1
8824_8#A woman, Mujar (Marta Belengur) enters a restaurant one morning at &35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant & is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film, which I only saw by finding it on the DVD of the director/writers equally fascinating  Timecrimes . It had a fairly catchy song & it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short. Im glad that I stumbled across it (wasnt aware it would be an extra when I rented the DVD) and wouldnt hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friends. My Grade A-#1
9830_2#Im afraid that youll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly Christian. I am not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this film. If you are looking for a good general movie, Im afraid youll need to go elsewhere. I was annoyed by the characters, and their illogical behaviour. The premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was Jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong. One scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who taught us this. I find that offensive are we to believe that  thou shalt not steal  came from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And stealing was acceptable before that? I rented the movie from Netflix. I should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments. Oh well.#0
6010_8# Zabriskie Point  (1970) This was especially interesting to me on a personal level, since it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life  the Counter Culture movement of the late 60s/early 70s, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories, who are slowly woven together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless, pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus, and, the other, a young woman driving to Phoenix to see her father & employer, and take on an  establishment  job. The film is FULL of our Italian directors (Michelangelo Antonioni) visual notations of America, and, the confused, psychedelicrazies of that eras self-righteous,  we know it all, well change everything for the better  youth. Just who IS the  revolutionary ? What does that REALLY mean? Do you dress like one and march around chanting? Do you  fly in under the radar  but give advance notice of your arrival? Do you keep your plans to yourself, and go about the business of change, with no need for group approval?  Zabriskie Point  is definitely a  period piece  - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal film moments (after all, this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing  Blow Up  of 1966), and the eras artifacts, but it is more. It presents options for cultural revolution, and going by Antonioni (who DOES seem to be supportive of it), the youth are too self-involved to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to anyone, any time, any place.#1
5047_8#Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling, dark, and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders, claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but  demons , and that they have been selected by God to destroy these  demons . This is all told in flashback by one of the sons, now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) to skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). 8/10#1
2365_10#Jeff Wincott is not only a Hunk, he can kick butt! This movie has some of the best Martial arts moves Ive seen in a very long time. Ok, so maybe Bridgette Nielson isnt the first person Id hire to play a ruthless politician, she did a GREAT job nontheless! And lets not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by Martial arts expert/stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So shes not Cynthia Rothrock, Who CARES?! Shes just as good, if not BETTER! (just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie, one word OUCH ). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you havent seen it, youre really missing out on some great martial arts action.#1
11039_8#Now this is what Id call a good horror. With occult/supernatural undertones, this nice low-budget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene. This proves you dont need wild FX or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie. I thought his was a very good movie, 8/10#1
2406_10#this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like. most movies show jesus as being effeminate, lobotomized, or tortured. this jesus laughed, played, and was serious when it was necessary. this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to, not the usually hollywood version. it seemed that the movie was researched well. one example was the offhand comment to a teenage boy who was called  mark.  it is believed that mark (or john mark) was the boy referred to at the garden of gethsemane whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked (mark 1451). i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate (even in spirit) was much as possible.#1
5283_7#The premise for this movie is simple and so is the script an elderly Muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station wagon from France to the haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that he can fulfill his holy Muslim obligation before he dies. The father is clearly devoutly religious, but the son is unimpressed; he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion, hed rather be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesnt understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often rather irksome. However, like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way; for example a woman on a backroad in Croatia who upon being asked for directions to Belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but cant find it on the map. In Bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak French but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor - in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slaughterman ritual. They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican but on a much grander scale. For westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating. The movie isnt sophisticated but is charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with soul.#1
8208_2# Hey everybody! Ive got an idea, we found this egg-shaped thingie from outer space so why dont we thaw it out and open it up?   Yes, I know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race, but hey, I want to know whats in it .  And nobody tell NASA, they might take it away from us .  Wow this thingie gives off vibes!   Yes,really strong ones on contact so dont touch it but its okay to cut it open .  Hi there handsome, check out my nips . (Later that day);  DO NOT OPEN   Uh oh, we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we dont have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here.  Ive never seen such organic technology!   Yeah, lemme take this stick and stab it. .  Im getting out of here, I dont care if I do kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, nobodys nukkin me!

9098_10#Domestic Import was a great movie. I laughed the whole time. It was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations. The acting was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman, and all the others did an awesome job. Because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer, it doesnt have the clichés that are expected of other comedies, which was such a relief. It was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story. I heard it was based on a true story? If so, then that is hilarious (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.#1
3308_8#The Power of Kangwon Province is director Hong Sang-Soos second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film, including the multiple connected narratives (in this case, two), and stories of troubled or troubling relationships, as well as a potent dosage of irony. Power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion, regret, longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision-making. Its a rather hard balance to keep and its surprising how Hong manages to pull it off twice in a row. Technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear. This film doesnt pack the same emotional wallop that the first does, but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision. Great viewing for art cinema lovers. 8/10.#1
11228_10#This is short and to the point. The story writing used for Star Trek Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Acting is all over the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid-May 2007. If this was being ranked as a professional production, I would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets. However, as a fan-based production I have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts, this is in a league of its own. For sheer volume, I dont think this has been matched. Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire.#1
12290_1#I and a friend rented this movie. We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging. The movies plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending. We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot.#0
10986_1#When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film, I was intrigued. Being a fan of the book, I assumed shed be playing Tony, Roz, or Charis, but more so, I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y, almost psychological (but not psychological thriller) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadnt read the novel, and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had. The book is a complex reflection of society, women, and modern life, and I was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film. What they actually did was a crime. Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of?#0

417_7#This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him. This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. This movie starts out with Lincolns assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home. This movie also deals with Custers last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually dont like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.#1
9454_1#When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it is bad. I wanted to claw my eyes out. I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to  unwatch , if only it were possible. The other films being Troll 2 and Fast and Furious, both which are better than this crap in the hat. #0
1303_2#Edward Montagnes Tattooed Stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor. Instead, its a poorly acted, witless look into low budget and uninspired film making. The plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish. John Miles, who had a rather thin resume in the industry, grins and guffaws throughout, and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government-made filmstrip about driver safety. The movie anticipates shows like Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best in its unnaturally wholesome view of New York in 1950. Why, the viewer doesnt even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie. The only thing the movie has going for it (besides its brevity) is the excellent location shots coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film works in the cinematographers favor, as the viewer is treated to well-framed shots of New York Citys interiors and expansive exteriors. Unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles, I suggest watching practically any other movie.#0
1852_9#Knowing what to expect (on the whole) from a Denzel Washington performance - quality, integrity, gravitas, wry humour - will prepare you for what to expect from his directorial debut. Much like Robert De Niros A Bronx Tale, Antwone Fisher delivers the moving drama of the life of a young man and the effects of key figures in his life. Much as in A Bronx Tale De Niro played one of these key figures to the lead character (himself a character was born to play but was too old too) Washington takes a similar role in this as the fatherly councellor to the titular character - a character that seems like he should be played by a Washington from 20 years ago. Be thankful Washington is too old to play Antwone because if he had we would firstly be deprived of the wonderfully measured and intelligently nuanced performance he gives as the Navy councellor. However more importantly we wouldnt get to see the superb, we can only hope star making, turn from Derek Luke in the title role. Inevitably the character comes across as moulded in Washingtons shape, however you get the impression this is not just because Washington directed it, not that Luke was trying to copy him, but that Luke is as genuinely powerful and thought provoking an actor as Washington. It took far too long for Washington to receive the Academy award he deserved for Malcolm X, Philadelphia, Devil In A Blue Dress and The Hurricane, let us hope that Luke does not have to wait so long. Also a great piece of casting was Joy Bryant as Fishers girlfriend, Cheryl. While the part could have been a forgettable support or a standard girlfriend role Bryant imbues it with life. Tender and intelligent the role transcends stereotyping with Bryant inhabiting it, and she makes the part significant and interesting. It doesnt hurt either that Bryant is possibly the most attractive woman youll see on celluloid this year - the smile alone could thaw the coldest heart. Acting ability and looks - why isnt this woman in everything being made right now. Providing good support in a small role in Salli Richardson as Washingtons wife Berta. Saying more with a silence or look than many Hollywood actresses can manage in an entire film she informs the audience of the entire storylines long before any exposition occurs. As for Washingtons directing, as I said, it is the directing equivalent of his acting. Taking the story of a man few viewers will have heard of and making it genuinely interesting is a difficult feat which Washington achieves with aplomb. The film is neither rushed nor showy, but it never feels slow or dull. It is measured and nuanced, balancing the humour and drama perfectly. Antwone Fisher may not blow you away if you like big, explosive, plotless Hollywood films but for those who appreciate a finely crafted character piece, with excellent performances and steady well handled direction, this is for you.#1

11717_4#A lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in Leon, then other parts felt like some other movie, I dont know which, but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie. It was kind of nice to watch, but it would have been fantastic! if the story would have been more original. The theme little girl, bad assassin from Leon, is just tweaked a little. The opening scenes are really good -) It is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the movies -) My biggest problem was to remember which parts was from Leon, Nikita and if they where from the French or American version. If you have not seen Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. Best Regards /Rick#0
5736_2#This is one of the worst films Ive seen in years  You could randomly pluck 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film. Absolute waste of time watching it. I only gave it a 2 as I like gory films but this is just plain rubbish. The acting (and I use that term VERY loosely) is abysmal, someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film?? Dont waste your time watching this. Hostel was a better film by some way. I cannot believe that someone has spent money making this, I hope for the producers sake it only cost $50,000 to make - it looks like a school project, made by kids who havent got a clue. Did this even make it to the cinema??#0
11214_7#This was the first  Walking Tall  movie I saw, I think in a $2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd. , so I didnt have any reference to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked at the corrupted system of McNairy County and the brutality of the  redneck gangs . I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided hes not going to let it slide, and went out to do something about it. Courageous ? I thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine. A  classic  that Im sure will resurface again in the future.#1
9132_10#Ill start by relating my first encounter with Princes music. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to  1999  playing on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I was told it was Prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful, topless dancer. Later I started hearing other Prince songs and really  digging  them. When Purple Rain came out I still knew very little about this fellow Minnesotan. The movie blew me away. I instantly became Princes No. 1 fan of the  War Baby  generation. Later I found out one of my cousins was his secretary, and she got me, and my nephew into a V.I.P. Prince concert where we sat next to his motherhow cool is that! Getting back to the topic at hand, I agree with Siskel & Ebert who called Purple Rain an instant classic. I have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it. I thought Princes acting was fine, Apollonia struggled a bit, but all in all the acting was fine. John Gielgud was not available to play The Kid so Prince took the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly paced (it never gets slow), and terrifically directed. I rank it among the Best Movie Musicals of all time. The last time I watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered. I am so proud of fellow Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and would love to tell him personally. He walked right in front of me during the above mentioned concert and said,  Hi , to my nephew but not me. He was chatting with his mom. I was a bit crushed but hes still No. 1 with me.#1
6581_1#I rented  New Best Friend  hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as  Gossip  and  The Curve . Instead,  New Best Friend  is much more like  The In Crowd , in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony.  New Best Friend  is boring, and the events during the movie are the same. Skip this movieits a waste of time.#0
2183_2#This film was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous.  The Brain That Wouldnt Die  s best achievement is its short running time.#0
4718_1#There are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that  One other thing. I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country (Bosnia) that had connections with Bin Laden during the war. Well, first of all, all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims didnt have an old ethnic identity (previosly they were called  Muslim Croats ) they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people, and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common Their religion. And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them. They had to fight the 4th largest army in Europe! They needed all the help they could get. Nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war. History has shown us that.#0
10547_1#I dont remember a movie where I have cared less about where the characters have come from, what happens to them or where they are going. I realize that Hollywoods greatest pastime is navel-gazing, but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with. For what its worth, though, the discussion that followed the showing, under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series, did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics. I disagree.#0
3109_4#This movie wasnt awful but it wasnt very good. I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid. The book is great and he cantt believe a kid wrote it. Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you dont know if this kid really exists or if shes making it all up. I am not gonna ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary. The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD.#0
11528_1#Whoever wrote the  nice  post about this must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for backyard wrestling. In fact this isnt even backyard wrestling really, its a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline. Each guys is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this. It is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name, if that is possible. If you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling, pick up Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. It stars the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as  real  pro wrestlers. They went legit and have gotten better. I recommend checking out those 2 guys. MDogg is insane and off the hook. So dont waste your time or your cash on this crappy DVD, there are  better  back yard videos out there.#0
3474_2#This thing is horrible. The Ben Affleck character is self-centered and gleefully sadistic--punch-you-in-the-nose fratboy sadistic. And hes the romantic HERO! His cartoonish character does not change from beginning to end, but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness. We capitalists like a little Christmas magic from time to time. This aint magic. I dont know what it is. Its just awful. And its a horrible waste of talent. OHara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late 70s. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underused. If Ben was out of the equation, these folks might have dreamed up something excellent.#0

6511_10#Like many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here who did, I love this show! I think that it has been very well done and thought through. Everything about it marks it as a spin-off which isnt meant to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy. By using the well known Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode. Well done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the cleverest cartoons in a long time #1
8238_1#This film was positively the worst film I have ever watched. I couldnt sit through the whole thing. I also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping I mean what was that all about! I cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have ingwasted a £4 rental fee. The quality both picture and sound are terrible, the acting well doesnt exist . It was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh. AVOID AT ALL COST! The girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos theyd be willing to take their tops off While these girls have nice bodies it certainly didnt make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears. Definatey not one to buy folks. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money like I have.#0
7770_1#This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. As I was nearing the end of The Cold I came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that 60s shocker. The story  such as it is  is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games. Whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win $1,000,000. Its a very simple plot but Rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten about. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Weirdly. I mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly? I guess you are left to draw your own conclusions. Production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard. In truth Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) isnt even that good. She is so unbelievably terrible shes compelling. Sadly the same thing cannot be said about this crap-fest as a whole, its just a bargain basement rotter.#0
6287_4#I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman, who one day sees herself drive past in her own car. Well, I thought, this could be interesting After watching the movie twice, I still feel unsatisfied, a little confused maybe, and not in the E. A. Poe or Stephen King kind of way. Do yourself a favor, and dont watch this one. Simply put, there are better thrillers out there.#0
4824_2#I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. The use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head, but it did make me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting. I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, but this film couldnt decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.#0
1720_10#This early Biograph short was so much fun to watch. The second on disc one of D.W. Griffiths  Years of Discovery  DVD set (highly recommended) it features three excellent performances by the main leads, and interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as a campy musician giving a Countess the eye (and other things). The Countess husband goes berserk at his wifes betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour. Its kind of incredible that they wouldnt hear the wall going up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (father of silent player Raymond Hackett) gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. The best moment comes at the end. As the lady passes out from shock and fear, once she realizes shes doomed, Henry picks up his instrument and  fans  it over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and I just lost it, and laughed my head off. The expression on his face! From that moment I was charmed by Henry B. Walthall.#1
10165_3#San Francisco is a big city with great acting credits. In this one, the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city. They didnt even manage the most basic of realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie. You will not be thinking  oh, Ive been there,  you will be thinking  how did a two story firetrap/stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby?  Some of the leads used East Coast speech styles and affectations. It detracts, but the acting was always competent. PS, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.#0
3152_2#Poorly structured, badly written, loaded with cliches and flat dialogue. Not a single scene shines. The actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises, plot twists or conflict. You know from the first ten minutes where its going. Steven Feders big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie.#0
2969_3#The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. The main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. But after all its a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.#0
10183_7#This is probably Karisma at her best, apart from Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives out his best, without even trying. The story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture. What really made me like it were the performances of the leads, the dialog delivery, as well as the story, for what it was. It couldve been directed better, and edited. The supporting case was even great, including Karimas mother in law, even though she just had one shining moment, it was great to watch her. Overall, I would give it a thumbs up!#1
3071_9#Panic delivers the goods ten fold with Oscar caliber performances from William H Macy, Neve Campbell, and Donald Sutherland. In a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with. Chillingly Honest and thought provoking, Panic is easily one of the best film to come out of Hollywood in years. The impact stays with you right after you leave the theater.#1
11586_9#Someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing Paul Naschys  Fury of the Wolfman  to the great Spanish surrealist films,  Lage Dor  and  Un Chien Andelou . The Naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end. Dali and Bunuel probably loved it, and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off. 9/10#1
12121_4#Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing.  A Walk on the Moon  appears to have borrowed from other, better made films. The present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class Jews not far from Woodstock. The screen treatment by Pamela Gray doesnt have much going for it, so its a puzzle why Mr. Goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction. Watch it at your risk, or pop the DVD in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh, or two dishing the film.#0
6822_2#Drones, ethnic drumming, bad synthesizer piping, children singing. The most patronizing  world music  imaginable. This is a tourist film, and a lousy one. What really kills it is the incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc, etc. No transitions, no visual explanation of why were suddenly ten thousand miles away, no ideas expressed in images. Just a bunch of footage of third-worlders with  baskets on their heads  as another reviewer said. Walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World music video, all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were shot, and film in Mexico. That would have been a much better setting for  life in transformation.  RstJ#0
1710_2#Every once in a while, a group of friends, with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm. Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and pals succeeded with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project. Normally a film this bad would get 1/10 for me, but, in celebration of Jerry Angells flowing locks, I will generously raise my rating to 2/10.#0
5442_3#Aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot, this movie wasnt too bad. Unfortunately, that doesnt leave much movie not to suck. Do not waste your time on this film, even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia, as I did. Watch an infomercial instead.#0
10714_2#For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was awful. Fast forwarded it and never got any better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought that she would be so great in the comedy. The previews were so great, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a chick flick, it sucked. What is up with that. Movie was very slow ans boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like my money back for this one! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant. I thought that it was going to be so funny, I have had my own children and I have helped others have children. It could have been more along the lines of reality.#0
10994_1#Sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one. You can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back. I will now look at Michael Clarke Duncan with apprehensionwhy.he lent his name to this vermin.#0
6203_7#A wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she seems. The story is very tongue in cheek, and the dialog skillfully understated. Hints of humor and intrigue, neither of which overpower the characterization Posey pulls off so well. The supporting cast is stellar. The downside? This film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes. Posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body. Shes worth your time, even if you dont understand the denouement.#1
2077_2#Needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried - left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry. This review is base only on the first hour - it might have gotten better. I just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on.#0
3691_8#The whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts. No problem. This film features a line-up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast. The segments are devised around the same theme,  Love in Paris , but the resemblance ends there. Actually, considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms, it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film. No great effort has been made to turn it into a comprehensive whole. This buffet has so many great ingredients, I am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish.#1
4245_3#This movie was based on actual fact? I sincerely hope not! 3/10 for the fine editing.#0
3918_10#Passionate, dramatic, riveting as Flamenco itself, the film is simply amazing. It is set on the immortal Bizets music. The original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists, leading proponent of the Modern Flamenco style, Paco de Lucia who plays a musician with the same name. Legendary Flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades co/wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the celebrated Georges Bizet/Prosper Mérimée novella/opera. He plays a main character Antonio, the famous dancer/choreographer who works on retelling the story of Carmen in the Flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hand clapping and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers. As in the opera and in the novella, Carmen in Sauras film is desirable and deadly, the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else. She could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to submission. There some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen, and as different as they are, they all have in common the only possible tragic end. Saura/Gades film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly Spanish. I fell in love with it from the first time I saw it over twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back then. Highly recommended.#1
9159_10#Playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor, paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers  not to mention the numerous other actors whove besieged the castle before. Fortunately for the fantasists, this version  with the nicely cast Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton  stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it. Its the right length to do the story full justice, and makes considerable use of Brontes cracking dialogue; none of that modern meddling away, cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes. Not so long ago the BBC aired an excellent dramatisation of Jean Rhys enlightened and most unsettling riposte to Bronte,  Wide Sargasso Sea , imagining the back-story of the first Mrs Rochester. Do check it out  youll never see the hero of  Jane Eyre  in quite the same way again.#1
11298_8#The Ruth Snyder - Judd Gray murder in 1927 inspired Ogden Nash to write a Broadway play called Machinal. More famously, it inspired James M. Cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with - Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Both became film noir classics of the 1940s, Double Indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made. Some of the real-life elements of the Snyder-Gray story were captured by Cain - the old age and indifference of Albert Gray, Ruths high sex drive, Ruth and Judds passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause. Missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban Manhattan - Albert Snyder being a respected newspaper editor. The numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase. This is a far greater study of the working class than of crime. The audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime. The drifter is a complete tramp, the wife is no Lana Turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage. Her husband is an obscene capitalist - obese, rude and arrogant. I think the casting was brilliant for this film. My only beef is with the overlong running time. Everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical. Nevertheless, fans of noir and realism will definitely like Ossessione, as I did.#1
2366_4#I am a fan of the Nightmare series but this one is horrible. The deaths are so trendy. If you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated. I did like the flashbacks. I think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive. That would have been more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. Depends on how much spare time you have.#0
4857_2#I really liked ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problem with extremely low-budget movies, and I have enjoyed movies with worse production values than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing. check out wiseguys vs. zombies, if youre interested). Indeed, I prefer lower budget zombie films, because I am suspicious that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are about. 3. Despite the epic exposition, there really wasnt a plot. And the exposition is indeed epic! I wont spoil it, if youre going to watch it. (Dont watch it.) But then, its just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for ~80 minutes. or fewer, if you so choose.#0
9852_7#No day passes without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects. After watching Ice Age I felt thats it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre. Overall its a nice movie, but its rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche. If you dont hate cute animals making funny things, watch it at least once.#1
7721_7#A flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a forbidden planet. What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in. Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring roles. Unfortunately, Nielsens performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). Walter Pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. Ms Francis, Earl Holliman, and the amazing Robby the Robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. The problems with the featured performances, I think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. Though they certainly got most of the film quite right.#1
6967_7#A prequel to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series, from the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eick as well as new series co-creator Remi Aubuchon. Caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of Battlestar Galactica. The new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the Cylon race. Like Battlestar Galactica this series is filmed in Vancouver#1
6046_2#This film is basically two hours of Dafoes character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you didnt have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was just a grim, sad waste of time. I generally dont like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others, even when they suck, but this film warranted one. Its just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result.#0
7224_3#The movie remains in the gray for far too long. Very little gets explained as the movie progresses, with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch. It sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way Im going to do that. It is that I watched this movie in the morning, Im sure of it that if I watched this movie in the evening I would had fallen asleep. To me the movie was like a poor mans  Blade Runner . 3/10#0
3909_2#When I found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof!But I had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and I still have the bruise.First of all the character that Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admire even after this disappointment)plays was just awful. He treated his family like crap, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and Im no prude, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down. Wynona and Antonios characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate. And what was with Meryls character and her  mystical powers ? Why didnt they go into this more? This film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.#0
3274_8#This is one of three 80s movies that I can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately, still overlooked. One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a movie horribly overlook due to Salvas legal/sexual problems. Another would be Camerons Closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated--not great, but not nearly as bad as the reviews Ive seen. Paper House is well worth your time and I think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years after Ive seen it and I still give it some pause, whereas something that I might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether.#1

981_7#Sterling and younger brother try to survive on land, being squeezed by big cattlemen. When rogue brother Preston arrives, a moral dilemma ensues. John Drew Barrymore steals the show as the younger, impressionable brother-Barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse. Moves at a nice pace to an exciting climax.#1
1583_1#I am a big fan of Stephen King. I loved The Running Man. So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a film of it. And when a local network showed the film, I was in heaven. I was all ready for a night of fun! (Note that I used someone a lot. I did this because Im sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and I dont want to embarrass them even further by naming them here)#0
3578_7#12 year old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him (or feel it is not the right thing to do). His ONLY refuge is his grandfather, who is the ONLY one who seems to have compassion on him. The Realism will captivate  true-2-life  movie lovers, but will not satisfy those that desire action & thrills.#1
6282_4#If the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate, everybody involved in this production would now face approximately 170 years of bad luck, because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here. If only the script was as shattering as the glass, then  The Broken  would have been a brilliant film. Now its sadly just an overlong, derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences. Sean Ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie, but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating. I got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and  meaning  of the film. He thinks Ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how youre going to die. Interesting theory, but Im not familiar with this legend and couldnt find anything on the Internet about this, neither. Personally, I just think  The Broken  is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of  Invasion of the Body Snatchers  but without the alien interference.  The Broken  centers on the American McVey family living in London, and particularly Gina. When a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration, this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events. Gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building. Whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion, she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital. When dismissed, Gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing. She doesnt recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes. Does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her? Writer/director Sean Ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script, but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them.  The Broken  is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort, but only after just half an hour of film, you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package. Theres a frustratingly high amount of  fake  suspense in this film. This means building up tension, through ominous music and eerie camera angels, when absolutely nothing has even happened so far. By the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in, these tricks dont have any scary effect on you anymore. Some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly Sean Ellis style with the repertoires of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick and even Alfred Hitchcock, but that is way, way  WAY too much honor.

10648_8#What can I say that hasnt been said about  The Haunting ? It has everything that would make a great picture. Wonderful sets, moody music, and sound design to die for were all in place. The screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way. The entire team must have forgotten to read it through, maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was. Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance, although with little conviction to the material at hand. Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her. But thats about it. All I can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours, but you will definitely want more. A lot more.#1
5422_9#The story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands, is told in the 1939 film  Gunga Din.  Based loosely on the Rudyard Kipling poem, the film is brilliantly directed by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The title role is played by Sam Jaffe, well known in my era as Ben Caseys boss, Dr. Zorba, a name that became synonymous with big, out of control hair. Say  Dr. Zorba hair  to anyone of my generation, and they know what youre talking about. This is truly the ultimate adventure film, massive in scope, with good acting, rousing scenes, a wonderful musical score, and some beautiful cinematic images. Another one from that remarkable year, 1939. Highly recommended.#1
2274_9#Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, Im not particularly interested in spy stories and I didnt know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw  Breakfast of Champions  and  Hotel Rwanda . But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesnt open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages.  There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it real different from average American movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.#1
660_1#Good grief I cant even begin to describe how poor this film is. Dont get me wrong, I wasnt expecting much to begin with. Lets face it, a PG-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away.  Lots and lots of closets big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets youll not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this movie should have just been called  CLOSET , and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of  what the f @! did we just waste our time watching!  #0
425_10#I would like to comment on the movie April Love. Its one of my all time favorites because my father, Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and lo and behold he came home w/the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park. Its very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w/all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus#1
6339_7#The part of The Grinch was made for Jim Carrey and I was extremely impressed with his performance. Not being a great fan of his I was apprehensive but pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the cutest little girl I have seen on the screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills. I was even drawn to tears at one point! Ive never read the Dr Seuss book of the tale so I didnt know what to expect, the humour was quite dark. Overall,I enjoyed the film (apart from the songs!) and would recommend it, for family viewing especially.#1
2955_1#Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friends dinner party, and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion going on. People just look at her and say,  Oh what would YOU know, you were the star of Theodore Rex . How could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap? Even little kids would be cringing in horror at this Thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of Sigmund And The Sea Monsters. Actually, come to think of it, Sigmund was vastly superior to this. And however did it get made? By plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it? Watch this hideous abomination at your own peril.#0
11998_9#This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable imagery, good acting, and touching subject matter. It would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental, but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the storys unfolding and presentation. There were a few cheesy shots, but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can conjure is there wasnt a ton of details. However, this movie wasnt created to explain every element of Joseph Smiths life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures etc.; it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time.#1
4706_1#Thats right, you heard me this movie is a freaking ABOMINATION. First off, the band, who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called  THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND ?!?! Not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians, they cant even play anything! Also, the lead singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is horrible! Not only are they terrible musicians but theyre terrible actors. Led by a crappy director and thin plot, this has got to be the dumbest movie ever. I wish this website would let you use a vote of ZERO OR BELOW out of 10, because giving this filth a 1/10 is being WAY too generous. Im not sure that you can call this a comedy film. If youre looking for comedy with music, go to that  Weird Al  Yankovic guy cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens.#0
2472_10#Kenneth Branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of Shakespeares most classic and well-written tragedy.

4989_8#This is very dated, but thats part of the charm with this 1933 movie. You can say the same for most Pre-Code films; theyre just different, and usually in an interesting way. The story is a little far-fetched but - hey - thats the movies. This story is about two lonely Great Depression victims trying to survive in a  Hooverville -type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale.#1
9517_2#Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time; Meet Me in St Louis, The Bad and the Beautiful. I awaited this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment.  There is nothing going on in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in The Best Years of Our Lives. And either of two Inge products, Splendor in the Grass and Picnic covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town, with much more poignance.#0
757_3#My children watch the show everyday that its on. Its a great program for younger children. However they need to stop showing re-runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of Rooneys and Deedees YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only Doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 dont ever brush their teeth? Does the show ever make its way to the United States and if so where can we find its schedule at. And one other thing if we might be able to add. Moe you need to stop hiding so much. Sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope? What does that signify? other then getting wet all the time. They need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole. Kids loose interest that way.#0

7674_10#I had the privilege of watching  Holly  at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12 yr old Vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) comes into Hollys life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately searches for her. We follow theyre difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunion. Holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day. The movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line. I walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can I help? This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore.#1
9633_2#Is rich, ailing Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she just overreacting--or more precisely, overacting--as usual? Actually, both are applicable in director Joseph Loseys wandering, meandering mess called  Boom , appropriately titled since tempers in the lush, luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylors mountain uninvited; she dresses him in a samurais robe complete with saber. Though great-looking in widescreen, the picture is otherwise quite deadly, a failure even Liz n Dick-philes should shun (the stars collective  what the hell!  attitude to their late-60s film careers reached an ego-mad nadir here). Pointless, confused, and maddening,  Boom  is a catastrophe--although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play  The Milk Train Doesnt Stop Here Anymore , was said to be quite fond of it!   from     #0
10338_9#Norman, Is That You? was (this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen. Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theater cant have been that great. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good.  But the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did his/their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed. And, its a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, Im told. Still, its vintage Madame, and shouldnt be missed. People are still stealing lines from Wayland; the man was truly gifted. Enjoy the movie #1
11370_1#This video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. Its a pity that the people who did it really believe that American people is so dumb to believe in it, perhaps, as an American citizen, every person must protest against this kind of crap. If you want to know the truth about Islam, dont let nobody tell you THE QURAN IS PUBLIC! you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say its true or false To end the comment I would like to make a reflexion Dont you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world?#0

But before you reply, ask yourself Would think so highly of this movie if it was set in England or America?#0
8530_1# Her Cardboard Lover  is Norma Shearers last movie. She quit the movies and, I think, joined the Board of Directors at MGM. That was a good move on her part.  Her Cardboard Lover  was talky and boring in parts. It was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat.  Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the superb  Escape . The same comments about this movie can be said of another movie,  Personal Property  that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too talky, boring, and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor, so in 1937, she died at age 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.#0
8016_10#Dont think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it. Its a strange mix of a movie, as its seems to have a movie within it, but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films!) It does give you all the elements of a film (decent plot, good characters - well it does star the Muppets, a list of lesser celebs  which films would clamour for) What is surprising, is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some heartwarming, some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together.   The celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine Miss Piggy #1

6098_10#This is one horror movie based TV show that gets it right. Friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies. Poltergeist the legacy Im not so sure. It may have been loosely connected to the movies. It feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it. The acting lacks but believe it or not the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie. This show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie. i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents. I watched a lot of R rated stuff as a kid, so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more movies came after the series , so it wasnt a total loss.#1
7194_7#I rank this the best of the Zorro chapterplays.The exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play.There is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter.Reed Hadley does a fine job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last,but certainly not least,is the great directing team of Whitney and English.#1
8531_3#In this forgettable trifle, the 40-ish Norma Shearer plays a fluttery, girlish socialite in Monte Carlo, caught in a tussle between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame this movies failure on the dull, talky script, or director George Cukor, who never seems interested in livening up the films generally comatose state. Mostly, though, its the fault of Shearer herself, who desperately wanted to keep playing  young  parts as long as she could get away with it. Inadvertently, this makes  Her Cardboard Lover  a bizarre monument to an aging womans vanity.#0

6027_4#I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I no longer believe the story. Ill give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is sappy, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced  nuclear  as  nu-cu-ler,  just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the  nu-cu-ler  incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I didnt find it here. If youre looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - its good for killing a rainy afternoon. But if youre looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.#0
11489_10#If youre looking for a Hollywood action packed kid-flick with the common bad language and violence this may not be the film to sit down for. If youre on the other hand interested in watching a film with youre children that has actually some values like showing the importance of friendship and truth this is the film to watch. Looking at the program guide this is obviously what millions of other viewers have found. Not many low-budget independent films have ever been aired as much as Mr. Atlas. The film is actually very funny as well as warm hearted and shows some beautiful locations masterfully captured by the sharp eye of the obvious brilliant cinematographer Suki Medencevic. Also if youre interested in looking at a muscular fellow with good looks the ladies can get an eye full. Lets support those who make good childrens film buy buying their videos and watching their products on TV. Enjoy#1
1881_7#As drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood. As it turned out, the role fit Moore so perfectly, it trapped him as an actor as well. Many disappointments soon followed (including this films pale sequel), yet that doesnt diminish the charm or appeal of this picture, which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moores drunk scenes are forced, parts of the film are wobbly, but the cast performs with so much relish its a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Oscar-winner John Gielgud a sly, dryly amusing role as Arthurs valet, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. Liza Minnelli (as a blue-collar love-interest) is sassy in a low-key and Moore is brash, but deft and lively; he never shook off the shadow of Arthur, but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish.     from     #1
11955_7#Allow yourself to be transported to a different, old school kind of storytelling. Scoop is classic Woody Allen. If anything, consistency is what the 70-year old Allen is all about. He continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always has; as if hes never been exposed to modern film-making, which is probably what makes his quiet, simple films appealing. They never seem to aim for a specific market; as if Allen makes movies to his taste alone, whether the public likes it or not.#1
10909_1#This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the storyline sucks! There is maybe one funny joke, it is stupid and it is boring. Through the whole short movie, I was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end. The writer and co-producer of this film is a Simpsons TV writer, but this is nothing like The Simpsons (this movie sucks )#0
7841_4#I thoroughly enjoyed A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played like a typical sequel. Everything about it -- budget, script, plot, casting, and acting -- was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe, looks nothing like an Indian, and neither do half of the other  Indians,  who were played by Italians, Mexicans, and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors. He even used the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a superb job in the original, seems to be coasting this time around. I guess he couldnt resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as Horse. To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as Horses undergoing a painful purification ritual to  find his vision  and rally the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but on the whole, Return is uneven, boring, corny, and predictable -- just like most sequels.#0
12491_2#Hm. While an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes, point out atrocious acting, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), Severed ranks among the worst Ive ever seen. Im never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. All in all, I dont really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion (which I cant remember anyway).#0
3660_10#This obscure de Sica delivers the goods. And it is said  the meek shall inherit the earth.  This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words,  Once upon a time  to exemplify the timelessness of its tale, for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all. De Sicas most accessible picture is also one of his best. Abandoning neo-realism, he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making, he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias  Gracias #1
3645_8#A fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at Doing something about them when the chance strikes. Nothing was easy for Morris either-he had a family, job, job opps elsewheres, a mortgage, etc-it wasnt like he could just drop what he was doing and blithely hop on the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took guts. I am glad that they showed his indecision, almost up til he got the callup to the majors.     outta     who woulda thought that the Tampa Devil Rays woulda been the subject of such a good movie early on?#1

2002_7#To a certain extent, I actually liked this film better than the original VAMPIRES. I found that movie to be quite misogynistic. As a woman and a horror fan, Im used to the fact that women in peril are a staple of the genre. But they just slap Sheryl Lee around way too much. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a more fully-realized character, and the main bad guy is a gal! Arly Jover (who played a sidekick vamp in BLADE) is very otherworldly and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi okay, yeah, no great actor, but he does OK. At least he doesnt start to sing. Catch it on cable if you can. Its on Encore Action this month.#1

7961_4#Five years after the original Creepshow, another inferior horror sequel is penned by George A. Romero and Stephen King Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is really original or distinguished either. The first story is a horror staple, formulaic story about a wooden Indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but its just too familiar to be compelling enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners. The second story,  The Raft , is a Stephen King story. Its about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason. However, instead of being suspenseful, the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior, preventing us from really caring about what happens next. There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is  The Hitch-hiker , which is actually a retread re-adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film. Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens.  The Hitch-hiker  works the best out of these three offerings, but its not without its problems either. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up running over a hitch-hiker, or so she thinks. However, we dont know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. As in many average stories of this type, the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns. The wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears as the  creep  in this installment. The good thing is there havent been any more sequels.  1/2 of 4 stars.#0
7736_2#Journey to the Center of the Earth is the story of some tourists of Hawaii, three of them siblings, and one of them a young British nanny babysitting a dog. When the siblings accidentally drive off in their jeep with the basket of dog biscuits, the nanny follows them (it mightve just been safer to purchase more) all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore (I guess). For some reason, they actually go in the cave and then, when the place starts caving in, they try to get out to no avail, except for the six-year-old sister who they tell to go get help. Meanwhile, the more they move around in the cave, the more they continue to plummet further and further towards the earths cavernous core. And behold, it is here where they find the City of Atlantis and its bizarre alien habitants who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that doesnt want them asking to many questions about the worlds external to their own. I do like how in the end, no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help. Shed just be wandering around the Hawaiian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano, mind you.#0
74_3#They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. Its only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged.  Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! Ill give it 3/10, and thats only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.#0
3678_8#its a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points - the level of the stories has a large spectrum. some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring. - a lot of stories are not self-contained (if you compare to f.e. coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline or however you wanna call it) but well, most stories are really good, some are great and overall its one of the best movies this year for sure! well, i think thats it!#1
5790_1#This movie is ridiculous. Anyone saying the acting is great and the casting is superb have never seen even mediocre cinema. The acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I feel like all the other  soaring  comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers. I was not very impressed by the storyline, but just wanted to see some beautiful Oregon countryside, and there was some decent cinematography--but the casting was anything BUT inspired. I think this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the Amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that reviving it is worthwhile, and possible. It places jokes in the wrong and all-too-obvious places, and makes me think it was written by the State Department or something. Back to the drawing board. To even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics like Harold and Maude is absolutely retarded, and along the same line of begging and pretension and  joking  as is rampant in this film.#0
927_10# Father of the Pride   was another of those good shows that unfortunately dont have a very long life . And that is pretty sad ,specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air ( think in  The Simple life  ) I admit that are many similarities with this show and  The Simpsons  ,but despite the similarities ,the show have it own merits . The animation is just adequate ,not incredible ,but is good .The best are the characters . All the animals are very likable and funny , and even Sigfried and Roy had their moments . The music was good ,I liked many of the songs . Even if the show isnt very original ,I think that this had lots of potential .Like  Mission Hill   a show that isnt very famous but I liked a lot , this didnt have the appreciation that it deserved . What a shame .#1
6740_2#Too Much of Something Borrowed Grade B- By the use of many clever puns (often sexual), the film is actually funny. Although primarily a chick-flick the film has components everyone can enjoy. The feel good story, and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time.#0
4585_10#This movie is Jackies best. I still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever. I also like the bad guys in this movie (the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike some of Jackies other work, this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of Jackies fans.#1
11579_2#I have to admit, I dont remember much about the characters or the story, though Im not sure there was one, I was soooo irritated by this movie that I had a bit of a hard time focusing on it. How can you name a movie  Keys to Tulsa  and then film it in Texas? The flat desert country around Arlington ( I think that was the location) in no way resembles the green rolling hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in. Obviously no one in the movie has EVER BEEN to Tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it. Hadnt anyone at least seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know this sounds picky but I cant help it. I watched this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not liven up this meandering,and mean story of self-involved people who are NOT IN TULSA  Im sorry, it cant be more expensive to film in Oklahoma. What if  To Live and Die in LA  had been shot in Toronto? Would that suck? Well so does this.#0
11738_2# Iowa  wants to be  Requiem for a Dream  for Midwest meth, but it comes across as a hard R rated  Reefer Madness .  I caught this at its commercial run in NYC because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival where it got considerable-- and inexplicable-- buzz.#0
6815_4#The eight Jean Rollin film I have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! A would-be female vampire (scantily-clad, as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to feast on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) As if unsure where all of this would lead him, the writer-director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank-faced heros kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant(?!) from the future! The languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical of both the film-maker (ditto the seashore setting at the {anti}climax) and the  Euro-Cult  style, as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display. Personally, the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six latter-day Luis Bunuel films) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time #0
8481_4#The acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongggg.not only did they get the figure skating rules wrong, but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check. You also dont BLOCK for someone. Not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big. I play hockey and Im only 411 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also we skate A LOT faster then the ones in the movie. I was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck.although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates..also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice you couldnt do in a regular hockey game. She basically tripped the person, which is illigal. Its also unrealistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates. That really made me angry that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team.#0
4276_4#This overrated, short-lived series (a measly two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. I am not quite sure what they mean by  ground-breaking  and  original  when they fawn all over Lynch and his silly little TV opus. What exactly is their criteria of what is original? Sure, compared to the  Bill Cosby Show  or  Hill Street Blues  its original. Definitely. Next to  Law & Order  TP spews originality left and right. Go to http rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and check out my  TV & Cinema 150 Worst Cases Of Nepotism  list.#0
80_3#I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets  visions  when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffers performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.#0
12126_2#Here again is yet another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role she knows how to play? This time its set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man. I am so not surprised because that is so very predictable. Then her husband gets mad and throws the milk. I wouldnt be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well. I wouldnt be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie. Then after some milk throwing, she says sorry and sees the blouse man again. Duh. Then while she is making it with him, her son gets stung by wasps. My mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest. This kids mom didnt have time to tell him that, she was too busy with the blouse man.#0
11810_3#I noticed with some amusement that in the end credits, the Detroit PD is thanked for their participation. The Chief of Police even has one speaking line playing himself (and boy, can you tell he cant act). The reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later. Not the kind of PR, I would think a police force would want. Other than that, this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the 70s with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that cant get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife. He makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse. Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat. The movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense (why do people that are only guilty of a robbery, take on a whole police force?). Not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys, we get to see four. Then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the braindead  Friday Foster  and  Bucktown , I shouldnt have wondered.#0
8204_8#Sudden Impact was overall better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was building up to be a great movie, but then I saw the villain(s) and was disappointed. 8/10.#1
7399_4#Going down as the most expensive film in Finnish history, to date,  Dark Floors  is a horror film with an extremely Lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of  Floors  (ironically enough) in an abandoned hospital, in which our protagonists are trapped. Lead by an autistic daughter and her father, himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter, make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses. Accompanied by a security guard, a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned, but they are not alone. Directed by Finnish- born Pete Riski, more known for his television work,  Dark Floors  is filmed in English, using mainly English actors but has the notable inclusion of Finlands arguably most famous group  Lordi  (2006 Eurovision song contest winners) as themselves, i.e. in their on stage monstrous costumes, as the films antagonists, yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most, in convincing the audience. Its infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well, you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as  Hollywood  churns out, much in the similar way that George A Romero started out, but it doesnt always materialise. I enjoyed the film and didnt feel as if I had wasted the ninety minutes I had just sat through, but I felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously, emotionally or critically. I felt the almost Lynchian narrative was a standout plus point, but it fades out into nothingness. Why did it happen? What does it mean? Will they go through this all again? Without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty. Was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence? Had the autistic girl watched the Eurovision Song Contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under? Who knows? And unfortunately I fail to work up the energy to even care.  Dark Floors  is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from Mr Lordi, who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas. Its one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation.#0
7252_8#I saw this film prior to joining the British Army. I went through my basic training, at first difficult and then as I progressed much easier. My time was spent during the height of the troubles in NI and the cold war. There was times when I questioned myself on what I had gotten myself into, not for long, as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively. The voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on, though I would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations. Some years later I was in Canada for a family get together. An Aunty of mine who lives in the USA and is a lecturer at the Columbus Uni Ohio had done a paper on the effects of the British Army in NI. She spent some time out there researching. Although an ex pat she was very anti-British. She made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier. My only answer was see the film A long days dying. Its the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right at the end.#1
1333_1#I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. I deleted the movie from my DVR at 70 mins. into the movie. Much better movies out there than this#0
5052_10#This is an excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar , the winter, canoeing , trapping , hunting and the like. It is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me . Brosnan does well portraying a complex man , a very fine performance. Annie Galipeau is lovely in her first large role. The rest of the cast is solid.#1
7023_9#I loved that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer, allowing the layers to peel from the characters through their interactions with each other about the unspoken loss that has so affected each of them.  Kudos for this achievement.#1
10311_3#SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas does his usual tough guy/pretty boy act, and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass kicking hot chick Alexa. OJ Simpson is a detective, coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona. Translation cable TV filler. There isnt enough skin to qualify this as a Guilty Pleasure. The script has some gaping holes. Best/Worst Moment In one jarring scene, OJs partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot, or words to that effect. This vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough; but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released, it is truly appalling, and therefore entertaining in an unintentional, horrible way. I was so startled that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose. Now THATS a Guilty Pleasure. BC#0
7359_10#where would one start a review of the film Snitchd? James Cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since Encino Man. his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop McClure, which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor! said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking, and discovers a gang war to rival that of Police Academy 1, and i mean the one where Jones is racially vilified by his new partner, but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will EVER HEAR.

6168_10#Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main characters bank. She has a lovely scene with Roshan Seth in a restaurant. Theres more information on her website at >Having stated my personal interest in the film, I have to say that I think it is a beautiful movie - moving, funny and beautifully filmed.#1
5582_9#In 1930,Europe received quite a shock when Luis Bunuels LAge Dor was released, causing a riot in Paris when screened there,resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years. Three years later,in 1933,when Europe had gotten over the shock,it was once again turned on its ear with Ekstase,a symphony (of sorts)to love. The film starred a young,unknown German actress named Hedwig Kiesler,who would later change her name to Hedy Lamarr,when she moved to America to escape the madness of Adolf Hitler,as Eva,a young bride who has just married a cold,distant loveless husband (played by Emil Jerman),only to discover that she has made a major mistake. One divorce later,Eva is footloose & fancy free & is out one day, skinny dipping in a lake,when she discovers Adam,a handsome,young engineer (played by Aribert Mog)who takes a real fancy to her (and she,him). After a wild night of passion,Evas ex-husband turns up once again,hoping to win Eva back,only to find he now has a rival. I wont spoil what transpires. Czech director, Gustav Machaty (who directed the original screen version of Madam X,another parable in romantic obsession) directs from a screenplay by Jacques Koerpel,Frantisek Horky & Machaty,from the novel by Robert Horky. The films velvety cinematography (which reminded me of Avant Garde photographer,Man Rays photos of the era,which goes for some impressionistic use of light & shadow,a lot)is by Hans Androschin & Jan Stallich). The films brisk editing is by Antonin Zelenka & the films art direction, which goes for a lush,nearly Art Deco look,is by Bohumil Hes). If I have any quirk about this film, it is the music score,by Giuseppe Becce,which goes for an over the top,melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast (certain themes are repeated over & over again,wearing out its welcome,fast---kind of like some of David Leans over use of certain musical themes,especially in Lawrence Of Arabia,and Dr.Zhivago). Some years back,a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material,cobbled together from various European existing prints available,restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the Vatican condemned it as  decadent  (yeah,rightlike the Church never did anything wrong),and the Hayes office cut it to ribbons,when it was finally released in the U.S.A. in 1936,in a  Hayes Office  approved cut (likewise). Minimal dialog in German with English subtitles (it was meant to be a mainly visual experience). Not rated,but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by Hedy Lamarr (done tastefully,mind you) & some suggestions of sexual content (likewise)that would scarcely earn it a PG-13 rating,nowadays. Worth a look if you have any interest in early European cinema,or Avant Garde/Experimental cinema#1
4360_10#In this grim melodrama, Barbara Stanwyck plays the eldest of three wealthy sisters who become orphans when their father dies in France. Threatened with the danger of losing the opulent family home, Big Sister makes a grand sacrifice and secretly marries a real estate developer so she can inherit her aunts fortune. A few years later, she learns that he is after the family estate and wants to tear it down so she leaves him and tries to stop him. More time passes and the husband ends up taking her to court when he learns that she has borne him a son without telling him. The part of  Gig Young  was played by actor Byron Barr who later assumed the name before he became famous. Anyone interested in purchasing a copy let me know by writing to me at iamaseal2@yahoo.com#1
8447_3#I dont know what I missed here, but I cant believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film. I thought it was silly, and a bit over the top. I did like the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, however the others were just boring. So in the end I give  Slither  a 3, for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes.#0
1618_3#I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I had seen Jacquets previous movie (march of the penguins) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio. However, I was severely disappointed. Most of all, this movie is terribly boring. Literally NOTHING happens. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like  well then the winter comes, and then spring, and then theres an eagle, and a river, and one time it is dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and another time the fox has babies  and so on. After about half an hour I began sighing, yawning, rolling my eyes, cursing the reviewer at the radio station, and hoping that it would be over soon. But the movie went on and on. When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the movie are (a) The girl, who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie (one year), and shows exactly two facial expressions Joy and Seriousness. She is cute, no question about that. However, a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence. I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear, drown in the river, or something similarly terrible. (b) The commentary by the girls adult voice, which tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, redundant things. (c) The music, which is desperately lacking subtlety. When the girl is happily jumping around, the music jumps around, too. When the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music becomes threatening, too. It reminded me of the very early days of film-making, and was just too predictable to enjoy. Admittedly, many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it, at least they got somehow involved. Thus, my warning concerns adults only If you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.#0
5109_10#I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result I dont remember anything about the movie. But I do remember the sensation it caused from Gilleys and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lees hit song  Lookin for Love  which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it. However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is, I was blown away. Few movies have hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bobs ranch house, the chemical plant in Texas City, Gilleys dance hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe for that reason it doesnt have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (I for one cant stand it despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. For that reason I love it #1
1176_10#Firstly let me say that I didnt like the fact that The Rock won the title that is so gay. Next I feel Regal should have got back his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champ. Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long already Brock should have won it. I am pleased with Storm and Christian being tag champs, best match was the Booker T and Big Show match in my opinion.#1
4555_1#This film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers. The main point of the book, the insights, are hardly even touched upon, leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives. Please dont waste your time, READ THE BOOK #0
9741_8#I was pleasantly surprised to find that How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was nowhere near as gross-out a comedy as the trailer had led me to expect. I rapidly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained engrossed throughout. Pacing of the more visual humorous content was, I thought, spot on. (I mean I got the impression I was witnessing Peggs attempts at restoring lost control very much in real time, so to speak.) At other moments there was time allowed to share the main protagonists (i.e. Peggs and Dunsts) reflection on how events were affecting them and what had led them to where they now found themselves. All the characters were well cast, to some extent interesting in and of themselves, and generally quite likable. (Any apparent ruthless ambition displayed tended to be tempered by a corresponding good natured resilience.) An entertaining, intelligently scripted, brilliantly directed and superbly acted film that I would thoroughly recommend.#1
10670_10#This is a great film  The first time I saw it I thought it was absorbing from start to finish and I still do now. I may not have seen the play, but even if I had it wouldnt stop me thinking that the film is just as good.#1
7010_4#I know no one cares, but I do. This film is historic for one reason. It is the unity of two heroes from two great seventies sci-fi films. Well, one is great, and one is quite bad. The great one is truly great, in fact its the best. The bad one is truly bad, in fact its the worst. Of course of the great I refer to  Star Wars  and its star Mark Hamill, aka  Luke Skywalker , who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his Vette swiped and then goes to Vegas (on a lead) and after a whole lot of adventures, eventually recovers it. (Since hes into fixing cars I guess you can call him  Lube Skywalker ). Along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold, and ends up facing off with a character played by Kim Milford, the hero from the seventies sci-fi cult film  Laserblast , which is, as Ive hinted at earlier, the worst sci-fi film ever made. Milford plays the lead baddie whom Hamill must steal his car back from. I realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci-fi heroes, but I do. And I also must say that this is one of the best/worst movies of all time. Mark Hamills acting needs the force, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the character of the hooker played by Annie Potts just might be the most annoying character of all time, ever, in any film Ive ever seen. But its a fun movie to watch on a weekend day, or a weekday night, late at night, very late. Its one of those films that meanders, looking for something but without quite finding it and yet, at the same time, its entire purpose is, like free-form jazz, to simply exist as is. And it does. And what is, isnt that great, but you cant say it isnt entertaining, because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off, but you wont feel cheated. So turn off your mind, relax, and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations, and may the force be with you, always.#0
1704_1#You wouldnt expect a movie like this to be good, and it isnt. Its a no budget, ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held cameraand its hilarious. The actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families. The gore effects are actually some of the most sickening Ive ever seen. It seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts, and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. Its a funny and sickening film, and its about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. My rating BOMB/    . 90 mins.#0
7178_1#Overrated and only for those people in their 20s whom wear particularly thick rose tinted glasses, who never actually saw it in the first place because they were to young. Awful animation, dialogue and a tired narrative. A real product of the 80s, the novel gimmick of a puzzle TOY (thats right, TOY not the absurd, pretentious and child alienating  collectors action figurine ), sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other paraphernalia, only matters to those who bought the TOY when they were  actual  children in the period of 84 to 87. It Has become cult because of those same adults are to immature to let go of their memories. Avoid.#0
6341_7#Although I really enjoyed Jim Carreys latest  serious  performances ( The Truman Show ,  Man on the Moon ), Ive always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic, talented actor those bozos at the Academy Awards seem to dislike him so much, he has never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. Well, any  institution  that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as  Titanic  shouldnt be taken seriously. That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being that is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoon-like, so unreal, that never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the Christmas. I loved this film to bits, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now. As timeless as they come.#1
1574_9#Although the beginning of the movie in New York takes too long, the movie is a must see for people who like this genre. When Hannah goes to Berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war, the movie gets much much better.The movie is a bit like The Pianist, can not really be compared.#1
9315_7#Prominent attorney Walter Pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. Panged by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the  unknown man  who heads the syndicate, and murders him. The ironies engage when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another  unknown man  -- himself. Though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years.#1
9409_4#I liked this show! I think it was nothing with wrong with it! Only that Spidey dont punch anyone but only for that the show doesnt suck! Some people only think this show is bad because of that. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! To bad Sandman never appear but i kinda like it! Best Spidey show ever  My favorite episodes are 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda But i guess everything than this was bad!#0
61_3#Theres not a drop of sunshine in  The Sunshine Boys , which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simons sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (its said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question  how long did vaudeville last, anyway? ). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasnt coupled with one of Neil Simons screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanics garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give  The Sunshine Boys  some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if wed all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on.  1/2 from     #0
3813_7#Initially, I would have thought that Secret Sunshine had something critical to say of religion (and here being Christianity), and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith, or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou. Surprisingly, it was none of the sort and was largely non-judgemental, putting in place events as a matter of fact, and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion. If you bite into the hype this movie is generating, then perhaps youll realize only Jeong Do- yeons excellent portrayal is worth mentioning, as she totally owns her role as the widow Shin-ae who is probably the most unluckiest person on Earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time, and if you look at it carefully, most of which are of her own doing. Watching her transformation, is worth the ticket price, and despite having my personal favourite Korean actor Song Kang-ho in the movie, this is something he just breezed right through.#1
10565_9#In 1933 Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals that offered Depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes. Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway Theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on. In addition to Keeler and Powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players. Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. The script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cuts everyone down to size. Busby Berkeleys dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34. Sadly, the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of Footlight again. Gentility and morality made sure of it.#1
9565_8#Dog Bite Dog isnt going to be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slapping, stabbing and shooting (but dont worry  the leads a terrible shot), it can best be described as a violent romp through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister. Despite being filthy from his journey, hes almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. If this sounds wildly implausible to you, you should probably avoid this film. It acted as my cue to suspend disbelief, and I had a lot more fun for it. Im inclined to give it a (high) pass, however, if only because of the ending  Ive rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment. This is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous#1
7154_3#This film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew. Based on Shielah Grahams autobiography, it seems like the powers that be couldnt leave well enough alone. They couldnt decide if this was to be Grahams story or Fitzgeralds story, and also how much they should soft-pedal whoevers story it turned out to be. So a film that could have been a story about two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Ms. Graham)personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either. Added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959. Clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing. However - and this saved the film for me - Kerr has never looked lovelier, and Peck is as always a very handsome man. They truly make a beautiful, mature couple, and I only wish they had better material to work with. There is one scene that does work - Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunken state, and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs. Other than that, the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other Wald produced soaps of the 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING).#0

3902_10#Id heard of Eddie Izzard, but had never seen him in action. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw he was on HBO one night last summer, I put it on, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. Hes better than Robin Williams ever was. He has total control of the audience; when he does the Englebert is dead - no hes not, routine, the audience doesnt know what to think by the end. God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Python Spanish Inquisition as carried out by the Church of England - Cake or Death? is priceless. My jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show. We scoured the TV listings for months after that to be able to see him again, and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on. If you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and tape it, you wont be disappointed.#1
7946_10#This movie is a true masterpiece, it really is. Its rare you come across such a heartwarming flick, full of fun, laughter, heartbreak, and with a little drama to keep you on your toes.  A favourite for all time - anyone who doesnt like this film must just not like animals. Rent it or buy it now, and itll leave you with happy memories thatll last a lifetime.#1
9994_10# Life stinks  is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. The black and the white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks performance is brilliant as always, and the other actors work is fine too. This movie has some Capra flavor, that s why is so good. Yes indeed, Life Stinks.#1
4312_10#If you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s (in L.A.) then youve missed a special treat. This is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for Americans in the 90s and it even carries over into todays world in which we live in. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (more than one way),love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc..and the list goes on. This story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life. It helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life. Makes us ask questions of ourselves. Have we done enough for others, are we like this, etc.??? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that Im sure others will enjoy for a lifetime. Take note of Mary Mcdonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glovers wonderful performance through this whole film. These actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now. I still enjoy it again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and dont forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out its symbolism for the movie??hmmm I almost forgot this is probably Steve Martins very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done. He, too does an excellent job in this movie. This may come as a surprise to most of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy truly good film making..#1
5117_10#Very few movies have had the impact on American culture the way Urban Cowboy has. Thank god it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when youre flipping channels at 300AM you just cant take your eyes off.my top three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW but thats beside the point. I remember Urban Cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner, men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers, and if you didnt know how to two-step you were considered a social moron! Personally I think its a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Whod a thunk. Hes actually believable too. The soundtrack is awesome. Too bad Charlene Tilton, of TVs Dallas fame ruined Johnny Lees career cause that guy was just terrific. The show stealer here is Scott Glenn as the greaser ex-con redneck cowboy. And I aint got nothing against greaser ex-con cowboys semi-being one myself, but Ive always envied what I feel to be the greatest power line of all time. Pack-at S t!  Sort of like Clints  make my day.  And watching him slap Sissy around is the closest thing Ill see to my Julia Roberts fantasy so.. Like I said, beautiful. 9/10#1
7182_1#I couldnt not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel (trust me, double negatives are required here -- its that bad). This film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. The musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good ( Thank You Very Much  has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would gladly bear the chains worn by Scrooge in the films bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again. Steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs.#0
2526_9#Its awesome! In Story Mode, your going from punk to pro. You have to complete goals that involve skating, driving, and walking. You create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team(you can pick a team to be on) and you then start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II(not part of story mode though) from Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons, and another skater. You can create your own goals like SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap, and much more. You can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak. If you get bored of doing that, you can do the premade goals in premade parks. The only thing I didnt like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars. 9/10.#1
12266_4#Republic pictures comes late in the game to the  werewolf  er Werecat genre. The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts. He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller. The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents, something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a  catman . Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancé ends up dead. Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesnt know if hes the killer or not. Take a pass.#0
5323_3#I cant believe that in the 34 prior comments, nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip-off of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster. Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is left in the lurch. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff. Technicolor transfer to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus would be rolling over in her grave. Check out the paperboy. Recognize him? But, its historically interesting to see the roots of Rock n Roll. Also interesting is Ewells introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.#0

11875_4#Mmm, doesnt a big stack of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and fruit preserves on top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. EAT it, you  Keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea. You have just had the Ally McBeal experience. And next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy like the fruit cup. Itll sit with you much better.#0
2756_3#{rant start} I didnt want to believe them at first, but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill. After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie  Gwoemul  (aka  The Host ) of 2006-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre-- successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill, which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film  Shiri/Swiri , by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did? {rant end} In short, I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem  Arirang  being played at the very end. As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but Ive seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons).#0
5297_4#It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there. This is by far not one of the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst nonetheless. Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night Brings Charlie is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is way more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films. If youre into slasher films, definitely give this film a watch. It is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers, but not by much. The comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious. You may forget the movie, you may remember it. Ill remember it because I love the name.#0
1470_1#I was looking over our DVD tower last night for something to watch. We were between NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled one out that I never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it sounded like a rip-off of  The Big Chill  but, with the all-star cast, felt it might be worth watching. Boy was I wrong  Not only was it like  The Big Chill,  it was a rip-off almost character by character. The Bill Paxton character was a copy of William Hurt ( where have you been all this time  role) -spoiler warning- and, lo and behold, he remains behind to take care of the old place(cabin/camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found myself wondering why Im even watching these people. There was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them. How did  Unca Lou  even find these characters after 20 years? Plus it wasnt even funny, except when Perkins fell, err flopped out of bed the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife,  Were there any endearing characters in this film?  Are you sleeping over there?  She replied,  No, Im still thinkingNo, none I can think of.  #0
6151_7#I will always have a soft spot for this Disney flick, another of their part live action/part animation entries that sought to recreate the success of  Mary Poppins  and never quite made it. When I was in grade school, every once in a while we would have a movie day, where the whole school would crowd into the cafeteria, and a movie would be projected the old-fashioned way, multiple reels and all. At the time, it seemed like a momentous occasion whenever this day arrived, and  Bedknobs and Broomsticks  is one of the movies I can remember seeing this way. Grade A#1
6167_4#Like most people, i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty Bolo Yeung plastered all over the box, and the assumption (from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film) that this film is all about the Beast from the East kickin ass for 90 minutes. All in all then, a below-average kung-fu film lifted several huge notches due to you-know-who. Ive never met a person who didnt think Bolo Yeung was great. The mans a legend #0
11071_2#The various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used. If Ms. Pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer. Otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical Canadian movies. As other reviewers have pointed out Canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value, which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get. Perhaps Canadian movie producers are consciously trying to  de-commercialize  their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing.#0
2773_1#Up to this point, Gentle Rain was the movie I found the worst in history. It has been supplanted by this blockbuster out of Asia. It has one  star  and it is John Rhys Davies. He is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling, magical flying baddie he is cast here. The rest of these people couldnt act their way out of a junior high school play. No clichés were missed in the dialogue, and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible. The one funny scene was unintentional. The brother of the King appears on the scene. The king? A handsome, older, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) The brother? A six foot European. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for this. They just expected us not to notice that this poor mans Jet Lis brother was a wannabe Pierce Brosnan in a cheap dimestore  Injun  wig right out of an old western movie from the forties.#0
11441_10#As a person who sought out an existence as a professional person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic. My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.#1
7679_10#For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is  Wow . It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and although its not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic. It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next #1
552_8#Now, admittedly, Im no ardent student of the genre. As a matter of fact, Ive tended always to shy away from Westerns because, in spite of all their critical cachet as Americas primal stories (or whatever), they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either  shoot up the Injuns,   the big gunfight,  or  Hey, lets form a posse!  In other words, it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention, that it left precious little room for surprise or originality. (And yes, I HAVE seen at least some of the so-called  greats , and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment - including Stagecoach, Rio Bravo, My Darling Clementine, and of course the infamous [but profoundly dull] Clint Eastwood-Sergio Leone teamups in the 60s.) I certainly have more Westerns to see, but this is for now my favorite, and the yardstick by which I will necessarily judge all the others. It deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is.#1
1570_2#Comment this movie is impossible. Is terrible, very improbable, bad interpretation e direction. Not look #0
6586_10#Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes ever, narrowly edging out the great Basil Rathbone of course, and this is probably the best adaptation of a Conon-Doyle short story. Excellent performances all round, especially from Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a superb piece of drama.#1
10640_8#This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Dolph Lundgren, however Alex Karzis is awful as the villain!. The story is very good, and i found the kids to be likable for the most part, plus Dolph Lundgren is simply amazing in this!. The action scenes are excellent, and its almost like Die Hard except its set in a school!, plus Kata Dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick!. The finale is very exciting, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, however i just wished it had another villain, because Alex Karzis just didnt cut it as the villain way too OTT, and laughable for my tastes. This should be higher then 4.1 in my opinion, as i thought it was a great action film, and while the kids, were very stupid at times, they got quite resourceful as the movie went along!, plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well!. The ending is very amusing,and Corey Seviers character was my favorite student!, plus Dolph has still got it!. This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Lundgren!, but Alex Karzis is awful as the villain, still i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Sidney J. Furie does a very good job here with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. There is a bit of blood and violence. We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,knife in the side of the head, bloody arrow hits, an impaling, and other minor stuff. The Acting is fantastic!. Dolph Lundgren is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, kicks that ass as usual, had great chemistry with the kids, had an awesome character, is very charismatic, and he may not have shown a great emotional rage, he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch!, he is one of my favorite actors! (Lundgren Rules ). Alex Karzis is god awful as the villain, he is laughably OTT, was boring, and not menacing at all, he also annoyed the crap out of me. Kata Dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do, she was the real villain in my opinion!. Corey Sevier is funny as Mick, he was my favorite student, and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half, i liked him a lot!, he had good chemistry with Dolph too. Dov Tiefenbach(Willy),Chris Collins(Hogie),Mpho Koaho(Jay Tee),Danielle Hampton(Alicia),Nicole Dicker(Charlee) all do great as the students. Jennifer Baxter is very cute and is good as The fiancée. rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!.    1/2 out of 5#1
9534_10#Acting This film is a very well acted film. I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times; but for the most part, the acting is very good. The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you were to pause it, you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. He sets up every shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera is still, there is a postcard like quality to the screen. When the camera is moving, every shot is planned to understated perfection. But it doesnt stop there. Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work Ive seen. His work on this movie made it what it is. This movie is at the top of the list for best Cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but, I believe they missed the point of the movie. It is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other. The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. The music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores Ive herd. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world. I will be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies Ive ever seen.#1
12171_3#Being a slasher film aficionado, I typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I will say. While channel surfing the other night, Sleepaway Camp II happened to cross paths with me. Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but have never actually seen any of them (for shame, I know). I will note that since I have not seen the original, my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchises own design. Ultimately, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really did want to sleep away the camp. The deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them. If youre looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel surfing takes you across this one, check and see what else is on.#0

9402_1#Why was this film made? Even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that Australian film investors were given, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go-ahead. For goodness sakes, the actors cast in this film are Aussie b-grade celebs (not actors, people like John Michael Hollywood Howson, the original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday, and the voice-over guy in Countdown. But in saying that, this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves  none. The script is bad (even for a self-confessed b-grade horror) and the acting and film quality is worse. It often looks as though it is a home movie, but even a home movie has realism. Anyone interested in Australian cinema, please, for the love of God, pretend this film was NEVER made.#0
838_9#   1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. A well formulated story and film all together, Brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his  Bond  movies. After 2004s  After the sunset  his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time. Professional hit-man, so to speak, Julian Noble on a job in Mexico City winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly one of his best roles) also on business there. The two on-screen duo produce a comically charged, laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs. Davis in one of her best roles since  American Splendor  gives another charming and witty performance. One of the years most enjoyable and best films. My final rating 9/10#1
10223_4#I remembered the title so well. To me, it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And it had Vincent Masseys voice from behind whiskers. Well Flora Robson was great. Her next signature, for me, would be  55 Days at Peking . The same role but with different sumptuous gowns. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I like black-and-white films. Was everything done in Elizbethan times at night? It was talky and difficult to fathom, at times. I couldnt tell which was the love interest. Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the Armada. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This might have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts. And I missed daylight #0
5802_3#Nikolai Gogols story  Viy  has been filmed again and released to home video in the US via Faith Films. Given the choice Id give it a pass, even at a bargain bin price. My advice would be to find the 1960s version of the tale called Viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god.#0
6607_4#Not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. Other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldnt have known if i hadnt read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, RGVs Aag is worth watching for Amitabhs solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.#0
7989_10#When I remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it. It was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview, its stunning, and then when it comes out, you hear nothing and totally miss it, and your memory totally doesnt correct the mistake of missing it. Man On Fire was one of those movies. I was curious on a rental one time, and I decided to take it home with me, my precious Blockbuster rental in my hands. I watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie. It is like none otherdrama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular. The cinematography done by Tony Scott is extremely well done and unique, unlike another movie. The subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices, and the music is very intriguing for the setting. I got into this movie, and ended up buying it as soon as I could scurry out of the household and head over to Best Buy. Ive watched it several times now. Denzel Washington (Creasy) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live. Dakota Fanning (Pita) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start. They bond and become good friends, until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood, La Hermandad. Creasy (Denzel) tells the mother of Dakota Fanning that he will hunt down the killers, fearing that Pita is dead. This is where Creasy really shows the person he can become. He uses his contacts from Pitas kidnapping and Creasys hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit. My favorite line of all, is in this movie, when Christopher Walken tells the AFI agent that  A man is a work of art, in anything that he does.cooking, whatever. Creasys art is deathhes about to paint his masterpiece.  He plays a very unique roll of Creasys old partner and friend. After finally pursuing the brother of  The Voice,  leader of La Hermandad. Creasy arranges a meeting to trade Pita for himself and The Voices brother. In the end, Creasy dies from being shot earlier, and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss. It is a very sincere and sad ending, but a great one. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick. The story is in depth, everything is explained from beginning to end, and nothing corny at all in any way or manner.#1
6261_8#Fantastic documentary of 1924. This early 20th century geography of todays Iraq was powerful. Watch this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille didnt take notes before making his The Ten Commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, later created Cinerama, an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film. Fans of Werner Herzog will find this film to be a treasure, with heartbreaking tales of struggle, complimented by the land around them, never has the human capacity to endure been so evident. The fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects, but of the filmmakers themselves.#1
12435_3#Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the Home Alone empire. Four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car. Because of baggage confusion, grouchy Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) gets the car. She gives it to her neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies turn up. The spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car. Home alone with the chicken pox, Alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress, but the spies always manage to elude the police while Alex is accused of making prank calls. The spies finally turn their attentions toward Alex, unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby-trap his entire house. Home Alone 3 wasnt horrible, but probably shouldnt have been made, you cant just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some funny parts, but I dont like when characters are changed in a movie series, view at own risk.#0
2149_10#Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyamas transformation is incredibly believable. The score is so moving, it brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic. Mais graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps. Tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character. You can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing  The King and I . Aokis character is both hilarious and pitiful. Masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right. This film is truly a keeper.#1
3184_8#This Hong Kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than weeks worth of The Young & The Restless. This one is more of a throwback to the original Emmanuelle trilogy(especially Goodbye Emmanuelle) than a DAmato sleazefest. Chai Lee(Emy Wong)undergoes a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot-to-trot streetwalker. Future Italian porn star/politician, Illona Staller, who would later go by the name Ciccolina(and have sex with an HIV positive John Holmes) plays Emys competition. Exotic locales and some decent soft-core scenes round this one out. Recommended for fans of the original Emmanuelle, of which I am one!#1
3264_1#This snarky, homophobic thing was dated in 1976. It seems particularly mean-spirited now, filled with gay stereotypes, and characters that are meant to be laughed at, rather than with. Redd Foxx does his standard schtick, Michael Warren at least tries to bring humanity to a one dimensional character, and Pearl--Pearl what were you thinking--? Pearl Bailey deserves far better.#0
5509_10#Im going to review the 2 films as a whole because I feel that is how it should be considered, and watched. When I talk about the film I am talking about parts 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other, as they should be. This is a must see film, and Jon Andersons  Che Guevara A Revolutionary Life  is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40s, 50s & 60s that placed unfair pressure on our South American neighbors, and the effects it fostered.#1
11661_1#Basically this is an overlong, unfunny, action/comedy. First of all Id like to say that I did enjoy the Wayans brother Scary Movie (1) and the sequel had its moments. Unfortunately white chicks doesnt even deliver HALF the laughs.  1/10 Completely unfunny, Thin storyline, A film that seems to be based on one idea (i.e. what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film?) but simply didnt have enough material.#0
11576_7#It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. Its actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with its flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if its made in the 90s, it doesnt have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but Im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just cant hate it. I think its an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.#1
5445_1#Ooof! This one was a stinker. It does not fall somewhere in between Star Wars and Thriller, thats for sure. In all actuality, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! video and Captain EO, only with not as big of a budget, and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying. Simon Le Bon preens front and center, while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from Roxy Musics last 3 albums. Brief clips from Barbarella add nothing. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the part when they played Hungry Like The Wolf but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman painted with tiger stripes? I mean, they arent singing Eye of the Tiger or Hungry like the Tiger its a Wolf! Whatever.) A DVD of Duran Durans 80s videos is probably worth a look for nostalgias sake#0
199_10#Ive seen hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classics (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings) but among them, my favorite is this film (it may not be the best--but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked it up on IMDb, I noticed I immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made. Marion Davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not JUST William Randolph Hearsts mistress. The story involves a hick from Georgia coming to Hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star! Her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must-see!#1
9588_10#When Paris is Burning came out, I totally dismissed it. I was not into the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be campy and silly. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and I ran out and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. I felt as though I knew all of the characters personally. The 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture. What a terrific job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know.  I hope they make another documentary. I LOVED IT#1
7163_10#seriously i loved this film..i had started to read the book and i loved itthe way everything was set up and everything had a purposei think this film did so well was because Louis Sachar wrote the screenplay..and of course Andrew Davis directed itShia Lebouf gives a great performance for his first filmthe storyline is very cool and interestingtheres humor, heart and intensityit is very similar to the book..i find this film to be not the least bit boringi absolutely loved itand i encourage anyone to read the book..all in all this film is very well put together and carefully craftedtwo thumbs up for me in every single way#1
4853_10#I have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind, movies by Will Hay and Abbot & Costello especially as those are my favourites. I picked this movie up on DVD as it was using the same idea as Will Hays  Oh Mr Porter  which is one of the finest comedies ever made. I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie finished at 1245am). I find that movies of this kind, to do with Ghost Trains, etc, are best viewed at night time with the lights out. That way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this movie. We need more of this type of movie in todays market. But sadly it could be over looked in favour of movies with nudity and swearing and crude humour. This sort of movie making era (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter, etc) to me is the golden age of cinema!.#1
1882_1#What an appalling piece of rubbish  Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is? Yes, its  arty ; and yes, its  foreign , but . thats not enough. The plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show but not so slickly made. And oh yes if I had neighbours like these, Id move #0
5681_8#I had no problem with the film, which I thought was pretty good. Its the actual LAPD crime scene video that disturbed me. I wonder if Lions Gate REALLY thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place. Sorry Lions Gate, this was an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA  Getting back to the film The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was a sleaze ,mistreats the women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend),and he is hopelessly deep into drugs. His connection to Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian)creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous Wonderland murders. Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders? We may never know the entire truth to the story(Nash is still alive and a free man),but the film does a pretty good job nonetheless.#1
7615_1#me, my boyfriend, and our friend watched this  movie  if thats what u wanna call it, and we agree with the last person, but we were stupid and bought the damn thing, we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it. theses  actors  are never gonna become nothing because this movie.#0
11895_1#Oh my God what the hell happened here?  Im not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this? The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in  King Kong vs Godzilla ,Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy.Its about some villain called Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong.When he does(thats when Linda Miller gets annoying)he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes.Then Dr.Who sends the robot after him. Dont watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do beware of the disappointment you will receive.#0
5119_3#This movie isnt about football at all. Its about Jesus/GOD  Its the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus, or pump iron for Jesus. Yeah, Jesus was totally buffed, liked contact sports, and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells. DUHHH! This movie should have been entitled  Hiking for Jesus,  or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity, and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb. That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help. The recent sports movie  Invincible  was 100 times more inspiring than this was, and Jesus wasnt even a factor. It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream. Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world. The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey. I only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act.#0
780_2#This show is awful. How is George wanting the death of his mother funny? This show is terrible. The parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services. The daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat. George isnt funny, especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least Ive chuckled at him a few times, but mainly at how pathetic he is. Georges mother, Benny, in an awful, despicable character. Sure, her husband left her, but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated George as a baby is beyond me. I give it 2 starts, because the wife is extremely attractive.#0
1418_4#I dont know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business! This movie (short) is gross (to say the least)! It is a bunch of 5-7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins, acting like adults (and too much so!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example of how  the good old days  may not have been so good after all! (Thank GOD we have laws against this kind of material now!) {This is one short from the  Shirley Temple Festival }#0
1746_1#Probably the worst Bollywood film Ive seen. 2/10#0
9911_10#Rosalind Russell executes a power-house performance as Rosie Lord, a very wealthy woman with greedy heirs. With an Auntie Mame-type character, this actress can never go wrong. Her very-real terror at being in an insane assylum is a wonderful piece of acting. Everyone should watch this.#1
9685_10#A very refreshing story, the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average humans. Shows humans from a birds point of view. Especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with. Not all birds are bird-brained#1
6336_7#OK, so the FX are not high budget. But this story is based on actual events. Not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors, even richer  As most movies that are based on books, there are somethings that just dont fit. Only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events, not a knock-off as most people believe it is  This movie is in no way related too TWISTER! Other than both movies are about tornadoes. For those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a couple of things you need to remember The actual  night of the twisters  was June 3, 1980. So this movie was released 16 years after the actual events. Try think how far storm research has advanced in that time. It happened in a larger town; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Even though the movie calls the town something else, and says its a small town. For the real story check out http www.gitwisters.com #1
9184_1#F ck Me! Ive seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p ss! Im ashamed to say, I have this on my rack. Its hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile. I couldnt even give this horse-sh t excuse for a film away. Thats how bad it is.#0
392_9#The Legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who didnt like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film. They were expecting something akin to Star Wars, and it was not that. Joseph Campbell, I believe, would have liked this film. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords within us. We all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia someday. Granted some of the narration was a bit confusing, and some of the action got a little hokey at times, but I think other points of the film easily made up for it. Id watch it again.  I dont know if theres a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (The dubbed USA version.) It might have been dumbed down for American audiences, which really would have detracted from this film.#1
7838_8#If youre a T-Rex/Marc Bolan fan, I recommend you check this out. It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that arent part of the concert, but fun to watch, leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people, and when the concert is shown a talented musician, both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls. Watching him in concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of the live performances. True, there are a few songs missing that I would like to have seen on there, but like any album it cant have everything. I just bought this in 2006, but if I would have know it came out in 1972, I would have definitely bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash!#1
10837_10#As an aging rocker, this movie mentions Heep and Quo - my 2 favourite bands ever - but with the incredible cast (everyone) - and the fantastic storyline - I just love this piece of creative genius. I cannot recommend it more highly - and Mick Jones added so much (Foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I have watched this great work more than 10 times- Bill Nighy - what a voice - and Jimmy Nail - talent oozes from every pore - then Astrid. and Karen.. what more could an aging rocker ask for  10/10 - bloody brilliant. Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, Originally from Windsor, England.#1
7607_8#Its not well shot, well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show Ive seen since Twin Peaks. Every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. They have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like theyve just told you everything you wanted to know. However some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal. Some characters are very two dimensional. The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out over actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to. Annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing. However, the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously. All in all its a great show but not perfect.#1
12113_8#I usually steer clear of TV movies because of the many ways you know that its TV movies five seconds into the picture. This one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy, well-crafted mood that is established from the very start. While the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (even if claiming to be set in California the movie was largely shot around a stormy Vancouver, B.C.), the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement Olmos excellent acting.#1
1706_3#Wow, this was a very bad movie as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, they possibly had some kind of script but its difficult to tell based on the actual end result. Unless you are (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find, do not watch this. Period.#0
3580_4#The memory banks of most of the reviewers here mustve short-circuited when trying to recall this Cubic Zirconia of a gem, because practically everyone managed to misquote Lloyd Bochners Walter Thornton, when in a fit of peevish anger, he hurls the phallic garden nozzle at his new wife, Jerilee Randall-Thornton, (a nearly comatose Pia Zadora) which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the moviebut Im getting ahead of myself. In any case, poor Lloyd couldve been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put-upon co-star. THE LONELY LADY is in that category, and represents itself very well, considering the circumstances. Here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen soufflé Pia Zadora, a marginal singer/actress so determined to be taken seriously, that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers, (which this movie most certainly did!); a somewhat high-profile novel written by the Trashmaster himself, Harold Robbins (of THE CARPETBAGGERS and DREAMS DIE FIRST fame); a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all, that they tried to play this dreck like it was Clifford Odets or Ibsen; plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck, (and was probably contractually obligated NOT to demand the use of the Alan Smithee moniker to protect what was left of his reputation.) Like Lamont Johnsons LIPSTICK, Meir Zarchis I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, Roger Vadims BARBARELLA, Paul Verhoevens SHOWGIRLS or the Grandmammy of Really Bad Film-making, Frank Perrys MOMMY DEAREST, THE LONELY LADY is still often-discussed, (usually with disgust, disbelief, horrified laughter, or a unique combination of all three), yet also defies dissection, description or even the pretzel logic of Hollyweird. Nobodys sure how it came to be, how it was ever released in even a single theater, or why its still here and nearly impossible to get rid of, but take it or leave it, it IS here to stay. And I dont think that lovers of really good BAD movies would have it any other way.#0
9987_9#I was very moved by the story and because I am going through something similar with my own parents, I really connected. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate. And then theres the mistakes they made and have to live with. I loved Ellen Burstyns performance and who is Christine Horne? Shes fantastic! A real find. There is probably the most erotic scene Ive ever seen in a film, yet nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done. Overall the look and feel of the film was stunning, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very very good in this picture, he humanizes a man spiraling downwards. I liked the way the filmmaker approached this womans life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to hook us in, but not enough to bog down.#1
728_3#i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked  Buffet Froid  from this Director (bertrand blier) but the script of  Les Acteurs  is VERY POOR. why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario.#0
2802_1#I think that if I went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of English to come up with a script, it would make more sense than this. I could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the jokers in this film. This sounds really mean, but Im certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess (see what I did there?) neither the skills to act or to write anything, ever. Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL/10 Breasts - 9/10#0
2135_8#Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows how something, like dancing, can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit. This film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for days.#1
11148_4#This is the prime example of low budget, winning over what would be a good story line. Lets bring back Samaire Armstrong (having seen her work on the O.C. I know she can do better), then find a better script and budget. Bring in a better script and direction, and Id come back again.#0
6666_7#I cant say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers. Yes, its bogged down by an overly-padded running time, hamfisted editing, and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects. And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch.  (7/10)#1
11627_1#I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The jokes wouldnt have worked for gilligans island. If this had gone to series, would there have been jokes about Auschwitz, or would Eva have to replace her oven, only to have Adolf suggest the kind that seats 50?? Another post compared this show to I love Lucy. The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence.  After the damage the Nazis did to England and the number of people they killed, I would think the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced.#0

4136_1#I read the reviews before i watched this movie, and i didnt believe them. I love crap movies and i expected this one to be average. It wasnt. This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like greats. The film contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing storyline, bad makeup- and it bored me so much i turned it off. even the nudity was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this film? I dont think they did. You can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes. if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood. Avoid this trash - I watched it on TV and felt riped off, so dont spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.#0
11903_2#Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel.I dont know how he came up with this film! The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful,that makes it 2 out of ten.But this is not a movie.Is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west-east clash).There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC  with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).The characters are not well shaped.And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen.And the background music says  I will pray .The thing is not about religion actually.But it ends up with this.How you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray.The lights are already shining on the truth.Its just that nobody wants to see it. ps  My home is not a place.It is people The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence.But it is wasted behind this film making. (by the way; as  someone  mentioned below ,Americas finest young man are not finest,they are just the  poor  and the  hopeless  ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! )#0
6922_3#The one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested (as often they did) a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive-in screens. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook, who worked in films for years. This ones quite hard to find anymore; Id love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day, but dont remember particularly impressed way back when. Chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to U.S. theatres and video. But oh, that one sheetstill a gem of my later horror collection.#0
3133_9#Extremely well-conceived - part whatever happened to, part behind the scenes revisitation, part reunion film - all done in the same campy style that made the original series so much fun. I only wish this had been done 10 years ago to include more guest villains who have passed on.#1
3559_2#A young couple Mandy Pullman (Mitch Martin) and Roy Seeley (Matt Birman) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of Galen. They decide to start playing practical jokes on each other. Mandy hides in an old run down cabin, she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant. Roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed. Dr. Sam Cordell (John Cassavetes) and his daughter Jenny (Erin Flannery) are both new to Galen after the death of Sams wife. Sam is called into action by Police Chief Hank Walden (John Ireland) when Mandy and Roy are found. He performs the autopsy on Roy and treats Mandy for her horrific injuries. Soon after a curator at the local museum named Carolyn Davis (Denise Furgusson) is also attacked and raped. A local journalist named Laura Kincaid (Kerrie Keane) reports the events and suggests to Sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier. More rapes and murders occur. Meanwhile Jennys boyfriend Tim Galen (Duncan MacIntosh) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts. Tims story and digging into the towns past makes Sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an Incubus - a shape-shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce! Directed by John Hough this is one seriously dull horror film. The script by George Franklin based on the novel by Ray Russell is slow to say the least. Nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending Ive ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly. As the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes, but none are shown on screen. There is only one gore scene in the entire film too. The monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes. Everything about this film production-wise is very static and flat, the film has no energy or pace. The acting is dull and you dont feel or care for anyone. Check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions. The type of rubbish horror film making that youll forget within a day. A real waste of time, dont bother.#0
5035_7#McConaughey in a horror/thriller? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. And thus I recommend  Frailty . 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second, or even third viewing.#1
6853_1#Another trashy Grade Z quickie from the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson s 13 inch Clint Eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head(!) to Earth and gets involved in a gang war in South Bronx! Mercifully short, but deadeningly dull, with the cheesiest effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should have fired the continuity guy, too Note how Thomerson s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot. Laughably bad, but that s why we watch these movies, ain t it? Sequel  Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys  is reportedly even worse, if that s possible. #0
5980_3#Theres a group of Fox TV executives sitting around a boardroom table wondering what new show to commission.  Puuurfect, the big chief replies and then they all slap each other on the back and go and cancel Arrested Development.#0
7498_10#This is a bizzare look at Als  life , back when he still a hyper 20-something. The (real) home videos of Al as a kid are great, and the commentary from his (real life) parents gives a nice glimpse of just how Weird Al wound up as screwed up as he is. This video is a must own for any devoted Al-coholic.#1
470_3#I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but, seeing it again 20+ years later, it actually sucks. Up The Academy might have been ahead of its time back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile. No T&A. No great jokes except for the one-liners weve all heard a million times by now. The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say. (#0
9752_1#I honestly cant believe what passes for entertainment now. Death (and making fun of death), violence, sexual innuendo, adults threatening children, crudeness, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat people, and kids sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night - yup, sure sounds like a kids movie to me - NOT  Add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman possessing and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over 20 years, and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood - how sweet for kids. PARENTS - is this really what you want your kids to be watching - is this what you want to teach them about life?! This movie is too scary for young kids, and im afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario - so why rub it in their faces? As for an adult audience - you wont find it scary or amusing - just boring, contrived and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and beer drinking/womanizing boyfriends. What great material for kids - does this really sound like a childrens movie to anyone? Even the computer animation and good voice work arent enough to redeem this terrible flick. Save your money, save your time, and save your childrens minds - go rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., the Incredibles, Shrek, A Bugs Life - ANY of them are way better than this horrid film. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a childrens/family movie #0
9648_8#I liked this film very much. The story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow. There is no resolution to the story whatsoever, and you are left to wonder what really happened. Since I like that sort of film I enjoyed this. I especially like the  dating  scenes between the boys and I was drawn into their lives. And of course any film with a naked Staphane Rideau will get a couple of extra points. ;-)#1
11586_2#A Nightmare on Elm Street The Dream Child The end for the once scary Freddy. Its too sad to see him now. A clown thats not funny. A bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.#0
1528_8#Im a writer working at home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunchtime break companion - good, clean fun, good humour and nostalgia for the days of the Dick van Dyke show. How innocent we all were (and how innocent is Diagnosis Murder). I particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like Joe Mannix. The bad guys always get caught, the good guys carry on. The stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously. I hope we havent seen the last of Dick Van Dyke and family on our screens, esp. at lunchtimes #1
8430_9#Its always nice to see Angela Bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into. She is at times intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a  colored  woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers Boesman and Lenas new living area. Its not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes. Although it is based on a play, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen Cinemascope format. He also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play. Just like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have directed Angela Bassett into an Academy Award nomination. This is definitely a film worth searching for.#1
1064_10#i just got puzzled why damn FOX canceled the season3 although season2 was not as good as season1 which is excellent indeed i like it so much that i even thinking about buying DVD on Amazon.(failed! _(i am a Chinese student and its inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and $).i just hope FOX can bring back DA someday somehow!#1
4289_7#I have to be 100% honest with you fellow IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster. Doesnt Charlotte Gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way? Im in love with that woman! I got what I expectedbut only half. This film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits. Its a good example of feel good cinema.#1
7337_1#Painful. Painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting Shakespearean play. I gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldnt bare to even finish viewing it. To the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of Much Ado was, I pity you and your bored brain. May your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution. Please do not even bother with this gut wrenching, disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed Shakespeare drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place.#0
3173_3#This movie is similar to the play entitled Blithe Spirit written by Noel Coward. The plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to Cowards writing. Im surprised that movies of this nature dont acknowledge the original writers concept. I realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it is. In this case. I rather see the play.#0
2879_9#Worry not, Disney fans--this special edition DVD of the beloved Cinderella wont turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the Disney-fide adaptation of the gory Brothers Grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including  A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,   Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,  and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. The famous slipper (click for larger image) We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply wont have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking shes going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. Its a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderellas rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. Theres also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. Its a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.#1
9160_1#This movie was laughably bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and made me watch it. There are so many gaffes and goofs that its impossible to even bother getting to know the characters and the plot. How about these for example I applaud the writer/director/producer/editor/star/caterer/cast dentist/composer (and whatever else he did on this move) for actually getting a movie like this distributed. If you have nothing better to do, it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game but dont rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.#0
11530_1#In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, managed many pro wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked on 2 different wrestling TV programs and did voice-overs and commentary for many wrestling DVDs. I have NEVER witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and shoddy production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. To even list this as a wrestling video of ANY kind is an outright misuse of the term. Shot with low-dollar video cameras, its essentially home videos of kids play-fighting in back yards. The sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the acting is horrendous. The  wrestlers  wear makeshift costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves. Sometimes the  matches  are on the grass. Sometimes on a back yard trampoline. ALL are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill. In short, dont bother with this stinker. Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.#0
8455_2# Arahan  adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre. To compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of Stephen Chows films is a mistake. The attractive female lead So-Yi Yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang had done so easily in  House Of Flying Daggers . Having a Martial Arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies. To cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (See Aya Ueto in  Asumi ) unless you are a very talented director which as  Arahan  proves Seung-wan Ryoo is not.#0
8473_8#This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful  The Legend of Boggy Creek  is a follow-up in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called  Big Bay Ty  that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute, pigtailed future  Different Strokes  sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids rescue. Tom Moores casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace, astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail, drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection, and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic, restrained, unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on  Gilligans Island ) gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethards capable, sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil, achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor. Darrell Decks score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition, this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90s kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance.#1
509_3#This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany. I find  The Wooden Horse  disappointingly boring. The subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but  The Wooden Horse  is told in a very plain way. Its a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. The first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. The latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. And could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! I am disappointed by  The Wooden Horse , it wasted the potential to be a great film.#0
6751_8#Pretty good film from Preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live. In this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. #1
684_10#I grew up watching this series. I was about seven/eight years old when it was on. I still remember the 1st episode which was called  The New House.  It scared the h ll out of me! I can almost still hear that statue, laughing madly. And the ending, oh my God! The hooror spirit comes in the room for the child Yikes! This was classic TV and it was a one of a kind series. I have found a DVD collection for sale on the internet 2 actually. My question to any readers Has anyone purchased this set? Its a bootleg. Both sellers claim to have very good copy. I have a sketchy and poor DVD of  The New House  episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better,however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids. A great series, clever, scary and daringly supernatural. Thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- In fact, Id love to discuss it. Chris Walker#1
2230_10#Ive been looking for the name of this film for years. I was 14 when I believe it was aired on TV in 1983. All I can remember was it was about a teenaged girl, alone, having survived a plane crash AND surviving the Amazon. I remember people were looking for her(family) and that she knew how to take care of herself---she narrates the story and I vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin. I dont remember much else about this movie, and want to see it again--if this IS the same one--and if any of you have a copy, could you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? Id be curious to attain a copy to see if it is in fact the same film I remember. It was aired on Thanksgiving(US) in 1983, and I was going through problems of my own and this film really impacted heavily on me. Thanks in advance!#1
9027_2#Revenge on us the viewing public perhaps. I sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title. But Costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends. I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film. I had a choice of seeing this or Black Rain at the cinema thankfully i saw The other brothers movie at the cinema instead.i caught up with this turkey on video. there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune. Listen to the cd.dont watch this its awful. 1 out of 10#0
9785_7#Let me be the first non Australian to comment on this ) I got the movie for Hugo Weaving and I watched it to the end. Its one of those  drama of life  films, as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive. I guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie.#1
11558_1#Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a Euro-trash, sexy horror flick. I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new Planet of the Apes movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. Youll need it.#0
11909_1#I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time Darklight. Other than that the script was predictable and the FX were awful. Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight.#0
12088_9#Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent TV show.  I only wish they made clean television like this today I highly recommend this!#1
1488_10#This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family. Two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me #1
2757_10#If you would like to see a film of different kind, if you feel the Love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this film makes you think. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end, when love gives you directions not the brain. I am not emotional, but this film makes you feel the human being. The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my belief. The foreign movies are sometimes more interesting, yet there is not enough advertisement to make them popular.  Rang-e khoda  (The Color of The God) by Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign movies, almost with similar taste.#1
11040_7#Watched this French horror film last night and pretty much liked it. The whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. As they look through the diary, they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom. What they find out, is something completely different, and horrifying to say the least. I like low-budget horror films, that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way, and tell a good story. This movie does just that, despite taking a while to get going. The result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the ride. Not a lot of gore, but that wouldnt fit the story, although the gore it has is pretty good.#1
10526_3#Tedious girls-at-reform-school flick, which plays somewhat like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father. Once in the de facto jail, she is gang raped by her fellow female  inmates .  1/2 out of     #0
7632_3#Many people see this as a classic, but I obviously must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50s is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50s will be pretty dull too! What is it that so many people see in this? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really wont be anything to do in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But even before it closes there isnt much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. You see, theres not much for them to do either - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or to whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) elope, but nothing really happens because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast. Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic? I dont think so! 3/10#0
12298_8#After Garbos introduction to sound in Clarence Browns  Anna Christie , Jacques Feyder made a German version of the movie where all of the cast, except for Garbo, were different. While the American version is still more available in the USA and most of the American viewers have primarily seen this version, the Germna  Anna Christie  is more likely to be viewed in Europe. As I have seen both films, I feel the right to compare the two closely-knit productions. Is Jacques Feyders film different? Is it better than Clarence Browns?  If you have seen the American  Anna Christie  and have a chance to get the German version, I would highly recommend to you this movie because its a slightly different look at the story, a nice and accurate way to compare, a fine enrichment to Clarence Browns movie and, foremost, a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance Hans Junkermanns. Skaal or Prost, Hans Junkermann #1
6063_4# Masters of Horror  has proved itself a poor arena for message episodes, and while a definite case can be made for Joe Dantes Screwfly Solution (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most efforts to do so have come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive (nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox). And Pro-Life simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence; young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), seen running through the woods, is nearly hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who just happen to be driving in to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angeliques father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a stone-cold, far-right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. If for nothing else, Pro-Life accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue, but John Carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference--he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); the slow pacing builds no tension, and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl. Even when Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, guns blazing, it is a stunning non-event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a male abortion, the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary--an effort to pad out the underwritten film. The poor performances (Perlman is sadly wasted here) become an outgrowth of the script, and Carpenters direction feels exhausted, as if Pro-Life is the source of his next hot meal. By the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking#0
1956_3#This movie has one redeeming feature. At one point, after a character is attacked by an ax-wielding fairy, his brother asks him,  Why is your dick over there, Chuck?  After suffering through almost an hour of bad film, this almost made my drink come out my nose. If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy, go rent  Darkness Falls . I think its great, though a lot of other reviewers dont share my opinion. At least it sets a mood.#0
4499_9#This gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there wont spoil the fun the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where hes just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing  Reckless  -- but youll have plenty of fun. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. You wont want to miss it if youve enjoyed what came before.)#1
6849_3#This quasi J-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of Shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends. She finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that Sayoris mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike stellar J-horror films, the suspense doesnt really build, the result doesnt seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd. This movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy. Sometimes you get this at poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. You end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey, gooey tastelessness of it all. 3/10 http blog.myspace.com/locoformovies#0
10138_3#Over the years Ive seen a bunch of these straight to video Segal movies, and every one holds the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley, the entertainment level is at a low. Sure, the action sequences were amusing, but that was pretty much it. Seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like; Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Executive Decision(at least on the action standpoint), but during the past ten years, these types of movies that star Segal really do not meet his past qualifications. On the more positive side, the movie did make good use of time, like some of the action sequences and use of wit. Just when the movie seemed to just drag on, a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter. I honestly believe that more of Segals movies would do better if he wasnt the only one that fans recognize in the movie. Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing, and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses, maybe the movie will get more popular results.#0
4532_1#My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter and I have to say, I dont let her watch the new episodes on TV, because I find ALL of the characters annoying. Baby Bear AND Telly? OMgosh, How ANNOYING and useless blabber can someone think of for their skits? Elmo? Give it a rest not every kid likes him, once again, annoying and doesnt teach my child ANYTHING. Mr. Noodle? what a reject. I think the one time I turned the new show on for her, she and I were left dumber than before. The show has Definitely taken a wrong turn. I remember the Yip Yips, Kermits Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the GREAT EDUCATIONAL skits of OLD SCHOOL S.S. Sesame Street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and dumbness since Jim Hensons passing in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, funny and interactive skits it used to. I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational blabber. Way to go S.S. producers/writers you have yet another cartoony show for the parents to sit there non-creative, non-exercised kids in front of so theyll get out of their hair. Per Producers/Writers  I suggest you whip out the old muppets and start taping similar content to that of the first Sesame Streets. Lord knows I sure dont want my child talking like Baby Bear or Elmo.#0
5474_3#To be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too.. To say this was awful is to do this film a mis-service, if you want to see something that is totally execrable, you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching sickle, that is soo mind numbingly awful, its actually good,(several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though. Any road up, I enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet, just dont expect anything along the lines of jurassic park,the lost world or apocalypto.#0
3275_1#DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVED THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, AND BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE WILL DISSAPPOINT YOU BADLY! First of all, this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would not do that ever on the real series! This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest, and law-abiding. In this movie, he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, either buy the original series, or go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They both star the original cast, and are family friendly! Dont waste your time on a movie that isnt worth the CD its written on!#0
5025_2#This  clever  film was originally a Japanese film. And while I assume that original film was pretty bad, it was made a good bit worse when American-International Films hacked the film to pieces and inserted American-made segments to fool the audience. Now unless your audience is made of total idiots, it becomes painfully obvious that this was done--and done with little finesse or care about the final product. The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different. Plus, the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamera--the evil flying turtle! And although this is a fire-breathing, flying and destructive monster, there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film--in particular, film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker. They both just looked tired and ill-at-ease for being there. FYI--Apparently due to his terrific stage presence, Gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations. None of these change the central fact that he is a fire-breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really, really lame.#0
8925_3#I never much liked the Myra movie, tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Certainly Miss Welchs costume became an iconic image, though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about - I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and didnt think it had aged any better thru the years. Theres a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books, where its given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. However, IMHO, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too silly to be a turn-on, and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform, engage, OR entertain ---#0
11869_4#I dont know if the problem I had with this movie is that I was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but I believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film. If you dont have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk.#0
1439_3#I give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was well pretty boring. For about 50min we have the outline of the plot In War of the worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then was real action! This is something like Lets take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets! . And maybe deliver a message, like  Dont kill elephants! . Very ecological. I would have expected this out of a  new  Steven Segal movie, not from this The leading actress makes me think about artificial sun-tan, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I didnt see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. She just doesnt look like a 19 century woman! And in the bar, where they seek up our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the next years. Livingstone and other explorers went to central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900.. Houston, we have a problem. ) Swayze makes a nice impression.. as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. He really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions. The movie stank. Way too long and increasingly boring. dont watch it! Dont buy it! Its a waste of your money #0
2024_1#Trying to cash in on the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy dancers shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire. A contestant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as  Which team lost . . .  with three choices, A, B, or C, each which completes the phrase. The contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. The host - William Shatner, at his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the contestant if he wants to  lock into the answer  and when the contestant says yes, he picks a dancer, to whom he yells  Show me the money!  She opens a scroll that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his winnings; if he was wrong, the amount is subtracted. (So theoretically, it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing Shatner money.) There is also a  Killer Card  and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll, but he has answered properly, nothing happens. If hes answered wrong, the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he gets that one wrong, he leaves with nothing. 7/08 Guess what - I was wrong! It lasted for only 5 episodes. There IS hope for the world.#0
1117_10#If you ever have the chance to see Sandra Bernhard live in person, you better move on it sweetie. I saw her last year in Los Angeles at the opening of her Everything Bad and Beautiful tour and i still cant believe that i was in the first row, and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show. She is now in New York with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner,  Without You Im Nothing . We have lost Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, Nina Simone, but Sandra is still with us. Patti Smith is missing in action, but not Sandra. Barbara Streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but Sandra more than makes up for where Babs leaves off. Okay, i want it known, Ms. Bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more. I really wanted to push this film because of its truth, honesty, humor, eclectic songs (ranging from Laura Nyro, Sylvester, Nina Simone, Prince), and a script that defines the decadence, joy, sadness, ups and downs of the 70s and 80s. It is my opinion that many (and i mean, MANY) comics have lifted, okay outright stolen, so much from this show if not from Sandra herself. I wont name names but come on, people, you and i know who they are. See, the thing is, Bernhard plays by her own rules. This movie shows, as does her live performances, that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business, as well as pushing forward. Her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs (during the time of Miles Davis,Coltrane,Monk), 70s TV shows, intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from Judy Garland to Joan Jett. Most comedians couldnt even touch where Sandra is coming from or going to. So, here i was, a year ago, watching Sandra at the Silent Movie Theater, in total awe and joy. I wanted to meet her after the show, give her something that meant something to me, that, hopefully would mean something to her. But i listen to my copy of Giving Til it Hurts, and just thank her in a prayer, of sorts for making me laugh, making me think, making me FEEL. You cant deny this ladys presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage. Shes still here, damn it, even after the release of Without You Im Nothing, some 15 years ago. And she looks great, by the way. I know this firsthand, walking from the theater one audience member said to another,  She is SO FUNNY..and she still looks incredible  If you cant experience her live yet, please see this movie. As for me, I do hope that Sandra will see this. Youve meant a heck of a lot to me, gotten me through some tough crazy times. If you can send me an email, please do. If not, knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so, is enough for me. Come on, people, give it up for the Lady #1
7741_1#Josh Hartnetts dead eyes, the thick writing of it, and Harrison Ford being in a buddy-cop comedy ! Heres 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it, and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better. Its a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars glamour, and as being a Buddy-cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself ! Guess who ?!), and a Buddy-Cop destroyer more than movie ! God, dont make me, or my children, live enough to witness (Hollywood Homicide  Part 2) ! At last, look at Harrison Fords performance, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we didnt.#0
4602_3#A film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. Then they double cross him. Meanwhile he falls in love with the dead mans wife, and, without her knowing hes the killer, moves in with her. Then he  accidentally  kills her when she finds out. Then, in a WALKING TALL kind of heroism, he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him. The first problem is that, by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment, the drifter loses all sense of sympathy, worthiness, and heroism. We cant accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center. We just cant care about that kind of guy. And the wife (nicely played by the fetching Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff in EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people, similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter (despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband). And, when she finds out hes the guy  what does she do? She locks him inside her house (as if ALL houses had locks you cant open from INSIDE) with her and proceeds to berate him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is terrific in a role as a beefy thug. Director Stuart Gordon did so much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.#0
12337_7#Poor Ivy Though to the manner born, she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s, when rigid Victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges, this uncertain status vexes her unduly. The Gretorexes (for so they are called) dont know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him. Luckily, one of the beaux she still strings along (Patric Knowles) is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison, with which she bids her hubby farewell. The fact that it implicates Knowles doesnt phase her a bit, even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead. The turning of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles mother (the redoubtable Lucile Watson); and Knowles loyal housekeeper (Una OConnor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama; Fontaines luminous face supplies the rest.#1
7738_8#After Dark, My Sweet is a great, modern noir, filled with seedy characters, dirt roads, and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the South, where the men glisten and the ladies, um, glisten too. Why? Because its hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least the men do - sweaty women leave me clammy).  Why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead. Shes not bad, per se, but shes not Angelica Huston or Anette benning (see the adaptation of Jim Thompsons The Grifters if you dont know what Im talking about - besides its a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir - its the best of the 1990s and challenges Blood Simple for the title of best since Chinatown). She simply doesnt have the chops (or the looks for that matter) and though she and Patric have some chemistry, I dont have it with her. So there.#1
6079_2#the tortuous emotional impact is degrading, whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all. This movie has a plot, but it is all evil from start to end. This is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie. teen killing - bad preteen sex - bad emotional battering - bad animal cruelty - bad psychological torture - bad parental neglect - bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red, blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace, what a bad mistake to make, or to watch it is UGLY#0
771_7#I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. Mainly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I do think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just didnt have complex roles. I applaud Puyas entering the movie business. I dont know why, but I think hes a good guy, I just hope hell be a good actor. I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, it should have gotten the  Better luck next time  award. (bafta=good luck in Romanian).#1
8510_1#When we were in junior high school, some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs. It was considered funny then. But the producers, directors and cast of  Semana Santa  ( Angel of Death  in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they are STILL setting them off. But let me warn you--do not be the next victim! Step away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. Tbere are not many good leg shots of Mira (the only high points I could find in the film) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality, delivering a mishmash of badly-done dialogue with embarrassing  Spanish  accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production.#0
6273_1#This was a cute movie until the ending. The ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive/aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her. It is not by chance that she was sitting behind the drivers wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back. This movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them. It was a despicable movie for that reason.#0
2278_10#Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this I was expecting a huge disappointment. Instead I got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elequence, and above all else the crushing sadness of Vonneguts novel. Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made. It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.#1
3840_3#Id heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as wed both heard that this was a terrifying film, really scary. How disappointed was I?? VERY  Apart from that one scene (we all know which bit) NOTHING happened  I was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes, like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something. A big let down after all the hyped reviews (#0
11702_10#A Thief in the Night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers. I have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting God. They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night. Do not listen! These movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation, but theyre also fun to watch in their simplicity. They are in fact low-budget and that is a little obvious, but not all too obvious upon first viewing. I had no clue because I really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70s included low-budgets all the time. Just like these whiners who complain about the movie. These people must be full grown adults. Im thirteen, and you dont see me whining, especially since I was exactly like Patty before I re-accepted Christ into my heart. For those who havent seen it, if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a Christian movie instead of stereo-typical everyone else is wrong movies, than youll enjoy A Thief In The Night. Dont knock it before you try it. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.#1
9431_2#Basic slasher movie premise, 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family. YAWN. The ending  dude! that psycho is deranged - why couldnt the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes unfortunately that is it - My advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player - for me I am going back to sleep.#0
11244_10#One of my best films ever, maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many of hazels concerts, but the film was a good story line and very good acting by hazel and a up and coming Phil Daniels not sure about his latest project Eastenders   excellent performance by lots of unknown actors who if you keep your eyes peeled will see them in many of the UK soaps today exp Carver out of the Bill, the more i watch it the more of them i spot, well if you have not seen it yet have a night in with the video, dont forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head Mochanian style.Enjoy#1
2910_4#The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional (for him) role. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. Its true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble - his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings. So Hanks took a role I wouldnt have expected him in, and he pulled it off well. Although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of the story) its really very dark throughout, that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall. I have to confess that while I appreciated Hanks performance, the movie as a whole just didnt pull me in. 4/10#0
