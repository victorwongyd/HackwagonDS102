11524_7#This is a quirky little movie, and I have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well. Not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about the journey, then I think youll like this one.#1
11917_8#Yeah, the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever I see it. Thats just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating. A very nice family movie with - I concede - a rather corny happy end. But hey, it doesnt really matter, the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes.#1
2171_10#A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Wonder if this film is already out in DVD, because it must be seen in Widescreen version. Saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since then forgot it.I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances.The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.#1
10009_9#When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves. That being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood S~#1
3580_4#The memory banks of most of the reviewers here mustve short-circuited when trying to recall this Cubic Zirconia of a gem, because practically everyone managed to misquote Lloyd Bochners Walter Thornton, when in a fit of peevish anger, he hurls the phallic garden nozzle at his new wife, Jerilee Randall-Thornton, (a nearly comatose Pia Zadora) which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the moviebut Im getting ahead of myself. In any case, poor Lloyd couldve been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put-upon co-star. THE LONELY LADY is in that category, and represents itself very well, considering the circumstances. Here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen souffl√© Pia Zadora, a marginal singer/actress so determined to be taken seriously, that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers, (which this movie most certainly did!); a somewhat high-profile novel written by the Trashmaster himself, Harold Robbins (of THE CARPETBAGGERS and DREAMS DIE FIRST fame); a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all, that they tried to play this dreck like it was Clifford Odets or Ibsen; plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck, (and was probably contractually obligated NOT to demand the use of the Alan Smithee moniker to protect what was left of his reputation.) Like Lamont Johnsons LIPSTICK, Meir Zarchis I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, Roger Vadims BARBARELLA, Paul Verhoevens SHOWGIRLS or the Grandmammy of Really Bad Film-making, Frank Perrys MOMMY DEAREST, THE LONELY LADY is still often-discussed, (usually with disgust, disbelief, horrified laughter, or a unique combination of all three), yet also defies dissection, description or even the pretzel logic of Hollyweird. Nobodys sure how it came to be, how it was ever released in even a single theater, or why its still here and nearly impossible to get rid of, but take it or leave it, it IS here to stay. And I dont think that lovers of really good BAD movies would have it any other way.#0
9418_2#This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re-naming. It doesnt work at all. Firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong. Its very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end. But there is also (and that may have to do with the cuts) an uneasy moving between genres. It starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the ending may be funny but its also so blunt that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence (what little there is). So the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all. You can also see that in the very unsteady character development.You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles rather than one.#0
7039_7#War Inc. is a funny but strange film. The actors are likable, the film is likable also, but I dont know how to describe the plot. I will go into the plot later on. This is a movie with some weird casting choices. Besides John Cusack as a hit-man, which we saw years ago in Grosse Point blank which I liked.  War,Inc.3.5/5#1
4617_10#Ive been a Jennifer Connelly fan since Phenomena, and after I heard about seven minutes in heaven, I saw it as soon as I could. The movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal I loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie #1
6565_8#I know the film snobs are snorting. But if youre looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B-movie jungle, try  Jake Speed . I have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy,or bogging down the movie by trying too hard. Not every movie has to be the latest  Citizen Kane . And trust me,Wells was an original. So lets remember that sometimes, movies are for fun.Not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically. But just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our heros live in a celluloid dimension.#1
9379_1#This movie . . . I dont know. Why they would take such an indellible character as Pippi Longstocking and cast the singularly charmless Tami Erin, I will never know. Why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects, then not bother to edit it properly, I will never know. Why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period, and sometimes bizarrely not, why they commissioned SUCH bad songs, why the script doesnt make any sense whatsoever (not even on a silly, childrens film level) . . . . what were they thinking?? Nothing about this movie is quite as it should be. Every single part is dubbed (and always poorly,) every sound effect is slightly wrong, every edit is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. It does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it NEVER captures the magic that is Astrid Lindgrens creation.#0
7627_10#I remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland, it all came flooding back. Why this hasnt had a Video or DVD release yet? Its sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been. In fact this is the one John Carpenter film that hasnt been released. In fact i havent seen it on the TV either since the day i watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role he was born to play. John carpenters break from horror brought this gem that id love the TV to play again. It is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes. Belting out most of Elviss greatest hits with gusto. I think this also was the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big trouble in little china, and Escape from L.A. Someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life, which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has. If this doesnt get released then we are gonna be in Heartbreak Hotel.#1
3653_10#Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this commonplace movie???  The cast gives some good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a girl without mother and Justin Whalin, a guy eternally lessened by his bother), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can NOT believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer) are you CRAZY??? #1
2168_1#Having read another review, I thought this movie would actually be good. I do enjoy the  B  movies, but this couldnt even be classed as such. The photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie. But the editing left much to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job. The music was awful, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting. If the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off. Unfortunately, Ive seen better acting in porn flicks. If you want to see a  B  vampire movie, check out Blood Ties. Youll be much more entertained.#0
311_1#I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for the writing, if thats what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell  I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $10,000 and they were way under. Did Wallmart get a good deal on this? Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend anymore #0
2644_1#The Sentinel represents everything about the soul-lessness of Hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. I cannot possibly think of one good thing about it, its all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, undeserving public. If youre a glutton for punishment then dont let me stop you. But it IS time and money you wont be getting back.#0
8926_1#I saw  Myra Breckinridge  when it first came out in 1970. I was a healthy 20-year-old at the time, who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. On top of that, I had read the Gore Vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie at a local drive-in and about half way through I was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe Id die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. It wasnt  smart  or  trendy , it was gross and sloppy. All the actors were tone deaf and the director didnt have the slightest idea what he was doing. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in movie history. As one reviewer here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud, which would never do for the legendary Ms. West. Oh no, the plot is changed so she sexually beats HIM up, very believable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every DAY of her age. I could go on, but why? It was an awful movie. Bluto#0
7683_10#I LOVED GOOD TIMES with the rest of many of you. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL commentary. The writers on THIS show were fantastic and the Actors were beyond TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary)What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I believe I remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it first aired and I was a tiny thingit was so sad to me..). Love, a TV LAND original sitcom junkie of the 70s and 80s (as they sing in  ALL in the Family those were the days#1
5727_1#I just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film I have done on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films I have ever seen. After reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible. But in the mean time avoid this like the plague. I want my 81 mins back with interest. (At least I didnt pay to watch it.)#0
5827_2#Dont get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos its ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is no worse than the US meat trade or the Scottish haggis cull), it stinks cos its pretentious tosh, the sort of up-its-own-behind guff that gets modern art a bad name. That said, there are some stunning images, but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so thats no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted, and then, just when you thinks its finished, it starts again. I saw it it in a porn cinema in Rome which had been hired for the weekend to show Barneys film works, which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the dirty-old-men-in-macs brigade, but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard-stroking Bjork fans were to be honest, everyone might have had a lot more fun if theyd just shown one of the pornoes!#0
2122_4#Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccinos project is rather mediocre. The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical. Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritus Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks. The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easily on through the movie. Thats too bad, because Seven Pounds could have been as authentically  good  if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands.#0
503_2#After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I found NO Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie. Give this one a miss.#0
8067_1#First off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling. Most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end  Some people want a movie that makes them  think  through the entire thing, to which I say More power to you   I on the other hand just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stinker, entertainment it is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. Seems that most here agree also. Most of this didnt make any sense, and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and.well I guess you see where this is going. Avoid, this one sucks.bad #0
752_1#Is it possible to give a movie NO STARS? I suppose not. However many stars IMDb displays this just think zero and youll get my drift. Director and photographer Timothy Hines didnt have much of a budget compared to Spielbergs Herculean effort with the same material (rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made), but that need not be an insurmountable handicap. Ive seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring ( Soldier and Saints  is a recent example). With hard work, integrity and, above all, talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of Wells novella -- and at fraction of what was spent by Dreamworks on its  War of the Worlds . Unfortunately, Hines failed in all these departments. Even if he had had Spielbergs budget and Tom Cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal hes foisted on us. Next we have acting, or more precisely too much acting. Whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out. Evidently Hines thinks hes getting a bargain -- More fleeing in terror over there! You, quaking behind that tree, lets have a real conniption fit this take. You call that writhing in agony? Nonsense, my grandmother can writhe better -- Nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink. They arent even good amateurs. But this neednt prove fatal. Many a good movie has been made with rancid acting. Thats what directors are for. And editors. Which brings up another point¬Ö Who the hell let Tim Hines edit this cheese factory? If Americas butchers were as adept at meat cutting as Hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef. In spite of the near three-hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie -- not sequences, but single frames, creating a herky-jerky effect thats nauseating to watch. Maybe Hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890s. If he was I can say he doesnt know how to do it.#0
9092_3#Friz Frelengs Speedy Gonzalez was the second cartoon to feature the title character after Robert McKimsons Cat-tails for Two. In that cartoon, Speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. Despite looking significantly more handsome, Speedy never developed into much of a character. A big hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not a classic character make and thats pretty much all Speedy ever had going for him. Nevertheless, the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studios latter days. While these early Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently (rather oddly) paired up with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula. In this self-titled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat. Although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon, Sylvesters role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable. undemanding role of pursuer. This was always a problem in the Tweety cartoons too but Speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come. Despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs, Speedy Gonzalez won an Oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born.#0
5115_1#This had to be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen and Im 64 years old and a football fan. I went expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes into it, I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie (particularly the acting) could have gotten into a theater. About half way through, I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie. Although I was a little offended (and can see how some could be VERY offended if they were not Christian) at being preached to in a movie theater, it wasnt that big a deal. It was, however, a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of the acting. It is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater. Do I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I attend a movie? No. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not #0
6640_1#I find it rather useless to comment on this  movie  for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.Its similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it. But since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance   On the other hand this movie (among others) has some value whatsoever, an educational one for it sets the example for   How NOT to make a movie.  #0
5944_1#Not exactly my genre, this straight-to-DVD street fight action is one I only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers. Im relatively open minded, and quite a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat back ready to enjoy myself. A run of the mill, film-by-numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to DVD status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything weve seen time and time again. And not even particularly well.#0
9229_2#This is a movie about making a movie. Such movies may be entertaining, but they need some substance, to do so. It did not happen here, I am afraid. Mr Coppola did not inherit his fathers skills, unfortunately (neither did his sister, who can however make movies which one might watch). Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You must be really joking#0
8185_2#Oh my. I decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends, wanting to watch one of those mild, feel-good Christmas movies, and I walk out disgusted. The movie failed. Full-stop. Paul Giamatti who I consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly, along with Vince Vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine. They try and turn a Christmas movie, into some new-style. Sort of bad, mixed with good, but it all turned out very wrong. The first ten or so minutes werent too bad, but once we saw Santa, it was over. It didnt get any better, the rate stayed the same, there was NO character development, and certainly is one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Dont watch it, whatever you do.#0
5467_2#What to say about this movie. Well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people. Two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the schools basement. That is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever. Though that is not fair, some people like Tromas movies and they can watch it if they want. Troma movies for me though, are the worst movies there are out there. I just watched this one out of morbid curiosity.#0
10742_1#i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago.what a disaster .the acting was atrocious.there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon.this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didnt ring true.supposedly a modern reworking of the Hitchcock original  Lifeboat .i think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it.from what i was able to suffer through,there is nothing compelling in this movie.it boasts a few semi big names,but they put no effort into their characters.but,you know,to be fair,it was nobodys fault really.i mean,im pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion. LOL.it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along.but for me,im not willing to spend at least three days to find out.so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon,avoid this stinker/ 1/10#0
6303_8#Having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer I had to see this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present it had to be good. And it delivered. Overall, the movie is not crack-you-up funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is, in a my eyes, a classic. SPOILER At the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see Rockwell and Washington stare at Jeter is just fantastic. This is just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude is using a chair to barricade his door, but forgets the door turns outward! END SPOILER Just go see this movie, you wont be disappointed.#1
2668_1#do not be suckered into renting this movie. It has nothing to do with an escape from death row, despite the (english) title. I cant think of a single good thing to say about the movie. Poor acting, poor editing, poor directing laughable  plot , and the sound/music was so irritating, its a wonder this movie doesnt come with a warning label. The only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for its historical cheesiness quality. They just dont make films this bad anymore.#0
4114_1#There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And WHY DO THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS BAD??? The premise is absurd. Thre acting is one dimensional. The special effects are overdone. And the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots Hollywood ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad it didnt happen that way. Tempted to turn it off several times, I stuck with it to see just how bad it could get. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, dismal scenario.It is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive-in in off season. Apart from the general awfulness of the film, I worry deeply about its impact on young audiences. The Americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!#0
1363_1#This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a  motion  picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same  story  with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. Its just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching  Love In the Time of Money , but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people walk out before me.#0
3774_8#In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Teds excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future. The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as I appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot arent as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.#1
422_1#A lot of death happens in the wild. You dont need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out! But does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this fascination with gruesome death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film!  If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review, why not focus on Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socializing; playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, like mouth brooding; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty, and why not be much more well-rounded - and focus on delight and inspiration, instead?#0
4624_4#This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) It wasnt an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. The Twilight Zone always stretched the imagination and credulity. Normally no one cared. But this episode seemed hamstrung by a Calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine, or downright carelessness.#0
9504_2#The only reason I watched this film was because I had recently read Robert Houghs less than perfect, but interesting, fictionalised account of the life of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in a less than flattering light. Historicaly interesting.#0
8621_10#Excellent episode movie ala Pulp Fiction. 7 days - 7 suicides. It doesnt get more depressing than this. Movie rating 8/10 Music rating 10/10#1
12456_10#This movie is definately one of my favorite movies in its kind. The interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen. It treats themes like duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like few films have done and, unfortunately, none that I can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious, down to the essential, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. No such scenes are present or needed. The argument is sand honest to the spectator; An important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience. No, this is not miss Marble A note of congratulations for the music is in order A film to watch and savor every minute, not just to see.#1
9046_8#I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, Ive been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, hell crack an Oscar one day Sure, its a basic family movie, but thats a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids youll all have a lot of good laughs.#1
4999_9#Got to this show late - believe it was the 3rd, and final episode, when first watched it - and was blown away by a social commentary that hasnt been seen on American TV since All in the Family. Thank You BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla#1
5658_4# Laugh, Clown Laugh  released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. That kind of  ick  factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonettas affections with a young and handsome Count Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is being (until he reveals it himself at the end). The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career. While I adore Chaneys brilliance as an actor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy.#0
935_4#Users who have rated this movie so highly simply cant have seen enough good films to compare it with. Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie. The idea that it shows the way to the Bond franchise is utter crap. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.#0
1258_9#As usual, Sean Connery does a great job. Lawrence Fishburn is good, but I have a hard time not seeing him as Ike Turner.#1
5323_3#I cant believe that in the 34 prior comments, nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip-off of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster. Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is left in the lurch. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff. Technicolor transfer to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus would be rolling over in her grave. Check out the paperboy. Recognize him? But, its historically interesting to see the roots of Rock n Roll. Also interesting is Ewells introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.#0
4625_2#How could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10? How could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher? Who is voting here? I can only assume it is primarily kids -- very young kids. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid; the acting is hard to even think of as acting; the characters are characterless; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this one rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast, I suggest you read a book instead.#0
4638_10#I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. my Hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles were very useful, I didnt feel lost at any point in the movie. You tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. This movie blew me away  It depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today A homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously. The dilemma, the emotions entailed. The movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side! an absolute must see #1
4566_1#SPOILER WARNING There are some minor spoilers in this review. Dont read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film. Theres so much wrong here. As mentioned, the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses, which these kids are not. The website, the cartoon image, the computer chip, even the stuff they are being taught in school, are far too advanced for these kids. The acting by most of the cast, especially Kevin Kilner, is terrible. Some familiar faces are wasted. Dom DeLuise plays the evil bank owner, but his part is a throwaway. He has one good scene with Alexandra Paul (who shows she has the ability to act) in which he explains his motives, but nothing more. And Rich Little is wasted in a small role as a judge. Theres even some offensive and uncalled for anti-Russian jokes. But the greatest atrocities are the hard-hammered themes. These themes show up in many of The Disney Channels films, but never before have these ultra-conservative messages been pounded so strongly. The typical `overworking parent idea is really pushed hard, and after delivering it inappropriately in `The Ultimate Christmas Present, seeing it again sours my mood. Family relations are important, but Disney must stop this endless preaching, because working is important to maintaining a workable family, too. Except for cancelling activities thanks to work, the father didnt come across as that bad, but I found it offensive when the grandmother told him `I dont like what I see. Just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents MUST marry if they want to raise their kids right. Enter Alexandra Paul, whose character, while important to the plot, is there solely to be the love interest for the father. This offensiveness only proves that the Disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the Disney script barrel. Instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud, wait for the next Disney Channel movie. It has to be better than this. Zantaras score 1 out of 10.#0
9487_8#The first time I saw this film, I was in shock for days afterwards. Its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention, helped by good acting and some really intriguing music. The ending, quite simply, had me gasping. First rate!#1
1433_10#Brilliant execution in displaying once and for all, this time in the venue of politics, of how  good intentions do actually pave the road to hell . Excellent #1
12_1#All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about its redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.#0
10483_8#Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material. But then it doesnt try to be anything it is not. A fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners, a stellar and very funny performance by Peter OToole, a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright. The bands performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a deft, comical manner. The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely. From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads. A good example is the comment about the  strange baseball-like game , well my dear American, that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant US band was very funny for those that do know cricket. Also no, you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said  oh yes!  to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time  oh no  also referring to the money. Jeez, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people All-in-all I enjoyed it and had some great laughs! Well worth seeing.#1
3915_2#This movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply confusing. The acting cant possibly overcome the script which removes the characters motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. DONT SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.#0
3167_7#This is one of those films that explore the culture clash of Eastern born people in Westernized cultures.  #1
12255_10#Of the spate of Austen films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, more even than  Persuasion,  which was the one that converted me to Austeniana. Before seeing this  Emma  I had seen two previous versions, but in one Emma seemed all wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other she seemed half wrong, like a possible impostor, whereas here she seemed just right, young and silly and stubborn. In general I thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well; indeed it is one of the sweetest, merriest things I have ever seen, rather in the nature of a Christmas treat. The script is unusually well formed, and the adapters additions, like the shaft of light that reveals Harriet to Emma in church, are all in keeping. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would have expected, but I enjoyed him very much he strongly brings out the plain-spoken, practical side of the character, in contrast with Emmas affectations, and his choleric outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of almost Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emmas prot√©g√© is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be. And as in the same producers  Pride and Prejudice,  care is taken that the eventual couplings of characters can be believed--uniquely in some cases. For me this production was and remains a delight.#1
11059_9#The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shellys  Ill Take You There  is not overt, but clearly has ties to his work (Shelly has acted in two of Hartleys films). Not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative, but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light. Though this film is not ironic on the whole (thank God), the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss. With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies,  Ill See You There  is a great indie-film that doesnt stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion. Aware that Bill desperately wants to see Rose, Bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first. On the way, she proceeds to hold Bill prisoner with his own gun (a Pinkerton Detective, no less). An imbroglio of angst, resentment, redemption, passion and violence ensue as Bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of Ray and Rose of course, with a few stops along the way.#1
7776_7#Does any one know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stacks might have been a Masseratti.Rock Hudsons character told his father he was taking a job in Iraq ,isnt that timely? I have had Dorthy Malone in my spank bank most of my life ,maybe this was the film that impressed me.Loren Bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out-acted Malone but Maloness part made a more sensational impact so she got the Oscar for best supporting role.Was Lorens part considered a leading role?Old man Hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoons of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up.In time,being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten,looking for attention,so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off.An ancient morality tale.But seriously,what were those sports cars?#1
3738_2#Thats what the title should be, anyway. This proves one thing the actors, directors, and whoever helped make this movie certainly arent  Made .#0
2485_1#There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof it reminds you just how bad bad can be. We often see films which we describe as  pretty awful  or  not much good , but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films arent  good  they are no way as stinkingly bad as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It could have been a serendipitous find but it wasnt this is so utterly clich√©d, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly acted that Im surprised everyone involved hasnt been arrested and sent down for 10 years. God, its awful. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. This isnt one of them. It is simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall throw it in the bin.#0
1535_9#Thankfully as a student I have been able to watch  Diagnosis Murder  for a number of years now. It is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing. The main cast gave good performances and Dick Van Dykes entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM was the fast pace, witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score. Sadly it has been unfairly compared to  Murder, She Wrote . DM is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it is gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of feelgood, family friendly cop shows. Now there is just depressing gritty ones.#1
5352_7#This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know that, Ive saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review. If you dont like Arnold, then you wont like this movie. If the case is the other, then you will very probably like it. Its as simple as that. If youve seen Arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one. Enjoy.#1
7491_7#Years ago, I found a  bargain bin  copy of this film for a buck or two. In so many ways, this is quite fitting, as when it was made back in 1933, it was truly a cheaply made film by the  poverty row  studio, Majestic. However, while the film is rather derivative, it is STILL well worth watching and provides a few surprises. Overall, for fans of old horror films, this is excellent and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, its probably pretty skip-able.#1
7879_4#First off, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing to me. The movie cuts out some characters, and misses a lot of the main points of the book. It skips around a lot, and doesnt explain anything in detail. If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie to me, was the ending. The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of  melting  together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs. To sum up, I dont think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.#0
5370_7#Of all Arnolds mid-80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isnt more controversial as the last, its a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have court-appointed theatrical attorneys or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows. This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.851 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters Ive seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a Meet the Stalkers gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.#1
10361_7#Once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended, youll find that its not half bad. The plot is engaging and interesting, and the pacing is fast, with this covering many situations, and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken. Where this really stands out is the acting. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. Its also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film, and even those who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent. The cinematography and editing are nice enough, but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff. This movies story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling. While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture, I understand that it is quite close to the truth. There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this. It is, at times, a downright great courtroom drama. I recommend this to any fellow fan of such. 7/10#1
4578_1#Another cult strikes again. This isnt a spoiler, because the REAL ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly-long, pseudo-scientific infomercialRamthas School of Enlightenment. When any religion/philosophy needs to hide behind an OZ-like screen of deceit, I walk away. Thank Ramtha I watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a  friend to have wasted precious resources on this New-Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they  truly believe they can walk on water  enough to take that guidance to its  logical  conclusionin other words; walk, drownor shut up -) As a movieit deserves a strong  1  on its entertainment value, especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history (the photographers roommateeeeeeek!). If you must see this film, borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it.#0
5863_1#I really cant believe this movie is not in the IMDB worst 250, it is absolutely terrible. When I originally saw it I remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it. We were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible. By the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was. Dont be like them, just pass this by. Im sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie.#0
3483_9#Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of Georgian character. This film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness. It will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities.#1
103_7#when i read other comment,i decided to watch this movie Finally,i recommend to watch this movieAnd i hope Youll love it enjoy D#1
7333_3#I enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes, but 20-minutes in I was liberally applying the fast-forward button. Far too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walking from room to room, down hallways, through doors and down the street, and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused. Gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay). It might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that I hadnt heard said in many other films before, or if the ending wasnt - disappointingly - the one I had predicted three minutes into the film (atypical for an independent/smaller studio film). At least its heart was in the right place - it wasnt your standard formulaic Hollywood manipulative nonsense.#0
4988_7#Mans Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called Hoovervilles named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in his administration. The proposition of this film is that a mans home is still his castle even when its just a shack in a Hooverville. Mans Castle is grim look at the Great Depression, not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.#1
635_1#Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luises character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Munis character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luises performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.#0
8208_2# Hey everybody! Ive got an idea, we found this egg-shaped thingie from outer space so why dont we thaw it out and open it up?   Yes, I know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race, but hey, I want to know whats in it .  And nobody tell NASA, they might take it away from us .  Wow this thingie gives off vibes!   Yes,really strong ones on contact so dont touch it but its okay to cut it open .  Hi there handsome, check out my nips . (Later that day);  DO NOT OPEN   Uh oh, we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we dont have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here.  Ive never seen such organic technology!   Yeah, lemme take this stick and stab it. .  Im getting out of here, I dont care if I do kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, nobodys nukkin me!   Look! its the friendly aliens from  The Abyss   They want us to come with them . THE END#0
3206_4#I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie in the Cebuano language. (Not dialect as most Filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as. As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are to each other.) But I was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie. Being a Canadian, of Cebuano parents, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I was further excited to hear that it wasnt another stupid action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love these types of movies. But alas, I was short-changed. And whats with so many Filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother???#0
9217_7#This truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters, just about every voluptuous middle-aged female in Hollywood, and a touching, funny love story. The Capomezzas and the Malacicis are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also at opposite--extreme--ends of the taste scale. Their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of Romeo and Juliet. Naturally, they fall in love. On stage! The mayhem and confusion that this causes, as the parents feud with each other and their kids, is played out for us against the backdrop of the Capomezzas magnificently tasteless home, and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings. If you are sensitive about Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all of the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love it #1
10526_3#Tedious girls-at-reform-school flick, which plays somewhat like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father. Once in the de facto jail, she is gang raped by her fellow female  inmates .  1/2 out of     #0
1747_10#This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didnt see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better put together movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a whole bunch of T&A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie  If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roepers review of this movie is right on. I mean, I dont really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.#1
923_9#I never saw it on TV but rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found that it was available. I had high expectations, and was not disappointed. Its funny, and the animation is excellent. That level of quality I would only have expected from feature films, so Im surprised at some of the bad comments on it. Maybe the DVD release had improved animation? One bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. Im an adult, and I really appreciate that it is for adults. It isnt only kids who like cute animated characters. It is nowhere near  raunchy  as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents wouldnt want their young children to see it. Im very disappointed that it was cancelled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or perhaps a movie.#1
918_2#When George C. Scott played the title role in  Patton,  you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist, shooting at German dive bombers with a revolver, and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike. The most action we get from Gregory Peck as  MacArthur,  a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment, is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his. Ive never been sold by Pecks standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars; he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best-known roles. But its unfair to dock him so much here, as he gets little help defining MacArthur as anything other than a speechifying bore. Except for two scenes, one where he rails against the surrender of the Philippines ( He struck Old Glory and ran up a bedsheet! ) and another where he has a mini-breakdown while awaiting the U.S. invasion of Inchon, inveighing against Communists undermining him at the White House, Peck really plays Peck here, not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet  American Caesar.  The real MacArthur might have been worthy of such a comparison. What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown.#0
3199_10#OK, I dont really think that Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines, because they kick ass. They just conflict with each other. Sorry to keep on blabbing.#1
5025_2#This  clever  film was originally a Japanese film. And while I assume that original film was pretty bad, it was made a good bit worse when American-International Films hacked the film to pieces and inserted American-made segments to fool the audience. Now unless your audience is made of total idiots, it becomes painfully obvious that this was done--and done with little finesse or care about the final product. The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different. Plus, the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamera--the evil flying turtle! And although this is a fire-breathing, flying and destructive monster, there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film--in particular, film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker. They both just looked tired and ill-at-ease for being there. FYI--Apparently due to his terrific stage presence, Gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations. None of these change the central fact that he is a fire-breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really, really lame.#0

88_2#I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, theyre all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didnt seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; theyre both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.#0
2874_10#Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. One day, a ball is to be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance of going, because her stepmother and stepsisters wont let her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is off to the ball, with the warning to return home by midnight. At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving behind one of her glass slippers. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince later get married, and they live happily ever after. Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success, and it continues to charm audiences to this day. It has a well-written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including  A Dream is A Wish Your Heart Makes ,  So This Is Love , and the great  Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo , help tell the story. This was my favorite movie growing up, and it hasnt lost any of its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD release is the best way to appreciate this film, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music video, vintage radio programs, and a restored print of the movie #1
8644_7#     = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten I almost feel like Im cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving  KALIFORNIA  a     rating. But the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it. I do believe that everyone should see this movie though. I truly do.#1

2345_4#I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson,Lauren Becall,Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was terrible- just bloody horrible- he was supposed to be a charming jet-setting millionaire- instead he came off like a jerk from the word go- the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3  romantic  leads had no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress- although her campy tramp character was boring- think the older sister from Splendour in The Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. Had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on Get Smart#0
6426_4#I found the documentary entitled Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control to be a fairly interesting documentary. The documentary contained four  mini  documentaries about four interesting men. Each one of these men was extremely involved with his job, showing sheer love and enjoyment for ones job. The video was filmed in a very creative way though. I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music.#0
11188_10#I am a big fan of Stephen Kings work, and this film has made me an even greater fan of King. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They have just moved into a new house, and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. The Creeds new neighbor Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. That burial ground is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human being (or any kind of pet) up in the burial ground, they would come back to life. The only problem, is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person, theyre evil. Soon after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary, everything starts to go to hell. I wont explain anymore because I dont want to give away some of the main parts in the film. The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good, but needed a little bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this movie, mainly because it was so original and gripping. This film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie, and frightening. One of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back, was in fact the make-up effects. There is one character in this film that is truly freaky. That character is  Zelda.  This particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Creeds sister who passed away years before, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie isnt generally scary because she isnt talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the living      out of me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scares, some pretty good acting, first rate plot, and mesmerizing make-up. This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.#1
10055_7#It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact¬Ö Even by todays standards, the film is interesting and provocative¬Ö  Artistically, however, this is perhaps his most complete¬Ö His later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas  Therese and Isabelle  was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism#1
10832_10#If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy in this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in main role. The story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and song  The Flame Still Burns  is perfect. You have to watch it.#1
8223_1#Definitely, definitely the worst film Ive ever seen, no questions asked! Contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, since its an independent, low-budget film, but cmon already ¬ñ the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying. ¬Öoh and by the way, this movie is NOTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand-held camera ¬ñ this is an effect and not a trait! Used cleverly it can be breathtaking, but in this case its an excuse for inadequate cinematography.#0
1488_1#I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie ismy cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this. Not the worst acting Ive ever seen, but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to be desired. There wasnt a single scare moment in the movie, with the exception of when they were watching the movie Halloween on the TV. All around, it seems like it couldve been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss as I didnt recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I couldve said oh yeah, there she is. Im so glad I saw this in a hotel and didnt pay for it as Id be real ticked if I had payed a cent to see this. I normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this one is an exception. Its so bad that its not even that amusing so-good-its-bad.its just plain bad.#0
1952_8#I got to see the movie   On Thin Ice  on the television in India.. I must say the movie was really well done, and really sent a chill down my spine.. the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted A must must watch movie.. for everyone#1
12169_1#This is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage, that no doubt wants to be a Friday the 13th (1980) clone. The poster for this movie makes it look like theres going to be some sort of a cross between Jason and Freddy, which is likely to attract movie-goers. There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie. It just makes me sad, just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers (1988) on video or DVD, and waste their time with this sad, cynical, depressing movie. And the sickest thing is--and by not giving too much away--the movie simply sets up room for a sequel. Well, why not? Theyve probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies. I missed out on the original Sleepaway Camp (1983), and, after watching its first sequel, I will hopefully stay away from the other sequels, as well as the original. And for parents, if you know kids who actually LIKE this movie, do not let them date your children.#0
7581_2#I saw this movie the other day in a film school class, and I hadnt seen an Almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together dont add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all. There is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. And thats it, thats the only entertaining moment. The rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than self-indulgent trickery for a movie to be good.#0
6079_2#the tortuous emotional impact is degrading, whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all. This movie has a plot, but it is all evil from start to end. This is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie. teen killing - bad preteen sex - bad emotional battering - bad animal cruelty - bad psychological torture - bad parental neglect - bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red, blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace, what a bad mistake to make, or to watch it is UGLY#0
1156_2#Watching The Tenants has been a interesting experience for me. It is the first film I have ever seen where I have shuttled at speed through parts of the (non)action - and I can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to Serbo-Croat indie and find them fascinating. Strangely, I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; his eerie, clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable.#0
12039_4#As was to be expected, A Mazursky film made in the 70s would be counter-culture, sympathetic towards the hippies - and have a lot of hippies in it - and, naturally, it is childishly anti-authoritarian (e.g. the scene on the Mexican border, when Sutherland provokes a customs officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he (Sutherland) has long hair). The constant left-wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had I not been prepared for it beforehand; Sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film, and most of these ideas are either about blacks or Indians (needless to say, he would be welcomed with open arms in todays Hollywood). One of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in Beverly Hills - a race-war, so-to-speak, in the middle of L.A.. This is the kind of nonsense that Mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies. Fortunately, some of Sutherlands hippie friends make fun of this black-revolution premise, and the resulting dialogue isnt bad; a little later, the Jewish guy makes a crack about Sutherland making a movie about  masturbation and the black problem , when the latter starts talking about masturbation. Another funny moment is when Sutherlands older daughter performs some PC crap on stage with her white school-mates, and they all say  We, the black people of the Republic of South Africa . There is always a certain amount of self-indulgence when Hollywood makes a movie about Hollywood - especially when its Hollywood making a movie about Hollywood discussing Hollywood doing movies. Now, thats very, very self-indulgent, indeed. The scene with Fellini (playing himself) is more amusing than annoying, though. Mazursky throws in the standard flower-children and anti-Vietnam bullshit into the soup, and also pokes fun at corporate Hollywood, but he was/is just as much a part of the  phony Hollywood  (lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment) as anyone else; I am pretty sure that he, too, makes phony small-talk in Beverly Hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesnt know or like, but whose money he wants badly for his next (left-wing) project. As for his hair he has the worst hair Ive seen in a very long time (on film or elsewhere); its sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle-aged accountant would have if he grew it long. The film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness, but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third. If youd like to read my parody/biography of Donald Sutherland (and other Hollywood actors), contact me by e-mail.#0
5720_10#I saw  The Grudge  yesterday, and wow I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror-movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many surprise-scenes (whats the English word?) that made you jump in your seat. Though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think the most scary scene was on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, or when Yokos walking without her chin. The make-up is also VERY good. Sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. The boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on. The next time I hear a cracking noise I will probably feel pretty scared#1
7891_8#Now all the kids and teenagers of Springwood, Ohio are all dead expect for one teenager (Shon Greenblatt) is still alive. Freddy (Robert Englund) is letting him go and the teenager doesnt have much of a memory, when hes arriving in a new town. When a tough female psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break though the new patient. Shes finds out, where hes from. She brings him along to Springwood to spark some memories but three teens (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan), who unexpected came for the ride. Once they arrived in Springwood, the psychologist has some memory that she did lived in that town before as a child. While Freddy knows the true secret of her true identity. DVD has an strong anamorphic widescreen (1.851) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the original theatrical trailer, Jump to a Nightmare opinion and Cast & Crew information. The  Elm Street  Series Box Set, the eighth disc has interviews with the the cast & crew of this sixth film. The sixth film is also in 3-D for the film climax but you could watch it at 2-D also. This is the last of the  Elm Street  films until Wes Craven resurrected Freddy into a different, darker style in  New Nightmare  and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror film  Freddy Vs Jason . Watch for Robert Shaye (Co-Owner and Co-CEO of  New Line Cinema ), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in amusing cameos. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenters In the Mouth of Madness). From a story by the director. (    ¬Ω/     ).#1
4939_7#This movie is not great, but it is a good and enjoyable one. It feels like an indie film made out of a play script. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears the script was not written for him. And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasnt committed to yet. I mean, he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it ) Bottom line a nice little film, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and a few extras, dialogue driven, makes Morgan Freeman look good )#1
11987_7#Since it has been some years since I reviewed this classic I have decided to go back and review it more in dept, but first some insider notes from a movie critic. Now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much, to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like Talespin being released again to the TV screen instead of all the new ones, give me back my childhood cartoons, give them to the kids i have some day, give them again#1
9656_3#This movie has the made for TV stink all over it. Though, it started out with great intentions, featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes. The film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue, and rushed TV sappy melodramatic acting. The characters were so sappy that at times I thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo, and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another. The Germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch. The only thing that the German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word for this. I am a huge fan of the war genre, and this movie is crap. Nevertheless, this DVD does have an excellent extra feature, covering letters from the WWI front lines, thus making this rental not a total waste of my time.#0
9858_7#I wouldnt go so far as to not recommend this movie, since the only problems I have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems. That doesnt make it bad, just not something Id go far. And of course, visually it wont disappoint, but thats almost a given with Pixar flicks. Of all of their stuff, Id put this at the bottombut that isnt in itself bad.#1
6971_10#Of course the average  Sci-Fi  Battle Star Gallactica fan will hate this. That kind of makes me happy. I dont like those cheesy sci-fi shows especially Battle-star Gallactica and that is why I like this show. What I love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great Anime! From young teens running around shooting guns, to and extremely well balanced and complex script, to robots it reminds me of something that came from Japan except a little bit better (most Anime is too confusing).#1
4646_1#Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal, you saw in-jokes all over the place. If you know anything about porn, this mock documentary will leave you cold. Everything in it rings false. The acting here is uniformly awful, but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good. But its not.#0
7830_10#In  Die Nibelungen Siegfried , Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Kriemhild seeks revenge. She marries Hagen, and through a series of events, finally engages in a very drastic (but fitting) action at the end. One of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals. Attila the Hun (called Etzel in the movie) is shown as the strange person from the east, possibly an allusion to the Soviet Union. Obviously, it was not Fritz Langs fault that Hitler used  The Nibelungenlied  for German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what the Fuhrer liked about the story. Nonetheless, this is an absolutely formidable movie.#1
8619_1#If you want to see womens breasts, get a porno. There is no plot, but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan. The only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny, and, yes, boobs are boobs.#0
3078_1#I didnt think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts.really awful. The fact that it doesnt take itself seriously (usually a good thing) works against it, primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards. On the upshot though..the MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs.#0
749_10#This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion, its thought provoking, funny and sad with amazing performances all around!. All the characters are wonderful, and the story is just brilliant!, plus Jodie Foster and Cherie Currie are simply amazing in this!. The Ending is very powerful, however I wont spoil it for you, and I thought the character development was top notch!, plus you can really relate to all of the characters, especially Jeanie and Annie, as you will be rooting for them!, plus I loved how it moved slowly, and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about. I cant believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion, and it was funny seeing Randy Quaid in this type of role, plus this is extremely well written and made as well!. One scene that really got to me was when Madge(Marilyn Kagan), is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party, and the film has many surprising moments as well!, plus the dialog is especially excellent. This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time (In my opinion), its thought provoking, funny and sad with amazing performances all around, and i say Go see it immediately!, your bound to love it!. The Direction is fantastic!. Adrian Lyne does a fantastic job here, with awesome camera work, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Jodie Foster is really cute, and is amazing as always!, she was extremely likable, caring, had a lovable character, was intense in some scenes, was focused, and she and Cherie Currie were the heart of the film as Jeanie and Annie!(Foster Rules ). Cherie Currie is way hot, and is amazing here, i really felt sorry for her character, as she had a very likable character that just needed help, she gives a powerful performance, and created a very memorable character she was amazing!. Scott Baio is great as Brad he was really likable, and did his job well i liked him. Randy Quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him. Sally Kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot. Marilyn Kagan and Kandice Stroh are both very good as Madge and Deirdre, and did what they had to do well as the other two friends. Laura Dern has a very early role here, as it was cool to see her, not much of a part though. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall go see it immediately, its an underrated masterpiece!.       out of 5#1
10775_8#Nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation, it describes life in a small village near Correggio (hometown of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie), it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world. It reminds of Trainspotting, with a bit of Italian touch.#1
2660_10#When i first went to watch The Shining I was expecting a decent film from what I had heard about it and I liked a lot of Stanley Kubricks other work but when I started to watch it it was so much better than I thought it would be.At times I seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and I couldnt take my eyes of the screen still theres something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now some people dont like Kubricks version of The Shining since it doesnt entirely follow Stephen Kings book but in my opinion both Kubricks version,the mini-series and the book are all great.Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance.If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch The Shining.#1
4244_1#Contrary to my principles, let me first come up with a conclusion, because I have just seen this piece of  art , and still am under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary. To summarize, on the scale 1-10, I give it a pure, unadulterated 1.#0
8234_7# Fido  is to be commended for taking a tired genre, zombies, and turning it into a most original film experience. The early 50s atmosphere is stunning, the acting terrific, and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning. Suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars,  Eisenhower era  dress, art deco furniture, and zombie servants. It would be very easy to dismiss  Fido  as cartoon-like fluff, similar to  Tank Girl , but the two movies are vastly different.  Fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior. Make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed. Highly recommended. - MERK#1
11909_1#I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time Darklight. Other than that the script was predictable and the FX were awful. Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight.#0
4401_1#We went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled. It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever. It is not that i dont like cult-movies I do. But nothing happens in the film. One does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever. endless times without dialog. And the car. How do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car? It is a two seater! I have to say however the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie, so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway.  I would not recommend it, as it is a waste of your time#0
6726_3#Anyone who has seen Shine,Scott Hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist David Helfgotts; will I am sure realise that The SOLOIST is very poor in comparison.It is as slow as a lullaby( I took five breaks answering emails just to wake up). The depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent, on a par I fear with the awful beach battle depiction in Joe Wrights other disaster Attonment. .J Fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset.Downey on the other hand; although struggling with a badly paced film, still manages to charm,9Is it me or is he turning into George Clooney in more ways than one?). Comparing both these well known so called STARactors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of shines Geoeffry Rush whos brilliant performance definitely SHONE far brighter in my sky. With both Attonment and The Soloist the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject. Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD its bound to be in the bargain basement soon.#0
10103_1#This movie had me going. The title was perhaps the greatest idea that I heard. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the US and a group of lone survivors, band together, and plan to take out the zombies. DEAD WRONG! Its about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets whats coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge. As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved. Where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation. First off, the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies but mindless, debatable intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies. Sure the eating and killing is there, but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of that genre and asks the question,  why cant zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines?  I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much, its an insult and as for scary¬Önot even.#0
11879_10#This is one of my all time favorites. Not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress,  Scarface  rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.#1
12461_1#Contrary to most other comments about  Syriana  on the IMDb web-site, I and my family found watching this film on DVD at home a complete waste of time and space. This is one DVD that this family will not be sitting through again.#0
10513_7#If you have any clue about Jane Austen s production, you ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen s characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she s very good in her leading role. Also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious.#1
11580_10#As a another reviewer states Hannas War is an outstanding film about an outstanding person, Hanna  Anniko  Senesh, who would become the Jewish Joan Of Arc. Unfortunately I diverge in opinion not agreeing that Miss Detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces. Maruschka Detmers performance is brave, poignant, heartfelt or understood, and totally believable. In other words for me  In the zone.  from the opening credits. If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give Hannas War with Maruschka Detmers a try. My hat is off also to Ellen Burstyn as Hannas mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film. In that it is a team effort perhaps of two actress but not an All About Eve situation.#1
3182_1#Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then hes off to Malta where he shoots more people. He gets locked up many times for shooting people. Then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy, who is dressed like a monk. There is a boat chase, and Joe Don winds up in jail again. Finally Joe Don, with the help from Elaine from  Seinfeld  kill the bad guy, blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare. All this and a catchy theme song, just like Mitchell #0
4037_2#I have no idea what the producers of The Shield were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself The Shield is practically unwatchable. Its a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed.#0
4770_2#I wanted to like this film, yes its a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films. If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film.unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing.but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.. I will end with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!#0
1554_8#I saw this at the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with eerie protective suits. The experienced British soldiers don gas masks (only) and once again await the clouds of gas and the German attackers. The gas clouds move ever closer, finally enveloping the British defenders. The Germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb. Suddenly a scream from the defenders This gas is like no other that they have experienced before.  Now you will know why I have remembered this scene for the last 30+ years and still shiver, I think that you will too!#1

9274_8#Another fantastic film from a country, where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes, has no problems in creating passionate subject matter. Panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing, non-professional cast. While still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country, he does so without the need of a heavy storyline. It is a positive take on a country, in particular its people, that the Iranian population desperately need. The greatest pity is it wont be released domestically. The insular, paranoid Iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up amid revolution and watching the academics, artists and educated disappear over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there. The realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event. The fact he shot it on 35mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence in only using non-professional actors also really works in this film. Fine performances all round. After watching many films showing the problems Iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government. This film does the opposite. It shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isnt too far away. Some call Panahi a feminist film maker but I think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in Iran. Young, independent women.#1

9103_10#In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) such as a career, family, friendship, and love. In this way, we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small necessities. If you act in an inverse way, you will not have enough room for larger stones. The five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large  stones  in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish motion picture director defines his first feature Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel, conflicting trajectory of five women Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena, 1954-).All are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or, worst, that are in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Monica Cervera) who also stars in  20 Centimeters,   Busco,   Crimen Ferpecto,   Entre Vivir y Sonar,   Hongos,  and  Octavia.

6303_1#I had high hopes for this film. I thought the premise interesting. I stuck through it, even though I found the acting, save Helena Bonham Carter, unremarkable. I kept hoping my time spent would pay off, but in the end I was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing. Maybe in George Orwells version there is a message worth conveying. If this film accomplished anything, it has inspired me to read Orwells classic. I find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption. If the film makers message is  the mundane life is worth living , well then, theyve succeeded. I would recommend this film to no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted.#0
6098_10#This is one horror movie based TV show that gets it right. Friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies. Poltergeist the legacy Im not so sure. It may have been loosely connected to the movies. It feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it. The acting lacks but believe it or not the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie. This show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie. i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents. I watched a lot of R rated stuff as a kid, so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more movies came after the series , so it wasnt a total loss.#1
4694_10#If your a fan of Airplane type movies this is a must see! Set in the 1920s and 30s Johnny Dangerously has not only great actors but great lines.  knock down dat wall,knock down dat wall and knock down dat @$%@$ wall.   You shouldnt hang me on a hook johnny  or  Sounds like Johnnys getting laid . Its definitely a spoof of the old James Cagney Movies and references them a lot. Theres a great scene when Jhonnys walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape. Listen closely to the fake priests readings, its pretty funny. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Watch his reaction to Johnny after he tips the Pope, a lot said without making a sound.I recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs.#1
11098_1#Like most people I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film, especially the  film makers were then attacked  aspect that the case seems to emphasize, what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob. Avoid like the plague.#0
4448_4#What a powerful start to a film when Julia Roberts character is punched in the face by her abusive and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as Farrah Fawcetts The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was mis-lead. This film was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for, and felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with Roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in Iowa. Her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia getting a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity.there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film I did not care all that much. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re-arranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen. This was I assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience. But I did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as I have said cheated the audience. If it had stayed the course I might have felt for her and her situation. Of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol Ms Roberts. If only the real world was anything close to this.See the Burning Bed and you understand what a film is suppose to be like on the subject of domestic abuse.#0
4219_4#This is an amateur movie shot on video, not an  electrifying drama  as the DVD liner notes falsely boast. I have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. The bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could have been made using a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. The editing is extremely rough. The final edit was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, instead of with a proper editor. Perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English, e.g.,  Where you go now?  To say the production quality is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If youre not scared away yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.#0
5853_3#THE IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. It certainly didnt kill me during its hour and a half duration, but it didnt impress me much either. A group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants (in a scene featuring cinemas least convincing head crushing sound effect) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant an old persons brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the producers heads. But the production literally doesnt have the guts to pull it off. Ive never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror film, that they dont pack it to the edge of the frame with gore. The acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as the assistant Dr. Price. He has a nice evil laugh. The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks.#0
7590_3#Gorgeous bodies, gorgeous colors and camera work, pretentious dialog, banal plot. The name of the prima donna, Camilla, and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently, are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from Dumas novel La Dame aux Camelias, the movie Camille starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least Verdis opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not-too-virtuous young ladies, social outcasts for one reason or another, loved, split up, reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene One forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera, but why waste Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful rendition of LA in the 30s, a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman, and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isnt even any beautiful singing?#0
5415_1#Dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The movie followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti all of whom were superb. In short, the movie is worth a miss.#0
2694_3#warningIt contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene then its a bad movie. (see for example 300). This one confirms the above lemma. The second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Even more, other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. And this made more frustrated. To compensate the consequent lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters. And oh yes, they have lots to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more?, he is cheating his wife, more?, he plans to rob his father, more?, his wife is cheating with his brother, more?, he doesnt regret his complicity to his mothers death, more?, he is a serial killer, more? etc etc its not enough space to write here I wonder how could he have a top job. And why his wife didnt leave him before. On the other hand I enjoy much the performances of the actor Hoffman. Also its a lot of sentimentality, for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parentslives before the crime.#0
609_1#This was an absolutely terrible movie. Dont be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem this movies ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actors like Christopher Walkens good name. I could barely sit through it.#0
8204_8#Sudden Impact was overall better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was building up to be a great movie, but then I saw the villain(s) and was disappointed. 8/10.#1
3383_8#Especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed (1973), this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong. Too many people, and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. Its set in New York in 2022 (I think), and it reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta. Gritty, pre-Star Wars dystopian science fiction.#1
6306_2#Working at a video store I get to see quite a few movies and on occasion I try to watch some of the not so big movies. Proud happened to be one of them. The initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during WWII had some merit. However in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in WWII. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. This primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie. I commend the men that served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured. A movie should have been made focusing on the accomplishments these men did for themselves, the Navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is racism during WWII.#0
6629_1#If you have seen the Sholay of 1975, Dont watch this movie. If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975, Go WATCH IT. But do not watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of Sholay.  If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. )#0
7772_2#This is one lowly film. It has no real plot. We never are made privy to motivations, other than wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then its being controlled by these three older people. Why are they doing what they are doing; in order to strike fear into other members of the group? I dont know. There is some mist from a fog machine that rolls around in the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it. Does it do something? I dont know. Theres some nudity for its own sake. Im always surprised to see this in films this old. Things have actually settled down in this regard these days. Anyway, the people run around like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plan; no resources; no nothing. There are about five silly climaxes in the film. Who are these people and  is  there a ghost or demon. What happened to the other people? I challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence. What a mess.#0
8301_7#Gary Busey is the title character, Frank  Bulletproof  McBain, your standard-issue reckless maverick cop whos earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes (38 and counting), he never stops going after the bad guys. 7/10#1
6362_7#Granted I had seen some  Speed Racer , but I never really watched it and I had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the Phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five. This one though I watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it. It actually ended, the bad guys done in unlike nearly every American cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one Transformers that ended with Galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids never making it home, with GI Joe with Cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth. This one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. As it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one Android 16 used against Cell in Dragonball Z, then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out. Then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. He would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called Bobo in America. The villains not only consisted of Dr. Hell, but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head. Interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion.#1
9057_3# What an absolutely crappy film this is. How or why this movie was made and what the hell Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me. Strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick DO NOT waste your time on this film.#0
10027_1#The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is hilarious. Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I cannot see anything positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write. The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan. I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero.#0
3616_2#If you merely look at the cover of this movie, its cool. DONT. The movie itself put me to sleep. It was slow paced, had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense. The acting was bottom feeder material and the plot, while it wouldve been cool for a different movie, was poorly shown here. They even kill the only likeable character in the whole film! I give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end. Other than that, you might want to save yourself from this movie trash.#0
9852_7#No day passes without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects. After watching Ice Age I felt thats it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre. Overall its a nice movie, but its rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche. If you dont hate cute animals making funny things, watch it at least once.#1
4028_10#I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here. Im relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the US. So I dont have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films. Luckily, no comparison is needed. If you only see one Bollywood film in your life, make it Pinjar.#1
11039_8#Now this is what Id call a good horror. With occult/supernatural undertones, this nice low-budget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene. This proves you dont need wild FX or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie. I thought his was a very good movie, 8/10#1
1781_4#Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest. Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.#0
3859_4#Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie just fails to make a connect.  There are some laughs to be sure and the cast (even if miscast) do their best with sub grade material which doesnt transcend its raunchy topic. So instead of getting a successful raunch fest (ie Animal House or American Pie) we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or something).#0
8159_1#This is only related to the first movie by the name. The plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks  I have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad. Avoid this at all costs, the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick and so is the fourth but this one and the 3rd are rubbish #0
5219_3# Metamorphosis  hold a tiny bit of cult-value, simply because it was written and directed by George Eastman. This Italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid Joe DAmato production during the late 70s/early 80s. Wouldnt it be interesting for avid Euro-cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare-butted in  Erotic Nights of the Living Dead  all the time? I thought so! Now, unlike the movies he starred in, Eastmans own  Metamorphosis  is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments. There are a handful of nasty murders, cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies (a guest appearance by sleaze-queen Laura Gemser!) on display, but its mainly a talkative movie. The handsome & eloquent Dr. Houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human DNA codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. He developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process, but if he doesnt come up with detailed reports any time soon, his research will be stopped. So Dr. Houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. Needless to say (and like the title implies), he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! In other words, his research sucked! Like the other reviewers already mentioned, this movie  borrows  a lot of ideas from David Cronenbergs  The Fly  ¬ñ the dramatic romance sub plot included - but doesnt add any originality from its own. The big difference is that you constantly feel connected with Jeff Goldblums character in  The Fly , whereas Dr. Houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible. The rapid-ageing-syndrome aspect also reminded me of Ruggero Deodatos sadly underrated giallo  Phantom of Death , only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didnt inflict it on himself. The physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films, though. Few scares or excitement to discover here, instead the movie features loads of bad acting, poor lighting, lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot. Feel free to skip this one.#0
4090_8#This movie is simply incredible! I had expected something quite different form the film that I actually saw. However, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior. Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual, for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-brow sort of pornography. It even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape. Go see it! It s worth your money and time #1
7374_10#For his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. In the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. The ending is superb. The makers of Blaire Witch obviously watched this film its ending wasnt an end but a beginning of the end. A great movie and only a piece of Japans great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind.#1
11446_2#My family and I screened Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog is ( my four year old loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this movie, was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg in the face for making this movie. I will admit however, that the soundtrack was good. I wasnt sure if the movie was set in the 80s, but with the majority of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station. Or if you are dead set on watching this, people under the influence might enjoy it.#0
12422_1#I rented this film to see what might be a bloody, non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks, he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard, I swear! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back. There is no good fight scenes at all, the punches are two inches away from a person. Characters personalities change in matter of seconds. One guy is a bad and in the next scene hes good. The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick. I hated this film.#0
4829_8#The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. On the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront, director Jean-Marc Vall√©e who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victorias story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. Its a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet thats partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare. - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http www.invocus.net)#1
2428_8#As an old white housewife I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors. anyone who appreciates his work like in Deep Cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor. Since I think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting. All of the acting is quite good. If you cant take lower Manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorified action shoot-em ups) then this is not a film you would enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburnes usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go at each other some day in a movie.#1
3701_2#I was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham. Bad dialogue, worse (worst) acting, lifeless all the way, and the cast knew it. The two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life, sparkle, and were captivating.#0
7813_1#In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of Hollywood ego, only beaten by the new king kong movie. Superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman Ive ever seen, from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat. He looks just silly wearing the costume. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane, she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, He is actually supermans son, who would have ever thought.) and the acting was horrible. This movie has one good thing going for it, and its name is Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie. What this movie needed was the cast of  lois and clark  (except Kevin Spacey of course) and a different story. I watched this movie after watching  the hills have eyes  and I was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that.#0
7203_9#This film has very tight and well planned dialogue, acting and choreography. Question Does anyone know where the house is actually located? It is one of the most interesting houses, a 19thC windmill.#1
7671_1#The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. It gives the basic summary of what is going on. This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but know people who have. From my understanding whether youve played the game or not this movie does not get any better. Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.#0
6823_1#I should have trusted my instincts better No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, youll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was Philip Glasss soundtrack. I couldnt - and still cant - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a big waste of time! My advice Forget commercialism! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again instead!#0
11149_10#Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides hes going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City. The women are there for the asking and the men are mainly  tutti-fruttis.  Wide-eyed, he comes to New York City, not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences, one worse than the other. In the middle of that chaos, he meets and befriends Rico  Ratso  Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building. A dark story of dashed hopes, John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s, and at the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life. There is the implied notion that they may have been lovers -- Ratsos reaching out to hug Joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this -- but this is essentially a buddy film, one that manages to survive, literally, to the death, and bring some form of hope to Joe who at the end in Florida seems much changed, older, wiser.#1
10562_9#Such energy and vitality. You just cant go wrong with Busby Berkley films and this certainly must be his best. Of course the choreography is wonderful, but also the banter between Cagney and Blondell is so colorful and such a delight. Dont miss this one.#1
6828_10#Broadway and film actor-turned-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemarys Baby)creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there is a cameo by Peter Falk. The premise of the film An aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands)re-evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. It has a 60s cinematic look and it even reminded me of Polanskis Rosemarys Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are the ones every successful actress has- she is getting old and she will become useless in her career. Furthermore, she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity and merit. She has lived only for her career- she has no children, doesnt do charitable deeds, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She is falling apart. Shes in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the characters tormented psyche and acts the part quite well. She is a terrific actress and this 70s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. Its a movie with lots of deep-seated emotion but has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70s generation. Either that or this movie is a product of the 70s which was itself cynical in many aspects- Nixons deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values are not great, and this film is not well-known, its a very haunting film with haunting moods. Kudos to the underrated and late director Cassavetes who died in the late 80s.#1
3733_1#Weak,stale, tired, cliched; wants to be Basic Instinct, but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives, new insights. Insipid, trite, grotesque, and without the possibly-redeeming value of brevity; oh, waitit was only 90 minutes longit must have just  seemed  a lot longer! Id rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again. Im expressing an opinion here I guess this means I didnt like it.#0
7483_2#One would think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese, a movie should be, at the very least, decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time. I tried to enjoy this---I really did. But The Out-of-Towners ultimately fails miserably. If you really want time-efficient entertainment, just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet. Just please dont watch this movie.#0
151_1#This is really terrible. I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable.#0
1040_1#I cant believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long, long time. Bad film-making is not  different , its just bad film-making.#0
9563_3#This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80s hit . Its set in the modern day as we see a base in Afghanistan get destroyed by a UAV right at the start. If you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. This is an awful movie and is best avoided.#0
10996_1#The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies Ive ever seen. I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase  guaranteed to offend  written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh.

10025_1#If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj) then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards. Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out. As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers. People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively. I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie, the actors and the production house both.#0
2948_10#It should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like it. Murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes about dicks, pussy, tits and insaults so many famous people including his own  family . Among the people who gets it by murphy are Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life. I mean, when a person doesnt know who Mr. T is, but still laughs so hard of Murphy as Mr. T, theres something about it. At the time I saw the show I couldnt remember who Mr T. was but still laughed. Now I know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny. Because thats what Eddie do - he can make those impressions so good that it dont matter who the hell hes trying to do, its still hilarious. And on top of that, we learn that Murphy actually is a very good singer. Please watch it..#1
8082_3#It was one of those late night  Its there  I saw it things. Sometimes they are great. This one was awful, but it really shouldnt have been. I have seen the same cast members be incredibly good. I have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets. All the difference is in the writing.#0
606_10#I have seen a lot of Saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music, dance, drama and great cinema in his movies. Ib√©ria shows an even better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that called my attention is the fact that, in this movie, dancers and musicians, dance and music, are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation, examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing. The interest of Saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works. Thats why I recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.#1
7054_2#This movie was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldnt even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris. It was pretty hilarious. The songs  Sini Ne  and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, it seems Emran doesnt have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time.#0
1141_10#Anyone who doesnt laugh all through this movie has been embalmed. I have watched it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise. Fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children. Im biased, Im in love with her. This movie should have won Oscars for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Get the DVD so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years. You will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out.#1
9191_1#Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze. Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. Its unbelievably bad. Just to let you in on how bad it is, Ill offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see corn filled crap like this? There is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. Im really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, Im dumbstruck. Its so bad I cant even find the words. RATING ZERO out of      .#0
765_9#I guess when  Beat Street  made a national appearance,  Flashdance  came at the same time. The problem with  Flashdance  is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why  Beat Street  was better. The only movie that could rival  Beat Street  seems to be  Footloose , because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings. By the way, during the dance scene called Tango, Tango, I guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making a cameo appearance.#1
3545_7#Big splashy film of the Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him IF he gives up craps. He decides on one last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), who bets big, is in town. He bets Sky that he cant get mission worker Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. That may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie! Its worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while. I give it a 7.#1
8483_1#I normally only write reviews for movies I really hated or really liked. And, as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there, I didnt like it. By now, I assume you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie, so Ill skip the summary. Lets break this down, pros and cons Pros The Naidu Character Possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy.#0
4175_8#I always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them Well, in time I wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia. Or did that  feeling  decide to pack its bags and say  goodbye  somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history, and then never came back? Or did it? Because for me, it came back the first time I saw  Ekspres, Ekspres . And it was its old self again. Treat yourself. Watch it.#1
12244_1#This film is awful. The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI. The crocodile looks like a large gray smudge. The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive. It is mostly a photo-shopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed, and I have seen lots of the very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. Aside from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is composed of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as Waiters/Waitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building (and crushing Kate) the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water. No laws of Physics can apply to this movie or the special effects. At least there is honor among crocodiles.#0
11435_3#I wish Id known more about this movie when I rented it. Id put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt contrived, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple I dont care how big a part of the story line that is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. And Charlie, for a zoologist, she certainly doesnt seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made Gray fall for her? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion), the cabbie in drag, and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were such great dancers, I wish wed seen more of that, as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie). Could have been better.#0
4583_1#If you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch  Waking Life,  which is brilliant.  What the $ ! Do We Know  is all over the place in its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acted, utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying. It wasnt thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. The inclusion of that rambling freak  Ramtha  in this film is reason enough to avoid it. Isnt it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old Atlantian god or something? What a flake that old chick is, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. The people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.#0
10974_2#Im Irish and Ive been living in Denmark for a while so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see Intermission. And I will go on record as saying Im expecting a backlash from these comments because most people I have spoken to have said it was great. But before you reply, ask yourself Would think so highly of this movie if it was set in England or America?#0

9592_4#Ive seen the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I hoped to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The  princess  is not very talkative, as you may have noticed She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who only stared to make his point, then beat the crap out of the opponents. During the entire movie, I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked, why was she fighting, who did she love and trust. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialog. Dont watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds! Its so bad, that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour. Approximately. I give a 4/10.#0
6534_10#I had heard this movie was good from a lot of my friends that saw it, and they all said it was amazing, so I had very high expectations- and Nancy Drew exceeded those high expectations! It had funny parts, it kept me entertained with the action and all the dudes trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing as Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was very good, also. I would definitely recommend this movie   ~Nancy Drew#1
4360_10#In this grim melodrama, Barbara Stanwyck plays the eldest of three wealthy sisters who become orphans when their father dies in France. Threatened with the danger of losing the opulent family home, Big Sister makes a grand sacrifice and secretly marries a real estate developer so she can inherit her aunts fortune. A few years later, she learns that he is after the family estate and wants to tear it down so she leaves him and tries to stop him. More time passes and the husband ends up taking her to court when he learns that she has borne him a son without telling him. The part of  Gig Young  was played by actor Byron Barr who later assumed the name before he became famous. Anyone interested in purchasing a copy let me know by writing to me at iamaseal2@yahoo.com#1
5942_7#I really liked BATMAN DEAD END, I thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance Collora could make a fine film. This trailer didnt quite give me the same impression. The story line, or potential story line, was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good TV movie or television show. All in all it was a good trailer. Id probably pay to see a film, if ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television. The story line, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous of Loiss attraction to Wayne, Lex and Twoface teaming to beat Superman and the joining of forces between Batman & Superman is a good one. Im sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film Collora and company, even OHearn could deliver a decent film. Certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of Hollywood lately.#1
5651_1#In my life I have seen many great and awful movies. I am not an expert in professional reviews, but I have definitely something to say about this one. Firstly, these actors are the worst I have seen Their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think that these actors were not interested in the quality.  Please, if my message reaches you - save your time and money.#0
2928_2#Id really, really wanted to see this movie, and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it showed up in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. Good acting, like I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing.#0
732_7#Well, I have finally caught up with  Rock N Roll High School,  almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summers new documentary  Patti Smith Dream of Life  sometime around 2040!) And no, the film doesnt feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, adorably played by P.J. Soles, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book  Cult Movies,  quite accurately describes Mary Woronovs performance as an  evil Eve Arden. ) A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some truly rousing tunes. Riff is, of course, the 1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a bakers dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total blast. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing to  Teenage Lobotomy  at this blowout may be the pictures funniest moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing  I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,  is quite exhilarating. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kids wet dream. Fun stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder.#1
9522_1#Wow! I remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s. They usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students. As I watched this film I felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s. However, then I find out that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools. Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise $200,000. So the seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you raise $200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in? And why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out? Andahh forget it, this film was stupid and made in 1989!?#0
4306_10#The mere fact that I still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film. To me this substantiates Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another. I truly believe that before the movie Crash there was Grand Canyon. The major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release. Im not going to argue which one is better, but I will contend to the idea that they share the same message. Id love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject. I will start a commentary which you can find at http www.myspace.com/62229249. You may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share, because i have a true love for film.#1
2547_1#I havent seen it in over twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the kidnapper. There are better movies from the seventies like this to check out.#0
10664_8#Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film? I LOVE it! One of my Top 10 films of all time. It just makes me feel good. I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over  Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is THE babe of the film, IMHO! I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film. The two are like apples and oranges. The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe its only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen arent changed more than they are. This is a very good film, it is very satisfying. Thats all you need to know!#1
4313_9#Grand Canyon falls under a very scarce category it is a very clever film, with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end. I have the impression that it never made it to its deserved ranking (and never will), because of its simplicity. This kind of flick needs sensitive watchers. Pity thought that IMDb makes me write ten lines, because this is in no way necessary in this particular case. Anyway in order to fulfill this request, I will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting not that it is bad but it could have been done much better. Exception made for Kevin Kline who was perfect. Go ahead and watch it.#1
960_7#This is a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand. Even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort, but that just got wasted on me. Bottom line nice visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap.#1
1197_10#I just watched this movie, by mistake. What a little gem. This film made in 1956 looks, and feels, like a late Seventies movie. And is in fact better, more restrained and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. The environmental, anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time. The understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic. Much more than Dances with Wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo  killing fields  of the late 1800s. Probably because those in the movie were real killing fields. The movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls, so the animals you see are really being shot, the bones are real. In conclusion, a very under-rated western masterpiece, superbly acted, directed and shot.#1
11457_4#OK. I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this film ran pretty low. Unless youve got some wierd Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess, Rob Lowe) fetish, theres really no reason to see this one.#0
753_8#Story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most level-headed of the bunch--but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks shes more mature than the rest of them. A very good movie--essential viewing if you came of age in 1980. The film has a deserved R rating (plenty of drug use and swearing) but should be seen by all teens. I give it a 8.#1
11778_10#This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. It brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the authors subsequent opus,  Collapse . Diamond himself comes off as personable and caring, not just a disinterested or disengaged academic. This series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to  publish or perish,  as the saying goes about academe, but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects,  Why you white people got so much cargo, and we have so little?  Because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, Diamond looked for an answer that didnt insult that intelligence or that community. I like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as  South Parks   Blame Canada   Blame wheat!  #1
440_10#My all-time favorite movie. Oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. It is Josie Lawrences best work by far, and transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright. Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I can find no fault in it. The music, by famed composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel.#1
3054_1#The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people. (as MST3k Commentary states it Sanata has the dirt on every! Santas Tentacles reach far and wide! There is no hiding from the Klaus Organization ) I give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.#0
2347_10#I have been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the very beginning. It is wonderfully thought up, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show. With a magnificent cast, wonderful script, and hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is, by-far, one of the most remarkable shows on your television.#1
3293_10#If ever I was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years, then it would have to be  Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo  for its meaning, the way it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the lyrics by Kaif Bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars. The other would have to be  Chalte Chalte.  Pakeezah was Meena Kumaris last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen. In each of the the songs that are picturised, she looks young but after that she does not. But one actor who didnt change in his looks was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her and especially her feet, after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them, he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are. Kamal Amrohis grandson has now started to revive his grand fathers studio by making a comedy movie.#1
12006_4#OK the director remakes LOVE ACTUALLY The director Nikhil Advani after debuting with KHNH does his second half and wait Salman Khan doesnt act only, just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god Priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her, she does get better towards the end Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is okay Shannon is okay#0
8685_3#Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun (but rehashed and overdone) Bush jokes. Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even more. Do yourself a favor, skip  Lil Bush  and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy  Thats My Bush . Youll thank me.#0
7895_10#In the opening scenes of this movie a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another mans bathroom and blew out all the lights. This must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film, Robin Hood did not make an appearance as far as I could see. However, Bette Davis(Daisey Appleby), The Whales of August ,87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so called swim suit on her yacht with George Brent(Johnny Jones), The Spiral Staircase ,46. Daisey even proposed marriage to Johnny in a Ferris Wheel upside down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a great couple, one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter. Off stage, Davis and Brent were having a real torrid love affair, which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the film for you #1
3017_7#Philo Vance had many affinities with Bulldog Drummond¬Ö He was a gentleman with the kind of polish and elegance only usually associated with the British upper classes and he was also independently wealthy¬Ö William Powells elegance and suavity made him the perfect Vance and although a year later he switched studios, he stayed in the same genre with the enormously successful and popular  The Thin Man  at MGM¬Ö#1
6197_1#At the end of the film I just asked myself  is it the worse movie I have ever seen or is it the worse movie I have ever seen ? . And the answer is Actually, after having seen this movie and thought a bit about the meaning of it, you just cant find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes, which are unbelievably brutal and useless. It seems to me as if the director tried to push this question into the crowds head   what are such crimes compared to horror of war and extermination ?  because i noticed that the two awful scenes where directly connected to war and its horrors (during the first scene you can here the girl that is being raped screaming and in the same time you hear one of president Bushs speeches about the necessity of starting a war with Iraq and in the second scene, the pictures of the three criminals sticking a sword in a womans vagina, are directly followed by archive pictures of World war II. But as a matter of facts, i really could not think about the relative gravity of theses two different kinds of human horrors expression, being done i was too shocked by what i had just seen and felt. (sorry for bad English)#0
12217_10#I went to see Ashura as 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, that was one cool kick off. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but due to health reasons, hes still in Japanoh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies. As far as cinematography goes, the esthetics are pretty interesting. Its by far, the movie that looks the most like a manga. Its creamed full of special effects and nothing, at all cost will prevent this movie to look realisticits pretty amazing. Lots of colours an  unreal  photography, other than thatits pretty straightforwardbut like I said, the main character is carrying the movie A must see, a tale lead by masterful hands#1
1357_4# may contain a spoiler of sorts?  The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some geeks panties in a bunch. His landmark appearance in Back to the Future as George McFly has sealed him into the American conscience forever. More recently, he has been trying to get back into the culty subconscious with Bartleby and Willard. rating C#0
1294_7#Unremittingly bleak and depressing, the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised Houellebecqs controversial novel of the same name. Like many French films, its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow - or should that be, slowly painful? While this is an excellent and challenging film, it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the right mood to see it.#1
7081_8#The story of this film is truly remarkable. A virus cut loose and only 1% of the human race survived. The only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say,  The Twelve Monkeys did it.  Thats right, the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 Billion people. Apparently animals do not contract this disease. Day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it. All they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them, the deaths began during 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (Or at least thats what the poster says.) So a current convict named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent as a  volunteer  to get some samples from above. After he does his  volunteer  work, he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world. Cole accepts and the story of the Twelve Monkeys begin. For the whole acting of the film, I give it a A+. Bruce Willis is great for this role and he acts good, but Brad Pitt is completely 100% excellent. His acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. I never really cared for Brad Pitt in till I saw him in this and Fight Club. There characters or similar in this film, he is just a little more insane in this film. So overall I think this film is completely worth checking out. For most people its a great science fiction film, I just dont think it is a masterpiece.#1
2619_8#If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King 3 Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead. Just like Tom Stoppards beguiling film, we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original Timon, the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a hat, and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence issues. By following their story - rather than Simbas - we get to see why all the animals bowed down as Simba was presented from Pride Rock. We find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to oust Scar. And we find out how they dealt with the hyenas once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but he is ably supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg reprising their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters Timons mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device which doesnt always help to progress the story. Having said that, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. With more laughs than any other third-in-a-Disney-series movie, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable.#1
309_1#Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandlers film career but was digitized after a short time. Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and failsor so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leones favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard aint Dooley squat! End of file.#0
8357_10#A wonderful, free flowing, often lyrical film that whisks you along, ever smiling, even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way. One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well. This is possibly Depardieus best performance, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age. Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play. Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant/romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect.#1
9340_4#What a wasted cast. I cannot express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie, and hope I can forewarn you of the same disappointment.#0
9857_1#I just finished watching this movie and I found it was basically just not funny at all. Id suggest not bothering with this movie unless youre a huge DnD fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it.#0
12404_9#I was living Rawlins when this movie was made and I got lucky enough to be able to work on it. Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see all the behind the scene workings, from the Barbedwire coming alive to the Electric chair up through the wardens office floor. Also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called  Disney Gate  by locals. If anybody is interested and is ever in Rawlins, most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour. It was a lot of fun working for and with R. Harlin and wished I had a chance to do it again.#1
10476_9#My first exposure to  Whale Music  was the Rheostatics album of the same name, that I bought around 1993. I was reading the liner notes and the band said the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by Canadian author Paul Quarringtons book. Maury Chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius. The movie deals with family relationships, love, and finding someone who understands. I would strongly recommend  Whale Music  to not only music fans, but anyone who has ever lost something or someone, and tried to find their way back to the world.#1
9947_1#This movie was horrible. I swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell.  SPOILERS Phht more like reasons not to watch it  They sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he coulda been long gone. The ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs. And when ICE-T is on that Hill and uses that Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN like its a sniper rifle (and then cuts down a tree with eight shells?? It would take 1000s of shells to cut down a tree that size.) Shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light?? I didnt see a scope on that thing. Also when he got shot in the gut and kept going, that was retarded he would of bled to death right there. PlusThe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel. It wouldnt blow up and kill him. The bullet would still fire kill Ice T but mess up the barrel.#0
8345_3#This movie could have been so much better, especially considering the talent. Larenz Tates portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. He doesnt lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are Larenz Tate, when he should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has Hollywood written all over it. The powers that be obviously pushed it, but it only made the characters more unrealistic. The positives of the movie were Miguel Nunezs portrayal of Little Richard, and the cameo of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. Its too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this film was a wasted opportunity.#0
1835_10#What a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe. i dont know how come the rating of the movie is 7.3 it should be 9.3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by Akshay is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect. you should watch this movie once, i think twice well its up to u. Anyways i love this movie and its not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one of the best movie in the bollywood history. but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya. the only thing i dont like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if A R Rahman would be the music director but anyways we cant do anything about that so ya.#1
2032_2#I gave this two stars for the awesome DV shot clarity, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was being generous, I know. Thank you.#0
9512_8#This is a film that can make you want to see it again. I especially, liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming, but when Laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back again. Eight Stars for this one. Although it was released in 2002, I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.#1
3453_3#It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source. Pretentious.#0
11753_1#tries to be funny and fails miserably. The animation is just terrible, looks like a 2 year old threw it together in his sleep. Plot is dull and cliched. IF you have a young child, maybe rent it. but dont waste hard earned money to pay to see it. 1/10#0
11675_10#I always follow the Dakar, so when my husband bought Charlies Race to Dakar DVD home I couldnt wait to watch it! Of course wed seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on, but that never gives the background and specific teams. In conclusion, to Simon Pavey - you sir are a hero, I was so impressed by the your quiet achiever manner and the fact that you actually finished..just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is. And to Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - full marks for pulling it off. To think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable. Youre all wonderful.#1
9921_3#Strummers hippie past was a revelation, but overall this felt like crashing a wake. Campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire. There were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage. I love The Clash and Joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now (FU Mick Jones), but this doc left me wanting..to relate more. Using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent. They should have been interviewed on their own. Even using Strummers radio DJ voice did little to glue the film together. And can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes? After the awesome  Filth And The Fury  I hoped Temple could deliver. A Joe Strummer doc deserves better.#0
10409_2#As if the storyline wasnt depressing enough, this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher. Weird stuff. Then theres the core premise of the hero/heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a hes besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what sort of traumatic childhood did he have? Just that he didnt get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly. He tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did, but its really really so hard to empathize. Such sad and unusual self destruction. Was it supposed to be funny? What was it all about really?#0
7684_7#Reading all of the comments Are very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasnt gotten any credit in this sight yet. So if you dont mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist I would also like to tell him  job well done . I know this Sight is for the GOOD TIMES cast but, wouldnt you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all. I would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his work displayed in my home.#1
4511_9#I just picked up the DVD release of this movie while on holiday in Norway where it has been released with English subtitles. The films only weak point is the rather clich√©d Flower Power teacher who uses every friendly teacher trick in the book. Other than this I feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy.#1
162_8#For a  no budget  movie this thing rocks. I dont know if Americas gonna like it, but we were laughing all the way through. Some really Funny Funny stuff. Really non-Hollywood. Ive seen some of the actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them I think Ive seen in commercials or in something somewhere. Basically it Rocked! Luckily I got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors.#1
12126_2#Here again is yet another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role she knows how to play? This time its set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man. I am so not surprised because that is so very predictable. Then her husband gets mad and throws the milk. I wouldnt be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well. I wouldnt be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie. Then after some milk throwing, she says sorry and sees the blouse man again. Duh. Then while she is making it with him, her son gets stung by wasps. My mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest. This kids mom didnt have time to tell him that, she was too busy with the blouse man.#0
4303_1#Previous comment made me write this. It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist.Look,race is nothing.Im color blind.I look like Pierce Brosnan but Im no Irish. So what?I might add that I am not 100% Serb,that I have some Austrian and Croat blood within me but whats the point.Im dark, half-breed?Is that so? Anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like Lantos(producer9and director is racist for me.Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. Hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back. I am proud of being Serb and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians,Croats,Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes I am from Serbia and I have multiethnical family).This movie doesnt show sufferings of Serbs or Croats within Sarayevo,terrible terrorism of street gangs,Muslim extremism.I add I kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers Muslim,catholic or orthodox, killed in this war.This film is manipulation with our misery,false humanitarianisms which doesnt help at all.It helps Lantos to fill his pockets with more doe,alright!#0
1783_2#There are no spoilers here Because there is no plot to spoil. Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting-- no talent required. The only bright spot are a few really good one-liners delivered very nicely by Alice Krige, but then again, she IS Alice Krige. Her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be. She is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot. How they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery. The screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script. It has major continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, horror formula writing, and simply falls short of making any sense what-so-ever. The creatures, while they have neat skills like going  dim , the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored.  Dont waste any time on this one.#0
75_1#Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called `facts in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious. This is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to TV. There isnt even one good word I can say about this film. Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here. When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!#0
11414_9#A great storyline with a message. Joan Plowright is superb as  Phoebe , Mike Kopsa is hilarious as  coach  and Richard de Klerk plays the role of  Carmine  superbly. Mischa Barton as  Frankie  puts in a good performance and Ingrid as  Hazel  plays her first lead extremely well. This film is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The editing is first rate.#1
12171_3#Being a slasher film aficionado, I typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I will say. While channel surfing the other night, Sleepaway Camp II happened to cross paths with me. Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but have never actually seen any of them (for shame, I know). I will note that since I have not seen the original, my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchises own design. Ultimately, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really did want to sleep away the camp. The deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them. If youre looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel surfing takes you across this one, check and see what else is on.#0
1549_2#While Leon is cute on SNL, hes only on for a minute. Like most SNL skits-to-movies, this one cant fill 90 minutes. It has some cute moments (the ones youve seen in the trailer) but the actors are largely wasted. Tim Meadows does his best but the plot just doesnt have many high points. Will Farrell has a bit part. Farrell may be the funniest man alive but not in this movie. What a shame.#0

4115_8#This is one of the weirder movies I have recently watched. Thats because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film. Kurasawas experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences. Not every episode is depressing and harsh, but overall this is definitely the tone. Lets see,we have a case of incest/rape, attempted murder, wife swapping, alcoholism, infidelity, death of a little boy after eating tainted fish, a man with severe depression (he never talks during the movie and looks very scary), a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments  driving  his street car through paths among the garbage piles, a man married to a total shrew (I think I liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist!), etc., etc. In fact, it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an Ingmar Bergman movie set in Japan, as Bergman made MANY movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life. Is it any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself?! So, did I like it? No. It was not a fun experience. But, it was a very well-made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was sort of like watching a train wreck--you dont WANT to see all the carnage but you cant help but watch! Of all the vignettes, I think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didnt really seem to fit in (he was too well-adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump) was perhaps meant to represent Kurasawa himself. Maybe. I dunno. If youve seen a variety of Kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films, give this one a watch. However, do NOT make this your first experience watching his movies--its sure to scare away many viewers #1
8734_1#Maybe Ive seen one too many crime flick, or maybe I dont take the right drugs. Its a bad rip off of  M  the classic Fritz Lang film starring Peter Lorre. Youd be SO much better off renting that instead.#0
3096_10#Six degrees had me hooked. I looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replaced its time spot. I thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised it ended. We could relate to the characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters. There wasnt anybody on the show I didnt like and felt the acting was superb. I alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas. I for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give it a good time slot, dont keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on.#1
2073_7#In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous speed trap town. Much revenue was generated by the Sheriffs Department catching speeders. The ones who tried to outrun the Sheriff? Well, that gave the Sheriff a chance to push them off the Clarksberg Curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, in the beginning of the movie, a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths, if I recall correctly. Then one day, a stranger drove into town. Possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a car name, as in McCord gaskets. In possibly the ultimate hot rod. A black flamed 34 Ford coupe. The colors of death, evil and hellfire. He gets picked up for speeding by the Sheriff on purpose. He checks out the lay of the land. He is the brother of one of the Sheriffs victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is all in favor of the Sheriff. Theres only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so  this aint a-ever gonna happen again to anyone  recreate the chase and settle the contest hot-rodder style to the death. He goes out to the Curve and practices. The Sheriff knows McCord knows. The race begins This is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road.#1
10540_10#I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination on display, the visual interpretation of the script, the humor is constantly surprising. The two leads are great and really carry the film. My advice would be to not even watch a trailer, just rent the film and watch without expectations. I rented from blockbuster, so it is readily available in brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and thats always good, unless its just that was stupid. I loved this film, you just dont get to see gems like this every day. This should become a cult favorite. Give it a try, you may just feel the same way about it as i do.#1
6751_8#Pretty good film from Preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live. In this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. #1
12081_8#Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail-biter. She accepts a position as secretary to a London society dowager (played imperiously by Dame May Witty) and her creepy son (the effete and bothersome George Macready). Before she knows it, she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor shes never seen before, where Witty and Macready are calling her Marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that shes Macreadys mad wife. Of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds, and even though we know Julia has to eventually escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how shell manage it. Grade B+#1
2245_7#Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal doesnt even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that Salva capitalizes on. The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.#1
11106_10#The Sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed TV series ever, so naturally my expectations were through the roof, and yet the show surpassed them. I love the mafia and crime genre in film and I enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds, but this is so much more. 86+ hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia/action stories, but also to be a great family drama, a shocking character study, a laugh-out-loud comedy, a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil, and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one. David Chases epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more, and cements HBO as the closest TV can get to cinematic perfection, paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away. Whether you love or hate the ending, or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself. The iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history. There are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show, so if youre thinking of watching something else instead, do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit.#1
10713_9#An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as the Highland clearances, feature in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them. Its all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and its a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken. Im English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful. The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words, you are watching the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should go and see this film.#1
11714_1#The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub! This has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of  real  UK police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery. Avoid it like the veritable plague.#0
6261_2#A couple move into their dream home, unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery. The film is said to have been based on a true story, although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed. The plot is hardly unique - see Spielbergs Poltergeist (1982). Within a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows, the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control. There is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery, we do not learn anything more. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable, nor is the atmosphere particularly special. The film could be disturbing to some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it.#0
3595_10#This movie has made me want to become a director, and Michelle Rodriguez is brilliant. How the hell wasnt she on mtvs top 25 under 25, she beats them all. This film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance, best film i have ever seen.#1
9718_7#POSSIBLE SPOILER - In some way  How to Alienate Friends.  is the  loser learns to adjust, becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more  type of story, situated in the celebrity business. - END OF SPOILER  Conclusion I think its a nice celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages, a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending.#1
6126_1#For that matter one of the worst FILMS ever made. Plot goes as follows. Slog through jungle looking areas for 10 minutes or so. Have Bo go somewhere and strip. Slog through the jungle some more. Give Bo another excuse to strip. Back to the jungle. Oh look! Theres a Tarzan looking guy! Strip, Bo - strip. Kill the safari people. Tarzan looking guy has a fight scene. Saves Bo. Bo strips. Run credits. Run credits, run.#0
9611_3#There are so many goofy things about this movie that I cant possibly name but a few On a comedy level, or as high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, its viewer beware. Therefore, see this only if a) you must see every western out there b) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments appeal to you. Woah¬Ö..#0
4189_8#Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie. He is a professional pickpocket. Hes been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark. Instead, it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953. The script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year.#1
8622_8#I just cant agree with the above comment - theres lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one, it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for its effective use of silence. Whats more, it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way, not pulling any punches in what it shows, yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter. it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema, and deserves a place amongst the canon of different horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on). Its definitely worth seeing if youre interested in the edges of horror cinema.#1
9762_3#Alan Alda plays real-life  Sports Illustrated  writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather wan, uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy. Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material, shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion (with macho commentary) and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy; still, by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up, he turns the main narrative into a jumble. Aldas smug, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes (and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Aldas girlfriend--hows that for a fantasy?).  1/2 from     #0
6061_10#I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. The musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production. Even though it is shot for those huge Imax theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system. The final magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, is loving father who proudly watches over his sons career. They work together so well that every father and son should see this. You can tell that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience.#1
1909_1#One of the worst romantic comedies (nay, worst movies) Ive ever seen. Boy (who works as a phone psychic!) must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams. Hilarity does not ensue. Boredom, light gay-bashing, and horrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his crappy dialogue, youll like this movie. Be smart. Avoid this. if you see it, destroy the copy.#0
8173_8#The brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. Its one of mans primal fears. This movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who I guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so its not really working out. In a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor Earl Boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot, which I guess is the absolute worst you can do when youre a killer dentist. Its a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written but theres gore. The plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey, its a killer dentist movie, weve all thought of it but they did it first.#1
10108_1#German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible hes unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made. I wont spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is its perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on or should I say his geist.#0
95_3#You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you dont particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and Im as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.#0
4274_10#I like this movie a lot, but its a fact, that you cannot understand it, unless youre from the ex Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegowina. Croatia. Slovenia. All of this was ex Yugoslavia, a melting pot of the Balcan nations. It could be a dream land, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists wouldnt poison the nations mind with their sick ideas.#1
11332_1#As big as a Texas prairie and equally as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills, and Dennis Hopper cant float this overbloated boat. Taylor actually LOOKS bad--wrong wardrobe, wrong hair, and wrong makeup--a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career. Hopper gives the only believable performance, and Dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually dont remember him for--a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what a, say, Redford could have done with the male lead. There is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes, just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other. Except for Hopper, there is no character development, only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery. To its credit, the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and it does have SIZE, making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests. Those with the DVD version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk. You wont be missing anything of interest.#0
1492_10#Mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story. Everyone probably has one, and this is writer-director Yasmin Ahmads story of hers, with a boy called Mukhsin. We know that her movies have been semi-autobiographical of sorts, having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences, and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen, that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty. Mukhsin is no different, and probably the most polished ad confident work to date (though I must add, as a personal bias, that Sepet still has a special place in my heart). Another highly recommended movie, and a rare one that I feel is suitable for all ages - bring along your kid brother or sister #1
1026_3#Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had. Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human Kermit the Frog act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just didnt work at all.#0
2809_8#The saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and NO-ONE felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards. Oh, and I will add a personal comment about AIDS. Despite everything, there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror. When AIDS first arrived, it was called the  gay cancer , and governments preferred to  let them die  rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags. Then it became clear that AIDS would also be a heterosexual disease. But the government wasnt ready for that; So when straight people began getting ill too, the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves (examples The Names Project the quilt memorializing all those who died of AIDS; Act Up etc) The result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them, because no other organizations existed. This close contact, in my estimation, is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals. When AIDS first came on the scene, many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if straights didnt suddenly become ill too; nevertheless, the strides that have been made in gay liberation - to the point that, as I write this, there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage - these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without AIDS to bring us together. It is sad to think that all those people - both straight and gay - had to die before our common humanity became more obvious - but if what I am writing here is true, and I think it is - then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain.#1
12456_3#Apparently Shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is. At one point in this film, someone (I believe Pacinos producer) warns him that film is getting off track, that it was once about how the masses think about Shakespeare through the vehicle of RICHARD III. Instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout. Some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for Al (was there really ANY reason for the quick visit to Shakespeares birthplace, other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there?), and, before the film has really even begun, we are treated to seeing Al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera. I thought his silly act with Kay near the end of GODFATHER III with the knife to his throat was AN ACT - but apparently its how Al really behaves in person. Its all just a bunch of sound and fury, signifying nada.#0
8649_9#I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night. I do like Juliette Lewis although Im indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this viewing I have to admit hes a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable, and I didnt think  Brad Pitt  at all. If you like NBK you may well like this movie, and vice-versa.#1
3031_2#Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kellys clich√©d, patchy, overwrought screenplay. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story  sort of . Dont be fooled by this films multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface. It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it.#0
9850_1#I felt brain dead, Ill tell you. This is the worst film I have ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought this was the Peter Jackson film of the same name). The performances are so terrible they are laughable. The special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire. The script promotes that kind of TV movie, stare into the middle distance kind of acting. The cast look as if they have been taking lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have one look each, and stick to it. Plus I have never been confused by a movie until I sat down to watch this. The is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes. Avoid like a plague.#0
2727_3#This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION doesnt really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. What she does do however, is shine when shes on screen. The near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some Warner contract players of the day. JANCIE RULE shows promise and its a shame she didnt become a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the  go-getter  with aplomb. Better if this was in color. The Travis Air force base locations with some rear projection work well. Whats best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. If you enjoyed THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN youll like this one.#0
3853_9#I dont know if Id consider it a masterpiece of not, but its damn near close; its extremely well made, artistic, suspenseful, intricately plotted, thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual-religious imagery. Theres also some great camera-work from Jan de Bont, an atmospheric score from Loek Dikker and outstanding acting from Jeroen Krabb√© and Ren√©e Soutendijk, the latter giving one of the most sneaky, subtle femme fatale performance Ive ever seen. Like many other European movies, this movie has an unashamed, non-judgmental attitude toward sex, nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and/or surrealistic (some would say blasphemous) images. In other words, if you cant bear the thought of seeing a lust-driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as Jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you. What surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess. It mixes the abstract/surreal/parallel fantasy-reality scenes and somehow makes it all work. Like any good mystery, you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses. There is NOT an out-of-left-field resolution here. The movie has direction, theres no needless filler and once it concludes, you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier. If you like the work of Ken Russell and David Lynch, I can almost guarantee you will love this movie. Hell, if¬†you have no idea who they even are, you still might like it. THE 4TH MAN was a huge art-house success in much of the world, but didnt make it over to the US until 1984, where it was awarded the Best Foreign Film of the year from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. The most common video is the Media release, which has been horribly dubbed. Try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled Anchor Bay DVD release. Since coming to America, Verhoevens career has had its ups and downs. He has made a few decent films (Flesh & Blood, RoboCop) and some lousy ones (Showgirls). In fact, Verhoevens big hit Basic Instinct is almost like a less interesting, junior league version of The Fourth Man. Soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in America and since GRAVE SECRETS (1989) and EVE OF DESTRUCTION (1991) were the best offers she was getting, she headed right back home to the Netherlands.#1
7255_9#This is not a movie you watch for entertainment, at least most people I know would not. I wish I could screen it at school, along with the other two movies - however finding a copy of it showed to be pretty hard - which is a shame.#1
11968_10#Full House is a great show. I am still today growing up on it. I started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it. i fell in love with all of the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite. she had such a sense of humor. in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show, you should because you will get hooked on it. i became hooked on it after the first show i saw, which just happened to be the first episode, in 2002. it really is a good show. i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families. and its great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages. and for all parents, it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life. nothing terrible happens, like violence or swearing. it is just a really great sit-com. i give it 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think? OH and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office. It will make you feel a lot better. Trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better. and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid, well thats too bad for you because you wont get as far in life even if you are happy with your life. you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it. i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show. well i need must go to have some lunch. remember you must start watching full house and soon!#1
3749_9#I laughed a lot while watching this. Its an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization. The dialog is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully. Theres Max, who has apparently led a horrible life. And theres Edward, who isnt sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edwards insane boss. Tom has a short role but a memorable one. Highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I am a fan of all of Jasons cartoons and cant wait to see what he comes out with next.#1
2434_8#Ive often wondered just how much CASPER was meant for childrenwith all the issues revolving around his identity (in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, as his home is a cemetery plot), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film. Maybe Casper was meant more as a morality play, or Famous Studios felt like breaking new ground in reality cartoons. This might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children--but I wouldnt pop it into the VCR for a perky cartoon break.#1
8913_9#This is my favorite classic. It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia, PA when I was 13, in 1957, and released the next year. Then in 1970, I found myself working the very same county as a rookie PA state trooper. I have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well, and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the  home of the blob . The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and it is still showing films today #1
10764_9#Its a good movie maybe I like it because it was filmed here in PR. The actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome! The guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls.#1
9019_8#Not wishing to give  anything  away here, I would just say this technically excellent, flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a halfs entertainment It will amuse, surprise, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clich√©d or predictable in any way. Most definitely recommended. A previous Users Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carters outstanding performances - I agree entirely.#1
8996_1#In the future of 1985, a governmental committee headed by Howard Hesseman, is holding hearings on TVs first uncensored network. They sample its programming, that play as a series of skits. I can name the good skit movies on one hand, not using my thumb.  Amazon Women on the Moon ,  Kentucky Fried Movie ,  The Meaning of Life , and  Mr. Mikes Mondo Video . Notice how I didnt mention  Tunnel Vision ? The reason for that is that this movie is death in cinematic form. None of the skits are even remotely funny, or even the least bit clever. It takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers part to not even get one laugh out of me. Eye Candy Dody Dorn goes full frontal#0
2152_1#this film tries to be immensely clever, and Tarantino-like  this film is rubbish. its all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a 6.8 rating. the film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired porno!#0
7169_8#Typically,  kids  films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13. But then again, thats before Holes hit the scene. Sure, it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray. What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didnt try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine, kind of like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar, redemptive ending to it). The only down side? The hokey looking lizards. Overall, however, an 8/10.#1
11501_2#A romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class  artist  with a comfortable upbringing It is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks, boyish jokes. They do never look for work, the do almost never experience rejection or anguish, etc. Living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school Ridiculous. Specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of Ken Loach, etc.#0
4698_1#I mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car? So what if their ten, Its way too immature for a little kid to sing about  being my women  I mean seriously! The name is pretty corny too, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants??? HOW CREATIVE.I dont get why they need a TV show I mean most artist dont really need a TV show about themselves, especially the naked brothers band. Heck how many of them are in the freaking group. And seriously whats with the movie? Jeez Nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously The naked brother band? SO many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the Naked Brothers band, its a stupid, uncreative show that should not be aired onto TV.#0
5426_10#Its about time that Gunga Din is released on DVD. I cannot accurately say how many times I have watched this fine film but, I never tire of it. The lead actors worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. The Soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them. At the end, Din is honored as he is made an honorary Corporal in the British Army.#1
4863_2#Why oh why dont blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point? Everyone in the cinema, young and old, was there to see talking animals make jokes, and whilst they did that we were all happy And then, as with Lost In Space, came the two killer blows - plot and sentiment. Who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether Eddie Murphy made up with his daughter? Not me, thats for sure.#0
5242_1#well, i hated knocked up, i despised 40-year-old virgin, and this little gem is a worthless piece of trash movie. do yourself a favor, and skip it. i admit, i dont like the actors in this movie, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the cover of the DVD, i was like,  i wouldnt like that movie,  but at his insistence, i decided to give it a try, unfortunately.  i should have known better; next time i will.#0
11764_3#I have to say I was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films. I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack(which I listened to before I saw the film) sounded different from others, maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces(apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors) and supposedly dealed within its script with modern social behaviour, maybe because its photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical. The film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser, and a major letdown. What Serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned  battle of the sexes  as in  all men are the same  and  why is it that all women;  blah,blah,blah. Nothing new in it, not even that, it uses so much common ground and clich√® that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female/male condition. Full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clich√®s I talked about before(those always work, always) and screaming performances(it is a well acted film in its context)..and by screaming I mean, literally. The at first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be according to Serrano the more pathetic ones. I completely disagree with Serrano, they shouldnt have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come throughhe made sure we got HIS message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood. Anyway, it is after all, a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it (if you accept to be manipulated by it).#0
4252_4#   Possible Spoilers    4/10 Movie-Man#0
708_4#The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. RiChard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I cant say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. Hes one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. Im currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but Im glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too real  for me. I prefer Lestat and Louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I dont want to give anything away) Sorry, but its just not my type of show.#0
4713_8#One the whole, this movie isnt perfect. It doesnt hang well together as the story line is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes. This movie is no home run. But like Porkys, it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable.#1
3839_1#Some films are so bad that theyre good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about as true to the story as Pinocchios chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible, the direction was poor, and it travelled way too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home. Watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast.#0
3782_4#Heres the good news first.  Spirit  is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. The artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone. For all the incredible new animation technology on display in  Spirit , the story is almost  astonishingly  dull. There is a lesson here, and (needless to say) it doesnt just apply to animated movies. You can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we dont care about your characters, its bad film-making. Simple as that. The animation is still mind-blowing; I just cant wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it.#0
7872_10#The first review I saw of Page 3 said  what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say? . Should he say something so decisive. The movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic. I wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead. So watch Page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times.#1

10777_9#Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. The movie doesnt take a happy or sad approach on things, it just tells us a story, one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters, it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again, feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry at times, it will shock you and comfort you, it will give you and take from you. Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life, and that of my friends, and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours.#1
8097_7#Godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one, and probably the strongest kind that could be made about Ralph Bakshis take on Tolkiens magnum opus the Lord of the Rings, has actually been made by Peter Jackson. The recent trilogy, to me, arent even total masterpieces, but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post-modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good, sweeping entertainments.  If youre a fan of the books contemplating checking this out, I would say its worth a chance, even if its one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. As for it fitting into Bakshis other films Ive seen its an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement, where as with Lynchs Dune its bound to draw a dark, mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who dont. I dont.#1
1748_8#From the very beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is possibly the funniest Ive ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm this September. I dont recommend going to this movie if you arent a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. However, when you are at the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes arent  gay jokes,  theyre just jokes. And theyre funny.#1
10714_2#For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was awful. Fast forwarded it and never got any better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought that she would be so great in the comedy. The previews were so great, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a chick flick, it sucked. What is up with that. Movie was very slow ans boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like my money back for this one! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant. I thought that it was going to be so funny, I have had my own children and I have helped others have children. It could have been more along the lines of reality.#0
9410_7#I enjoyed this film. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. It was amusing at times, but really, it wasnt very funny at all. If Id been expecting it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, I found it to be enjoyable and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man whos less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. Hes absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; me, I compare it to The Fountainhead.#1
431_4#Admittedly, I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. He was a fine actor until Scent of a Woman, where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably. I hoped this film, of which Id heard almost nothing growing up, would be a nice little gem. An overlooked, ahead-of-its-time, intelligent and engaging city-political thriller. Its not. Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and were left with several  confession  monologues, that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the  real world  of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal. I dont think were left with that in City Hall, and while its a very full film, I dont find it altogether rich.#0
1087_1#This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. While featuring good actors the movie doesnt live up to the expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors, loud and dramatic music. It doesnt change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. Earned itself a score of 1.#0
3884_1#Many moons ago when I was seven years old, I can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie. It appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. Being the wise adults that they are, they told me  Absolutely not! Its a bunch of trash.  Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid on my block to see the  Incredible Melting Man.  Dont make the same mistake that I did. Listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie. They were right.#0
7505_9#If theres one genre that Ive never been a fan of, its the biopic. Always misleading, filled with false information, over-dramatized scenes, and trickery all around, biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. Skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and moviegoers objected to Gretchen Mol given the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didnt have the chops for the part. I never doubted Mol could handle the part since, but I never expected to as blown as away by her performance as I was upon just viewing the film hours ago. Mol delivers a knockout Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950s pin-up girl, who, after an early life of abuse (depicted subtlety and tastefully done, something few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time. The picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story. Director/co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turners fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending. Still, credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully. Come Oscar time, Mol, Turner, and Harron should be receiving nominations. Doubt it will happen, though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them. 9/10#1
12350_9#Im not sure how I missed this one when it first came out, but I am glad to have finally seen it. I recommend  The Sea is Watching  to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if theyre not a fan. It is a lovely, quiet and soul sustaining movie, and one to be treasured for any movie collection.#1
4532_7#This was Keatons first feature and is in actuality three shorts, set in different periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age) on the eternal triangle of romance. The stories parallel each other as in Griffiths INTOLERANCE, which this was intended to satirize. The strengths of the jokes and gags almost all rely on anachronisms, bringing modern day business into ancient settings. Lots of fun and full of laughs.#1
246_3#This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Vernes  Mysterious Island . The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the directors voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress.  OK now stand up.  As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actors voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Pipers early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? A must watch for aspiring film makers.#0
2967_9#Ernest Borgnine was so wasted in this movie.There was no point in putting this great actor in this movie.One of the greatest actors in the world wasted,and for what reason, none what so ever,so america if you want to put classic actors in movies DONT WASTE THEM#1
11390_1#This isnt a movie. It is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair, dead-pan stare, ipod and nervous tic - probably shot it herself in a creative phase. Whats next? Six directors shooting social intercourse at the Wal-Mart snack counter?#0
10439_1#Id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot(!) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie Ive ever seen! I cant believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.#0
8908_4#This series was CBS networks answer to the success of the Big Valley. It was a 90 minute Western just like the ABC program was. While it was an answer, it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2. This is a show that I would not want DVDs of, & frankly hope they are never released. Think since CBS was running out of lots, they re-used many familiar settings. This was one the last western series CBS produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970s.#0

7394_9#This Chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture I dont belong and are far from. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps one to relate to each character, and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things. Get it. You wont be disappointed.#1
489_7#Walking home after the film, I was humming the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were dancing to. Ive heard that before - where? Ah, from Kubricks  Eyes Wide Shut  (track 2), got it just as I arrived at the door. Its  Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2  composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack from Towers. What a treat! The film score by Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz. Its not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score. Reminds me of favorite scores by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (beginning notes of track 6 have traces of  Nuovo cinema Paradiso ), Georges Delerue, and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings, celeste, piano, and harp.  I highly recommend the soundtrack if you dont feel like going to the movies. Alexandre Desplats lyrical film score of  The Luzhin Defence  is complete.#1
2284_10#This is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. I am very impressed at the film, not just for the plot and superb acting, but that such a unique movie was made. Most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking Brit or a mighty battle, but not this. This isnt about this kind of war, its about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. Going back to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi haters, providing for interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. Nolte more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what its asking.#1
1700_4#In film, I feel as though it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on screen. This short from David Lynch tells a story but not much of one. I felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. It is good film-making but there really isnt anything else to it. As Ive said before, I am a huge David Lynch fan but I get frustrated by some of his work because I dont see a need for it at all. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know hes still got a ton of talent and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check this out but dont be surprised when you dont like it very much.#0
2261_10#I saw this movie, and the play, and I have to add that this was the most touching story that I had ever seen. Until I saw this movie I was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults that were and are living in that era. It brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive, And to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing. This simply surpass a five star, I rate it a ten. Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that lays heavy in my heart.If there is a VHS, or DVD out there on the play, Please notify me ASAP.Thank You. PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance.#1
2289_9#Im a rather pedestrian person, with somewhat lowbrow tastes. However, I occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my attempts. I was in awe throughout the entire movie. I liked it so much that I got my own tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie. I saw it as a huge question to the viewer What is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept, can be asked to accept, should accept? As a military member, this is of course an important question to me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie. Recommended.#1
8010_7#I previously thought that this film was the lamest of the Muppet films. I would like now to retract that statement. In my opinion now, the lamest MUppet film was the TV movie ITS A VERY MERRY MUPPET Christmas, am ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE rip off that was truly dreadful. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas.  The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was the real showstopper, with Muppets from Sesame Street even appearing for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his final line What better way could anything end?. But I wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining. There are cute cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the late, great Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly entertains. I must state though that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three defininitive MUppet movies.#1
9721_2#Who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists? Whats intended to be a light, frothy comedy about neighbor children who cant give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood, comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self-indulgence. As children, the pair are unbearably precocious; as adults theyre intolerably immature. Its a bad combination.#0
8351_9#I remember hitch hiking to Spain at 25, getting a lift from, what turned out to be, two fleeing Italian small crooks. They were doing a lot outside the law, but from the other side carrying a little portrait of Jesus in the pocket for their protectionJust and unjust, good and bad, criminal and correct where here in a new combination, outside of the categories I used to know. Les Valseuses gives me, although a film and not real life, a picture close to my own experiences the intenseness of each moment as soon as you leave all behind and go for the momentous, whatever comes your way, its another state of mind and also dangerous form of life, because, as we all know, there are people who are not ready for this and willing to persecute you for stealing and so onThis film touches values, its a story about whats right and wrong morals. Its resurrection of the individual fighting him/ herself free against the false morals and conformismTheres danger all the way, because, how far can you go with your own freedom and crossing your own moral borders and that of other people? What to do with people who are willing to hurt you, put you in jail or even shoot at you for the things that you do, like  stealing  some petrol from a multinational oil company for you fifth hand car? Les Valseuses re-awakens these questions in me, because morality, in contradiction to the usual media message, is quite complex#1
4845_1#There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award. Well, it does not deserve an audience as well. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly, the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least. Every frame, you feel you are getting the  full picture , its like someone is  cropping your view  from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I will be honest, I could not bear to watch the entire movie. The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. Take my advice, stay away from this piece of crap.#0
5225_9#I think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best National Lampoons films, it also has a very catchy spoof title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about. Men In White  The story is a spoof of many films including a Will Smith film, as you might have guessed, Men In Black. I will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (Garbage Cans). Also, they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The acting is not superb, actually, it is not very good, but that is what makes the film funny, it is a comedy, loosen up  I love the story line, partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (Or should it be Un-subtle) they rip off all the other films. I am great fan of un-serious spoof films, but i am also a fan of the real thing, and with this films, it is hard to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, but this film carries it off successfully. The two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called Little Britain. This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best storyline, National Lampoons film to date #1
3843_3#In the days before gore and sex took over, real horror films were made. Castle of Blood is, in my estimation, one of the finest, although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others, which was in the theaters a couple of years ago. Sadly, few general interest viewers will ever hear of, much less see, this film. That is a shame, for this one is a cut above the rest. I got my copy from Sinister Cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else. For persons interested in this genre, it is a must see.#0
10632_1#There are so many incorrect statements in this so-called  documentary  that I found myself shouting at the television. How do I get that 40-odd minutes of my life back?#0
942_10#This is the best film version of Dickens classic tale. Ive seen it over and over on VHS, and recently acquired the DVD version, which is formatted for TV (not wide-screen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films/shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward,  the Equalizer , as the Ghost of Christmas Present.#1
11109_9#The Sopranos stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting the story in the milieu of the underworld, David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post-modern era.  PS A good companion piece to Chases series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting.#1
4922_4#DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on Sky Movies in Britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until it`s first broadcast on network television tonight . Actually seeing as I`m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . My theory was proved right for the most part  There are some positives in DRACULA 2000 like the visuals for example . This is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot , but it`s something we should expect from Hollywood over the last few years - A very good looking movie that`s very dumb#0
3201_2#Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and therehe was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he cant do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Dons partner is killed so he kills the killers brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite bad and you wont find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Dons character. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.#0
11354_1#I, also having endured hundreds of childrens movies in the past, consider this to be one of the worst I have ever seen. In all its just crude, badly animated, even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view.#0
5452_4#As far as films go, this is likable enough. Entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting enough story. I would have really quite liked it had I not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in. Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet every character is English (save for Seans girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs & roles. As a Scottish woman (& as a viewer who likes her  real life  films to be a bit more like real life) I really dont think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented Scottish actorsor at least got English ones who could toss together a decent accent! The futile attempt at using the word  wee  a few times did nothing but to further the insult.#0
6385_10#This movie was great! It was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie with no singing. Perfect. 10 out of 10.#1
8909_9#This is a pretty well known one so i wont get too deep into it. The basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor. Human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger. Nobody believes the teens (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it seems that the blob cant be stopped. Its really well done for its age and unlike a lot of other 50s flicks the pace is pretty fast. The story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. If you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from 88 as well.#1
2640_2#Trying to conceive of something as insipid as THE SENTINEL would be pretty difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes. There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel as to be laughable. The action is too easily stymied by the  What the?  responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie.#0
2275_7#American playwright Howard W. Campbell, Jr. (played with a musty obsolescence by Nick Nolte) lives happily in Germany with his actress wife, Helga Noth (Sheryl Lee) before the beginning of World War II. At the peak of his life, Howard is drafted by an American agent (John Goodman) to become a spy on behalf of the Allies; forewarned of the risks the job holds, Howard has everything to lose, but finds the offer irresistible. Following the death of his wife and the end of the war, Campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in New York City, which muddies his neuroses even further. The central question (indeed, a question that has frustrated many critics) of the movie and Kurt Vonneguts source novel is,  is Campbell a hero or a traitor?  Director Keith Gordon and screenwriter Robert B. Weide offer us clues, but no answer, and this ambiguity¬ñthis NOT knowing¬ñis what keeps  Mother Night  fresh and interesting throughout. At the beginning of the film, Nolte portrays Campbell as intelligent and confident; by the end, hes either scared and uncertain, or scared and COMPLETELY certain of his contribution/debt to humanity for the role he played in the war. Gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the films first half, which complement his portrait of the Nazi bourgeoisie and captures Vonneguts dramatic side. On the flip side, when Campbell is confined to his lonely New York apartment (which he affectionately calls  purgatory ) only to be discovered by a group of Nazis, the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author, and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds. The moral (even spiritual) paradox  Mother Night  presents doesnt lend itself to simple resolution, and to a degree, should be left ambiguous¬ñthe black-and-white scenes of Campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in Israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy to¬ñas Campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about; the war changes him, coming back to America changes him, and meeting up with the Nazis in New York compels him to prolong the facade of his  act  even further, to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall, spewing anti-Semitic bile. Perhaps thats the best reaction we could hope for.#1
10035_9#I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast, and  unsinkable  until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film. So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). Theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying ( http tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber)(idk he was so nice), Lovejoy(David Warner), Murdoch(Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith(Bernard Hill), Molly Brown(Kathy Bates), and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome#1
7734_10#I saw this film a few years ago and I got to say that I really love it.Jason Patric was perfect for this weird role that he played.The director?I dont too many things about himand I dont care.The screenplay is good,thats for sure.In just a few words I have to say about this movie that is weird,strange,even dark,but its a good one.I saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then.I want to see it again and again.I know that Im not gonna get sick of watching it.The scenes,the atmosphere,the actors,the storyeverything is good.The movie should have lasted longer.I think 120 minutes should have been perfect.I was hoping for a part 2 for this movie.Too bad it dint happened.Jason Patricyoure the man ! very good movie. the end. -)#1
11830_9#This is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork. The only negatives I found were Pacinos voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonnas off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those  faults  are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie.a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion..like nothing you have ever seen.#1
3311_4#Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes award. Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of silliness will ensue. However, the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny. It is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998s Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation. The casting of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Graces romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all. And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing? Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants.#0
826_3#I love these actors, but they were wasted in this flick. Debra Winger just phoned it in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked  Breaking the Waves , youll probably like this too. I hated both. 3/10#0
455_4#Even thought Im not the biggest of Cher fans, this movie was her crowning achievement. Granted, there were long term side-effects and risks of brain damage, memory loss (and) intellectual impairment, upon the screening such a film. A 1989 survey of Moonstruck fans by the UK Advocacy Network revealed that one-third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed Moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds. Assuming free and fully informed Consent, it is well to reaffirm the individuals right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses. But we might ask ourselves whether we, as fans of cinema, though in no way sworn to any Hippocratic Oath, should be offering it.#0
4239_10#My observations Postwar hilarity. Tom Drake and Grandpa from  Meet Me in St. Louis  two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed charming and pretty. Margaret Hamilton good as always; smaller part than in  Wizard of Oz . Spring Byington way prettier, also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by Hamilton. Tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious. As a two year veteran of Army tents, he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. 10/10#1
5067_10#Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Grey Owl is best character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I do not know if he had better nor worse roles, Im not his fan, but this one was really exceptional. And little bit more. I pay my respect to the original Grey Owl.#1
7053_7#Dont mistake  War Inc.  for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. It isnt. For all the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge.#1
3029_8#The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what Greene wrote; for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the murdered-child obsession that takes over some of the plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to the ludicrous. Its a dreadful shame that the films not available on DVD.#1
2031_1#While William Shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in, (and I especially love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down. Thats a given#0
10833_3#I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost. I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end, little did I know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. My DVD player still hasnt forgiven me and I dont blame it one bit. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.#0
636_10#Why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome  Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is engaging and funny from moment one, original, and well-acted. I wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves! For anyone that loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. There are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characterseven down to facial expressions.#1
12305_8#Wasnt quite sure what to expect with this one, outside of the uniform positive reviews Ive read. Turns out, I could have never imagined this movie, because its very close to  The Bride with White Hair  in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic. This walks a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling. Theres nothing scary about it, thats not the theme, its really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost, who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. This also takes place in ancient China, with wild outlandish Kung Fu exhibitions, and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are top rate all the way. I could watch this genre of Chinese movies all day, because they are highly entertaining, great visuals, and pretty much tongue-in-cheek. And Im looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also. Highly recommended.#1
6217_1#I seriously cant believe Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, two people I LOVE, signed on to produce this crap. Tim Burton is a brilliant director, but to be honest Ive been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations. He did produce the brilliant  Nightmare Before Christmas , which is one Ive watched multiple times, and directed movies like  Beetlejuice  and  Sleepy Hollow , which are awesome films. Bekmambetov directed 3 films that I LOVE Night Watch, Day Watch, and Wanted. Ive only seen those three of his, but they prove hes an awesome director. While its true that this movie is very pretty looking, pretty is as pretty does, and 9 does squat. Im sure Burton fans will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie without a doubt, in fact with his and Bekmambetovs names being thrown around the promos, people will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie. I know I may be making a big deal out of nothing, but watching this movie made me realize how much I hate movies with unlikeable characters, nonexistent plot and just pure style over content. And this movie is one of those movies.#0
5694_4#Ill be honest- the reason I rented this movie was because I am a huge fan of Kyle Chandlers (most notably from Early Edition). Since he usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him as in a different role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also drew me in; a wanna-be hitman (Tony Greco- a.k.a. Mr. Chandler) must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life- or, rather, the death- of a witness who will testify against someone in  the family . The movies was nothing like I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, youd know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically- it was filthy, and made little sense. Yes, it was a mob movie, and yes the guns do go BOOM. But theres more to a movie than that. This film acted as if it didnt have the time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it. The acting really made up for it- James Belushi was pretty amusing as  The Rose . Sheryl Lee made Angel seem as believable as she could get. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to  the family . If only the script did justice to the actors.#0
3041_7#It is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film, whereas `Patton- Lust for Glory, producer Frank McCarthys earlier biography of a controversial American general from the Second World War, has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments. Like a previous reviewer, I am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other. On a pedantic note, the map which MacArthur is shown using during the Korean War shows the DMZ, the boundary between the two Korean states that did not come into existence until after the war. (The pre-war boundary was the 38th parallel). Also, I think that MacArthur was referring to the `tocsin of war. War may be toxic, but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin.#1
8958_3#I wasnt really fond of the first  Cube  movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much. Didnt really feel the need to see its sequel but when I heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the originals problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. Well I thought wrong. Again failing to impress on anything but weak characters, dialog and acting  Cube Zero  is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie.#0
1146_7#This movie is about a fictional soap opera. It is very fast and funny. To say anything else would ruin the movie. There are several plots and sub plots in the movie. This movie has ensemble cast with todays hottest stars. They all gives over the top performances. This movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera /or prime time soap opera If you watch soap go check this movie its hilarious #1
6013_1#Ive read every book to date in the left behind series, and the movie hardly does any of them justice. Sure, Ive seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good MST3K episode. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt like the actors were reading their lines, instead of actually saying them. The characters were stiff and unlikeable. The effects were cheesy, and looked terribly fake. The ending was awful. First of all, it didnt even go all the way through the first book. Second, it made no sense. If you hadnt read the book, youd have no idea what was going on. It had to have been the most cheesy, film student-like ending Ive ever seen in a movie. Im upset that I actually paid money for this movie. If by some miracle, it does get wide release, they ought to totally overhaul it and let Hollywood take over. Those two wannabe film producers, and the wannabe director should leave movie making to the professionals.#0
2719_10#I saw this film after watching Capote and Infamous. It is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie. The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay. Fascinating film.#1
5325_7#The idea of making a film about the Beatles sounds doomed idea, as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic Beatles. Then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available Beatles material. This is exactly what Birth of the Beatles offers to us, the simple story known to us without any extravaganza. The guys who play the Beatles in this production scarcely look like the originals, but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate. The guy who plays Lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either. Brian Epstein is great and the moment when he sacks Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film. Also as a bonus you get to see the original Cavern club in the film.#1
6598_1#This  film  is a travesty. No, wait--an abomination. NO, WAIT--this is without a doubt the absolute WORST film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors. Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have been dead, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. Why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for L & H would be in the persona of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain is beyond me. I tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and I certainly wasnt disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with Hollywood and film-making. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS--YOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED.#0

7498_10#This is a bizzare look at Als  life , back when he still a hyper 20-something. The (real) home videos of Al as a kid are great, and the commentary from his (real life) parents gives a nice glimpse of just how Weird Al wound up as screwed up as he is. This video is a must own for any devoted Al-coholic.#1
1488_10#This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family. Two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me #1

4312_4#This one acts as a satire during the womens rights movement era. Of course, that doesnt mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold. It runs into the same vein as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still tame), and is basically standard fare fluff. What I mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize. Anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste. Its the same feeling you may get after watching this. A nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a mans duty, but I expected better things.#0
4559_10#My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyones jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film. My point Parents of young children, i suggest your children watch this movie with you, so theyll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they dont stare at them like theyre aliens. My sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people, that people who might not seem  normal  are people too. 10/10#1
6771_7#so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered. i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly i like the  less violent  part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now. I thought it interesting that Belisarios Airwolf and JAG have similar theme - the lead actor (Hawke and Harm) both are looking for an MIA relative (brother, father). wonder if Robert Belisarios personal life mimics these 2 shows theme. Question - does anyone have pictures of Hawkes cabin. I love that cabin (kinda like a dream cabin of mine) and that is one of the scenes i remember about Airwolf.#1
9124_10#Bar some of the questionable acting (there musicians at the end of the day), this in the words of Quentin Tarrinno is  The best rock movie ever madeperiod  Prince provides a solid performance, as does Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent script, good direction, great plot, and spectacular performances. Not forgetting the some of the best rock/pop/funk music you will ever hear.#1
10027_7#Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d  n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and wont do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie  Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.#1
5500_10#This Documentary (Now available free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone must see this. But the poor of Venezuela didnt believe the media. They went to the Palace in their millions and demanded that Chavez be returned. In the face of such overwhelming numbers, the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the US. Chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation.#1
2331_10#At first I was weirded out that a TV shows main character could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought Id give it a shot. Guess what? I love  Pushing Daisies  and look forward to Wednesday nights just to watch it, then for the next week I watch it a few more times on my DVR. The colorful characters, witty banter, fast-paced dialogue, and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end. Ned and Chuck Charles relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact. Even Detective Emerson Cods character has continued to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She cracks me up! The narrators voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that I am watching a movie instead of a TV show. I have recommended my family and friends to turn on  Pushing Daisies  and they are hooked too  The show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen  P.D. , I highly recommend watching it #1
7841_4#I thoroughly enjoyed A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played like a typical sequel. Everything about it -- budget, script, plot, casting, and acting -- was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe, looks nothing like an Indian, and neither do half of the other  Indians,  who were played by Italians, Mexicans, and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors. He even used the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a superb job in the original, seems to be coasting this time around. I guess he couldnt resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as Horse. To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as Horses undergoing a painful purification ritual to  find his vision  and rally the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but on the whole, Return is uneven, boring, corny, and predictable -- just like most sequels.#0
3573_7#this film was almost a great imaginative film. A mixture of shakespeare, pop, jazz, and faerie tales. This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. Featuring a strong cast, headed by the perfectly cast Kathleen Turner, this movie had everything going for it. Everything but production values. I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with an over the top production like this, it came off with the same seedy quality as every other made for tv movie. Besides better cinematography, this film was almost perfect. #1
12042_10#..as I was when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us; the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book. If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM #1
11803_7# Sasquatch Hunters  actually wasnt as bad as I thought. Rated R Graphic Language, Violence and some graphic carcasses#1
3599_8#This movie is a real gem. The arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives completely believable. The dialogue is fresh, and oh so real. The situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed. Until the climax, that is. Then its as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable. But I dont want to discourage people from watching this film. The first 3/4s of it are truly remarkable. I gave it an 8. There are some remarkable performances here. Check out this movie.#1
3239_10#Why do I like DISORGANIZED CRIME so much? Why do I chuckle or laugh out loud any time I think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie? Its kind of hard to explain, but Ill give it a try. First of all, its very funny indeed - in contrast to what lots of  official  reviews want you to believe. But then again, that depends entirely on your sense of humour, so there is no sense in arguing about that. Often the humour is in the dialogue, and often it is situational comedy. There is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck. When the farmer drops them, they just stand there by the road, covered all over with cow s    or whatever. They are totally unnerved; then, realizing the humour of the scene, they one by one start laughing about themselves, and Ruben Blades (as Carlos), looking (and certainly smelling) terrible, nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath (simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again!). Which leads to the second point the acting. Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, Ruben Blades and Corbin Bernsen (okay, the latter overdoes it a bit at times) all fit and play their parts beautifully - in fact, you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film. Thirdly, there is the plot . Jim Kouf, the director and screenwriter, is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves. More often than not, there is no real action, and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss (Bernsen) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even-tually, grudgingly, like each other. The movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot - totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences, yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details. Incidentally, the title of the film is one of the best I have ever come across, because it per-fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way. Therefore, take my advice watch this film, but if you dont chuckle, grin or smile during the first 10 minutes, forget it - its not your type of film. PS. The only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how, do tell me.#1
10864_8#It might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films, but I think its the best way to give an approximation of the place Election occupies in the gangster genre arena. It works somewhere in between The Godfather and Kinji Fukasakus yakuza opus The Yakuza Papers (AKA Battles Without Honour and Humanity), in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic, dark and gritty. But its also a Johnnie To film, and as such it carries the distinct touch of the Hong Kong auteur. If youre familiar with Tos style, then you should know what to expect. The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. The cinematography is great, slick and dark in equal measures, utilizing dark hues (brown, dark green and orange) while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it. In the end, Election occupies a peculiar place. Its not exactly a character study and its not an action-oriented gangster film. It explores a situation (the election and its aftermath), but does so in style, and is both realistic and romanticized (the Triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental Godfather).#1
1356_4#I firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a  spoof . Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally introduced the film at the screening I saw in Chicago. He had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy.  What is it?  is Crispin Glovers attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by Herzog, Lynch etc. In other words just watch the trailer, be entertained, and leave it at that. There are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases, but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment.#0
4342_1#I have to say this is one of the worst films Ive ever seen. They had a pretty good storyline to go on, but than the messed it up so badly. First of all the cast is all wrong, where did that van peeble(crap actor btw) and puff daddy come from??? It looks like Carlito has come from the hood, and used to hang about with some real idiots. This film doesnt do  Carlitos Way  any justice. Im so happy that the sequel  Carlitos Way  came out first, if I had seen this rubbish first, I would have never given the pacino version a chance. And anyway, pacino is supposed to have read this story, thought its crap and did the sequel instead. Carlitos Way Rise to Power - 1 out of 10. Carlitos Way - 9 out of 10.#0
4359_10#One woman, by herself in a house for 45-minutes of screen time, doesnt sound like a formula to hold you on the edge-of-your-seat but FUTURE SHOCK is truly as thrilling as they come!

1137_8#Its very very funny. You know, just like a comedy is supposed to be. It also looks very very good, like a Hollywood Spectacular should. So, what more do you want? Howz about a very VERY good Sally Fields. She is so much better here than in anything else Ive ever seen her in, and she looks so damn good. This movie is all you need to understand why shes a Star. Those eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, everyones eyes are so good. I used to pretend to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend. Wed do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner. They dont do that at all in Soap Dish. Great. The Eyes Have It! (sorry)  Soap Dish is better than I thought itd be, better that I wanted it to be. Im sick of Movies that tell me Im supposed to care about shallow, self centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. TV Soap Actors. Soap Dish seems happy just to have me laugh at em. Thank You.#1
8976_7#Starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the World War II years. When youve got such stars as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, and Randolph Scott, etc., in the film and with such people as the Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn supplying the music, its an easy to take film. And the plot isnt even in the way. This is the oldest of clich√©s when you say they dont make them like this any more, but they really dont because you dont have a studio system that has all this talent under contract. Thats one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn.#1
11667_9#The Secret of Kells is a film Ive been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. Im here to tell you now its been worth the wait. The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as Id feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page. The characterisation is superb, I love Brendan Gleesons voice as the stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of the sprite Aisling. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well realised, a mix of fact and fantasy. and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. Im a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know whove seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that its a lovely little film. I will definitely buy the DVD when its released, and would like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. May there be many more. ) Coming back in here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nominated.#1
11704_3#One of those,  Why was this made?  movies. The romance is very hard to swallow. It is one of those romances, that, suddenly,  click  - they are in love. The movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments - the drive-in restaurant being the most notable. Charles Grodin does a credible job but for most of the movie its just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, do you want to watch Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with her neurosis together for a hour and half?#0
10952_10#Sarah Silverman is a dangerous Bitch! Shes beautiful, sexy, funny and talent, dark and demonic. I read the other comment on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just dont get it. Nothing that appears on T.V. is an accident. Too much money, time and work is put into the production of a T.V. show for there to be mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid. This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile. I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre. Its a lot like Pee-Wees Playhouse for maladjusted, slacker twenty-something glue sniffing, Future Pornstars of America from the Valley. The cast is awesome. The scenarios and action is well-paced. I hope this show succeeds since Comedy Central didnt let David spade keep his show. Who plays Sarahs sister? She not in the cast listing on the shows home page. I would love to see her stand-up. Does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or DVDs that may be floating around out there?#1
3174_9#Very rarely does one come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The writer director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work, but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate. The script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer, but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you cant help but commit to Ernie as a character. Very funny stuff. Despite the tiny budget Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look. Hes not messing around when it comes to making a good movie. I cant wait to see what he comes up with next. This guy can make people laugh and think; thats special.#1
10581_10#An opium den, a dirty little boy (actually a midget), prostitutes galore, a violent fracas in a dive, a motel for sexual shenanigans, scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot, a boozer falling down the stairs, a racially mixed client√®le in a bar with Asians, Africans, and Anglos treated equally, does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall? Wrong. These are all scenes from a 1933 musical. Though not nearly as socially conscious as  Gold Diggers of 1933,   Footlight Parade  stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen.#1
11587_2#This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It offers nothing in the death department. The one-liners are bad and are something that shouldnt be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th one, but still one the worst movies of the series. My rating 2/10#0
5159_2#Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. It initially looks great but ultimately provides NO satisfaction--none. The film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on. I really am unsure why it was made in the first place--it certainly wasnt made to provide any sort of entertainment.#0
3890_10#This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years. His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it. I HIGHLY recommend this one. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the ending jokes in French are quite good, because you dont have to speak French to get it (although if you do, it is still hilarious). Also, the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but funny the first time. Skip over those if you can. Its almost not worth watching. However, this really is a funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see.  I was dead at the time!  #1

11596_3# The Dream Child  of 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated)  Nightmare  series, and at the latest from this point on, the series became total garbage. The only good films in the series were Wes Cravens 1984 original, and the third part,  The Dream Warriors  of 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for (admittedly great) visuals, and one creepy scene, a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came into existence. The rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester yelling stupid one-liners, and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses, who desperately try to avoid falling asleep, because good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, such as a super-dumb eerie childrens rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel In Short No originality, just a decline of the old formula, and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals, and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel,  Freddys Dead , which is awful beyond belief. In case youre not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast,  The Dream Child  should be avoided, and even if you are, this is more than likely to disappoint.#0
10534_1#Perhaps its because I am so in love with the William Holden - Kim Novak version, or because Im not a Gen-Xer, but this was absolutely the worst remake I have ever seen. Without the originals soundtrack, it just seemed like another typical TV movieyes, about as bland as Kraft cheese.#0
3853_1#I think Jason Lee has huge potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star. The plot is awful, the comedy is awful. I laughed twice, I think for relief, because in retrospect, they were fairly lame jokes. I found myself scared for the future of Fletch, and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed, not Lee. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out, instead of this film. Save your time. 1 star.#0
7544_7#Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies like these, movies that ultimately end up on anime-fans hard-drives and college students floors, but get completely ignored by pretty much anybody outside of its country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed. Really, its just a beautifully detailed surrealist journey. --PolarisDiB#1
3935_9#The basic hook here is Lincoln Is Slow. It is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation, making him a Great Leader who is here engaged in single-handedly civilizing the American frontier through the grand instrument of Law. All that John Ford hooey and more, including one lurking slave and extraneous Death By Injun. However! The slow conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie-making, funny and moving at extremes. The history may be bunk, but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true-seeming moments. Check out Henry Fondas big introductory stroll across the deck, his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river, his dalliance with Mary Todd on the porch, and the priceless business that follows Maam, weve got to hurry  Things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama; but Fonda is priceless throughout.#1
7427_9#I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70s when I was barely 16 while viewing another film. Oh  how excited me and my best friend were. we couldnt wait for the month or so until it would come on. I saw this movie 17 times that year at the theatre. I love,love,love it. Kris is so perfect for the film. He is brash and kinda trashy but also shy and uncertain with Babs and it is so endearing to watch it again. When they sing evergreen at the studio and he chimes in with his raspy voice so very different from the perfect notes coming from her but I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and he is so proud.I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like est-her I even have the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she wore. this came on TV on time and I got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to. Maybe its just that I was so caught up into it at an age when everything was extreme dont know. The ending always has me in tears even today.#1
7914_2#This film was slated to be a blockbuster film, and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the movie delivers, perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man, but well enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects, the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. Very disappointing#0
7823_7#An overlong, but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other out, but the second half isnt as strong, due to the elimination of the Biko character. Still, its a compelling film with great performances by Kline and Washington, in the film that put the latter on the map. Washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time. Overall, a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit. 7/10. #1
5255_4#Visually speaking, this film is stunning. It has some delightful black comedic moments. But on the whole, the plot is very clich√©d, as is its seeming message. If youre a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw, youll love it. If youre looking for something at all high-brow, steer away. I saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it isnt disturbing. Just grinding and unpleasant to sit through. If you genuinely want to be challenged, go see something like The Lost. If you want to be grossed out, or tell your friends about a really messed up film, then this is for you.#0
10322_2#If youre looking to be either offended or amused or both, youll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really isnt even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clich√©s. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived mess. Unless youre obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really dont see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.#0
6867_9#I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80s and 90s. I watched the Groove Tube for the first time in 2001, when I was 19. So for anybody who thinks that something  dated  cant be quite funny 30 years later.think again! Its funny even if you have no idea what the 70s were like, and the thought of bell-bottom pants make you cringe. Who can argue with a Bozo the Clown type who reads adult literature? There is plenty to laugh at. The scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.#1

A pathetic father who fails at everything he tries e.g. fishing, hunting, in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies. His  visions  are not only ridiculous but in the process he lies to his son numerous times about various obvious things. Words cannot express how bad this film is. The children and wife are very real which makes the film even sadder. I dont get the humor unless you like laughing at other people making a fool of themselves. I dont get how this could have come up for awards. Save your bucks, its not worth the rental.#0
7450_3#I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.#0
9745_7#As someone else commented, this is a feel-good movie. Its got glorious scenery and the wonder-filled voice of Luciano! Ive seen this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon. Id forgotten how much I miss Pavarottis singing of Nessun Dorma and I need to get out the CD! Its a great movie to just while away the afternoon engrossed in fun and reverie. Eddie Albert is grand as the agent and a bit over the top, but all agents are just that anyway. The Italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view. If you need acting of Olivier proportion, this movie isnt for you. If you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music, watch this film. Just enjoy!#1
11798_10#Ive seen this film literally over 100 timesits absolutely jam-packed with entertainment  Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981)I never thought an actor could capture the  intensity  like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as Im concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jonesthis film captures his best performance #1
3821_9#Secret Sunshine (2007) is famous for its awards at the Festival de Cannes in 2007 and other film festivals. Jeon-Do Yeon, who played the newly widowed Shin-ae, won the best actress trophy at the 60th Cannes festival. Secret Sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and Jeon-Do Yeon received a best actress nod from Asia Pacific Screen Awards. In addition, this movie won the best film awards in virtually all Korean film festivals. Masterfully written and directed, and uniquely photographed, Secret Sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy. This film also talked about the forgiveness of God and people. Lee Chang Dong, director and writer of this movie, said in an interview,  In a vast sense, I wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense. Without love, we cant talk about hope and salvation.  Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent genre. This movie is not a movie about religion, but it drew attention from many Christians in Korea because there were a lot of Christian elements in the movie. Secret Sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in Korea. It is like Da Vinci Code. While Da Vinci Code helps us discuss the early church history, Secret Sunshine prompts us to deal with lifes messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable. With a shallow interpretation of the movie, people misunderstand Christianity and its theology. With a deeper interpretation, this movie will help us see beneath the surface. Some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched Secret Sunshine, and Lee Chang-dong responds by saying,  They were already anti-Christ before they watched this movie. Secret Sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through Shin-aes life.#1
10366_1#These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that. Then, reaching 70th minute I was convincing myself that its only a few more minutes, and I lasted to the very end which Im kinda proud of as I consider watching this movie as a great test for humans patience and crap tolerance. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try and if youre strong willed enough, you may even last to the end The movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all. All happenings in the movie, you can be sure you saw somewhere before, and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel.#0
3712_3#When I first heard about  Down To Earth,  I was pretty excited. Im a pretty big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rocks performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole. Rating 4/10#0
3186_8#I find this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easily digestible, the humour is light and clean, and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common, I find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out. Turns out to be very nice. The performance of the female lead is admirable; her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to Davids sophisticated role was very charming. I also find Veras dancing very, very well done. I find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly. For those who have had enough of profanity-filled movies of today, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly.#1
9266_9#Ah, the best and funniest movie about female football fans, only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage delusion set in North London (qv). By the way, I just watched this on Film 4 [2008-12-21] and am ruing my inability to set the PVR). Heres a list of my top favourite football movies 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. Those Glory Glory Days 4. A Shot at Glory 5. The Arsenal Stadium Mystery#1
9664_1#This Book-based movie is truly awful, and a big disappointment. Weve been waiting for this move over a month. Many film reviewer were hopeful for it. Also in newspapers and TV, it made big sense. When 29th April comes, many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful. Why? First of all story was so monotone. It has been many indefinite scenes, sometimes its hard to realize whats going on. The actresses, out of Hulya Avsar, werent harmonized with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She acts better in comedy films, In this movie, a kind of drama, she couldnt disposed of her previous role. And finally Movie is too short, just 66 minutes.#0
9782_4#This film had such promise  What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose its speed due to bad dialoge, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners. Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort.#0
7542_2#This movie is suppose to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes into the movie, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I cant imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blonde girl or when he  bear  punches that old lady. The lines, characters, and acting are all poorly done from the get-go. Ive always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made some terrible movies this year; this being by far the worst one (yet). I wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story-gripping thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original. However, if you intend on watching it, get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously; thats the only way you enjoy this film.#0
4928_3#This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. A wealthy upper class English woman schemes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind. Theres a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters. But naturally theres a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man. The wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that.#0
1260_10#The movie was a suspenseful, and somewhat dark, look at the severe results of a genuinely human mistake. Connery and Fishburne work very well together in this thriller about murder and redemption. Keep your boots on for the strange turnaround at the end of the movieyoud never expect it!#1
8564_7#I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of Romania. This tells something certainly about the value, or maybe about the lack of universality of the film, but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. The film is splendidly acted by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega-star, we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art. Although suffering from a hesitant story-telling and falling sometimes in non-essential details or character comics, the film is still an important landmark for the Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the Romanian society.#1
2417_1#This was without a doubt the worst thing I have ever spent money on. I feel dirty for admitting that I rented this movie and actually paid money to see it. This does not even rate trash. No no. This is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer. To call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere. It was so bad I felt I had to register at IMDb and warn my fellow man. This luvahire character claims this movie is great. One has to question his grasp on reality. Lets take some of his comments and analyze them. The potential renter whose interest has not been quelled, should find the following blurb on the back of the video case  The Quiroz Brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting. --Mr. Bangla#0
11244_10#One of my best films ever, maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many of hazels concerts, but the film was a good story line and very good acting by hazel and a up and coming Phil Daniels not sure about his latest project Eastenders   excellent performance by lots of unknown actors who if you keep your eyes peeled will see them in many of the UK soaps today exp Carver out of the Bill, the more i watch it the more of them i spot, well if you have not seen it yet have a night in with the video, dont forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head Mochanian style.Enjoy#1
6758_4#Quite possibly the nicest woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie gives another fine performance here. Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this film. ACTING $ (The acting is sub standard to say the least. Rochon is always a treat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character in American Nightmare was superior. Danny Wolske does a fine job as Debbies object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about).#0
3789_8#Bravo to Czechs, their once-powerful movie industry seems to awaken from post-Communist slumber. Conclusion dont miss this one! Its got a lot to offer.#1
1470_1#I was looking over our DVD tower last night for something to watch. We were between NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled one out that I never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it sounded like a rip-off of  The Big Chill  but, with the all-star cast, felt it might be worth watching. Boy was I wrong  Not only was it like  The Big Chill,  it was a rip-off almost character by character. The Bill Paxton character was a copy of William Hurt ( where have you been all this time  role) -spoiler warning- and, lo and behold, he remains behind to take care of the old place(cabin/camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found myself wondering why Im even watching these people. There was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them. How did  Unca Lou  even find these characters after 20 years? Plus it wasnt even funny, except when Perkins fell, err flopped out of bed the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife,  Were there any endearing characters in this film?  Are you sleeping over there?  She replied,  No, Im still thinkingNo, none I can think of.  #0
7078_9# Twelve Monkeys  is odd and disturbing, yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. It cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films. All in all,  Twelve Monkeys  is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from Willis and Pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot thats so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewers attention by making it interesting and witty. Its also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so its all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures Ive ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really, but thats how it is, its mind blowing.#1
12279_1#Although this seems to be quite an old show (2002), I watched my first ever episode last night and I have to say it has to be the worst show . . . ever. WORST TV SHOW . . . . . EVER.#0
2101_7#Forget Neo and Bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes. They only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes. Since they cannot be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick. I exited the theater room very pleased, and hungry for more.#1
9892_1#Why is it that any film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making? Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all, Julius Ceasar, and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors. Despite lavish sets and costumes, this movie is as bad as any Italian  sandals and toga  extravaganza of the 50s. Admittedly, this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen, which is why  Gladiator  went over well, but  Gladiator  did not have all the romance novel sex. Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Pity some of it didnt wash off on the others.#0
6017_2#the only enjoyable thing about this highly mockable movie is playing  guess  that location. What Toronto landmark will stand in for what American/international location. Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope they dont make another of this ilk! We dont gotta prayer.#0
12293_10#This is an excellent film, and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they dont stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure, and a feeling that all is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then do. I cant wait to see it again, and wish that it could be put on general release.#1
8470_8#A team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure ¬ñ the Crown of the Queen of Sheeba. From Egypt, the crown is to be transferred via steamship to San Francisco. But it wont be an easy journey. There are plenty of would-be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown. Fortunately for all involved, Mr. Moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey. However, that doesnt mean someone wont try to get their hands on the treasure. As much as I hate that the Mr. Moto series had to end after this installment, its understandable when you think about it. WWII was just around the corner. And after Pearl Harbor, a movie with a Japanese hero wouldnt have gone over very well. At least the Mr. Moto series ended on a very positive note.#1
6555_2#So the other night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it and I thought that had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately, it didnt. To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. By doing this you wont waste 90 minutes of your life, as I did.#0
9646_7#There is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship--one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. And there is also emotion in the inner-workings of Mathieus family dealing w/ his mothers problems--and how that comes to bear on their relationship. But the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless Im just too dumb to pick up on them). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the boys break-up? And the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first. It seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills, or some male nudity. But as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying.#1
11072_8#its all very simple. Jake goes to prison, and spends five years with the con and the chess masters. they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure, and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks. they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom from his innermost fears, from what he believes to be himself. for that, they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear, all the pride, all the hope - to be reborn as true master of his will. its a clever movie about the journey of illumination, about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.#1
2149_10#Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyamas transformation is incredibly believable. The score is so moving, it brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic. Mais graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps. Tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character. You can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing  The King and I . Aokis character is both hilarious and pitiful. Masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right. This film is truly a keeper.#1
12138_1#Serious HOME ALONE/KARATE KID knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot. You could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene. Oh, and the acting sucks too. Although I must say that the line  Sorry, dude, I have to take a major dump big time  made me laugh my ass off.#0
5066_1#This is the worst show. Buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing. Even Sesame Street has better humor and more adult than friends  Friends  may be the worst thing Ive ever seen on television and Ive been sitting in front of the tube observing Friends  simply does not stack up well to other, contemporary series. It lacks the smartness of  Seinfeld  and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of  Frasier . The characters in  Friends  seem designed to make them repellant dullards. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl. The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so. (It might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of  Friends .)#0
4869_10#Not for people without swift mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If You dont have any of these You can not understand it. And if you dont understand, you cant enjoy it. ) For example if you think Picasso is a name of a car produced by Citroen, probably if you see a Picassos painting you just will walk by it, deciding that its a trash-work of some street painter. ) So do not judge, before trying to understand it ) In the end i think its a MUST for every one with open minds. Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be put in frames. Because there are things in this world, that any frame just wont fit.#1
129_9#With stunning cinematography and a thread of Kafkaesque absurdity, this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene. The movie plays much like a dream, and I think that may be why people either hate it or love it. Characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless. But these are failings of the movie but conscious choices. The film works isnt trying to work as history, but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies.  I would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie, but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that I was completely swept away. This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever, and there is a wild imagination in its style. I can completely understand why people would hate it, but I give it 9/10.#1
3355_10#May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for historical appointment with Mussolini.Emotions , tensions and forms of self-affirmation. a empty town, a housewife and a journalist. The meeting of two different worlds. Refuge for a mother with a sad life. Short filling for a classical victim. A story about solitude and silence. About the form of of lifes nooks and desire like fights form. The great character- a book gifted in a springs afternoon. This movie is a poem, remarkable for the art to describe the shades of common loneliness. A pleading for a ineffable relation with reality. And with your interior world. The pictures of Il Duce, the clumsiness of Antonietta, the patience and the frailty tension of Gabriele, the art of director to give the sense of script grace two great actors makes this film sublime, foretaste of subtle delicacy, a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict, about essence of life and repulsiveness of any tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent acting. A clear masterpiece.#1
981_2#As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) watch this very, very dull picture. It is Miss Dietrichs first color film, and the worlds most beautiful blond is a redhead! Bad start. The story is a tremendous bore, involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff religious guilt. (Who needs it???) Suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all Dietrichs films (and I have seen most, including  Pittsburgh ) this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching. The color photography is OK (this is a very early Technicolor release), but to no purpose. Ridiculous casting C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough said?). The only thing of any interest at all is John Carradines outlandish caricature of a performance as  The Sand Diviner,  who foretells all that will happen. The supposed  happy ending  is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Yet another example of David O. Selznicks highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good film? -- other than That One?) And, for one final annoyance, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess, with volume levels seemingly randomized. Highly unrecommended.#0
6938_4#In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction on his invitation is rather weird. Is was supposed to be funny. I only like movies who really are funny. I suppose I will never watch this movie again.#0
5173_3#When I saw this at a shop I thought it looked really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek meets Texas chainsaw massacre, and I mean it only cost three quid (around $6). To be honest I dont think it was even worth that. Overall a pointless watch. It felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes. If you want an artsy film-dont bother. If you want a slasher movie- dont bother- The film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening.#0
9291_4#i cant believe that NONE of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes. Its as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesnt seem to condemn these assaults - as in, the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions, and neither does anyone else. One man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only with  you cannot force a woman to love you  rather than  you should never force a woman sexually, you jerk  From a womans point of view, the movie is a let down. It sort of  throws a bone  to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the movie is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter doesnt use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. She never even makes them apologize - rather, SHE seems apologetic. Overall, a depressing and upsetting movie, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as Hero by a long shot.#0
4103_7#The lead characters in this movie fall into two categories smart and stupid. Simple enough. I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment. The best Czech movies I have seen are 1) Peli¬öky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you have seen the absolute best of Czech cinema.#1
6485_10#The world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2.  #1
10311_3#SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas does his usual tough guy/pretty boy act, and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass kicking hot chick Alexa. OJ Simpson is a detective, coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona. Translation cable TV filler. There isnt enough skin to qualify this as a Guilty Pleasure. The script has some gaping holes. Best/Worst Moment In one jarring scene, OJs partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot, or words to that effect. This vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough; but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released, it is truly appalling, and therefore entertaining in an unintentional, horrible way. I was so startled that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose. Now THATS a Guilty Pleasure. BC#0
1047_8#It may (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason I really checked out this movie in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 role for the Best Actor Oscar. (I still would have given the Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) Well, Im glad I did check this movie out, because I enjoyed it immensely. I think the movie did preach a little, but not only did I not mind, I enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them. 9/10#1
10589_10#I enjoyed Longstreet, which followed in the steps of Raymond Burrs successful Ironside TV series and was intended to give it competition. But this show was canceled after one season because it was decided--I believe wrongly--that Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr. Burrs Ironside. Writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on TV.#1
3880_8#Well, for starters, this actually was THE most elegant Clausen film to this date.  Id have to say its one of the best movies Ive seen this year and Im greatly anticipating his next.#1
2709_8#To finally see what many consider to be the greatest women-in-prison film of all time, I felt like I had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds. Boy, it sure contained the elements I expected, and delivered so much more. A constant Im discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold, tolerance, and resolve(..not to mention sanity)being tested by their superiors. While most of them were hired for the way they look naked, because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements, something else emerges, other attributes, such as attitude and guts, that I ultimately respond to. I was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time Demme collaborator, cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison, cells and rooms, not an easy task. The prison is appropriately crummy and the girls, despite being quite attractive, look the part of desperate inmates longing, yearning from the very pits of their souls, to escape such horrid entrapment. Steele is superb as the warden, understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far, candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint..notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge. Cales bluesy score is incredibly depressing, while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still fun-and-games..I think Cales score mirrors Demmes handling of the material. Cale and Demmes partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad, isolating, oppressive place, while, almost simultaneously, showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast. My favorite scene happens outside the prison, as two of our girls(..joining forces with a third)interrupt a bank robbery already in progress..the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob! As you might expect, you get naked women in showers, prisoner in solitary, a cat fight, shootouts, attempted escapes which go awry, and other exploitative elements(..such as a horrifying shock therapy session, not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of Belle). Interesting enough, Demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension, understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making.#1
13_7#The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) locale and lush John Williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item. Unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star  decent  flick, mostly memorable for what it tried to dobring an art house style film mainstream. The small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself, and if well done, will satisfy most grownups. Jane Fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable. I wondered why she wasnt doing a post doctorate at Yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in Waterbury. Robert DiNiros character was just a bit too contrived. An illiterate, nice guy loser who turns out to actually be, with a little help from Janes character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. Ill give it an  A  for effort.#1
10640_8#This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Dolph Lundgren, however Alex Karzis is awful as the villain!. The story is very good, and i found the kids to be likable for the most part, plus Dolph Lundgren is simply amazing in this!. The action scenes are excellent, and its almost like Die Hard except its set in a school!, plus Kata Dob√≥ is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick!. The finale is very exciting, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, however i just wished it had another villain, because Alex Karzis just didnt cut it as the villain way too OTT, and laughable for my tastes. This should be higher then 4.1 in my opinion, as i thought it was a great action film, and while the kids, were very stupid at times, they got quite resourceful as the movie went along!, plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well!. The ending is very amusing,and Corey Seviers character was my favorite student!, plus Dolph has still got it!. This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Lundgren!, but Alex Karzis is awful as the villain, still i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Sidney J. Furie does a very good job here with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. There is a bit of blood and violence. We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,knife in the side of the head, bloody arrow hits, an impaling, and other minor stuff. The Acting is fantastic!. Dolph Lundgren is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, kicks that ass as usual, had great chemistry with the kids, had an awesome character, is very charismatic, and he may not have shown a great emotional rage, he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch!, he is one of my favorite actors! (Lundgren Rules ). Alex Karzis is god awful as the villain, he is laughably OTT, was boring, and not menacing at all, he also annoyed the crap out of me. Kata Dob√≥ is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do, she was the real villain in my opinion!. Corey Sevier is funny as Mick, he was my favorite student, and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half, i liked him a lot!, he had good chemistry with Dolph too. Dov Tiefenbach(Willy),Chris Collins(Hogie),Mpho Koaho(Jay Tee),Danielle Hampton(Alicia),Nicole Dicker(Charlee) all do great as the students. Jennifer Baxter is very cute and is good as The fianc√©e. rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!.    1/2 out of 5#1
7596_3#A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity. Her question  Not even Colin Farrell could save it?  My response  Not even Colin Farrells ass could save it.  #0
8917_2#The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzches work and personality, psychoanalytical techniques and Viennas history. Take a well-know genius you have not read, describe him as demented, include crazy physicians to cure him, a couple of somewhat good looking women, have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache, have every character speak with the strongest accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one (Freud), mention a few words used in the genius works, overdo everything you can, particularly music, and you are done. Audience, please stay away.#0
7616_1#The good news is a movie was made, drawing on a supposed Aztec myth and featuring an unusually Aztec-American (is such a word exists) cast. The bad news is, it was dead at birth. I paid $3.45 to rent this. I could have better spent it on a hamburger!#0

3550_1#I run a group to stop comedian exploitation and I just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for,  Last Comic Standing.  If they dont have a GOOD agent, then they dont even get a chance to audition so more than 80% of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent! If they do make it to an audition, I was told that its  pre-determined  if they get a second chance. So what the TV audience sees is NOT the best comics in the US. Please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized http www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y#0
8645_1#I just got back from this free screening, and this  Osama Witch Project  is the hands-down worst film Ive seen this year, worse than even  Catwoman  - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction. Around  Tape 4,  I began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.#0
1612_10#This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It is virtually flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivating and delightful! None quite equals Moonstruck #1
10273_8#Im a big fan of films where people get conned, and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of the films where people get conned genre. In short, its an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels, and never truly revealing whats happening, while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what youve just seen. The film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; its still difficult to guess where its going, and every twist comes off as a surprise. As mentioned, Im a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler. She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con. House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his films setting in the underground levels of the city. The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill. Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, hes always solid and believable as the villain of the piece. Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role. She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. The way that the film executes its plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. At times its almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film. Another thing thats great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if youre interested in making twenty bucks, say. All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride.#1
1882_1#What an appalling piece of rubbish  Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is? Yes, its  arty ; and yes, its  foreign , but . thats not enough. The plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show but not so slickly made. And oh yes if I had neighbours like these, Id move #0
3518_10#Drum scene is wild! Cook, Jr. is unsung hero of this and many movies. Fantastic actor, great flick. A few twists that keep you moving. A must-see.#1
10188_2#This juvenile, bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens bodies, desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years. How ? By burning up gas and equating a fast, reckless car (or plane) with freedom. Even die-hard car-film and SF fans should avoid this film like month-old roadkill, unless you enjoy heckling Exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the heros gas tank.#0
5099_1#This incredibly overrated anime television series (26 episodes, 25 minutes each) is about a 14-year-old boy (and two of his girl classmates) who pilots a giant robot to defend Japan against invading beings called Angels. There is very little explanation given to the Angels or why their numbers have increased in recent times, and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason (why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans youre attempting to destroy?). The robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles, but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch. Almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occurs.  Evangelion  represents everything anime should NOT be - massive quantities of dull, pretentious tripe under the guise of intelligent cinema. The universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable; and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as  one of mankinds greatest achievements  is probably the most stupifying comment Ive ever heard on IMDb - and Ive seen some doozies.#0
8525_2#Oh, man! This thing scared the heck out of me when I first watched it and I was SIXTEEN  That creepy animated Barbie is scary as hell! I want to stop talking about her now.#0
9822_10#I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years. Its not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, its about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most important. Its not a sin to have a child when youre a teenager and still in high school, and its not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this great movie, and if they did, they clearly didnt get the message behind it all. Its about not taking chances when youre in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. Its not a myth. You dont necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first. This movie has a clear message behind it JUST SAY NO!#1
5001_1#I dont know why Im commenting this stupid reality-show I happened to watch a few episodes of(a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something,I didnt watch the entire thing though.Only like three episodes)as I was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day.Maybe Im just bored today-) I feel sorry for Britney,I really do.For all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity.Or shes self-centered to the extreme.She married the nitwit Federline(okay anybody can make a mistake) and before that she  starred  this horrible show about her everyday life with him,where she shoves a camcorder wherever she feels like it,no matter if it is in someones face or into the shower as Federline is standing in there. Shes babbling about her sex-life without leaving anything to your imagination,I dont care for my part,but I cant help wondering how she feels about it now when shes divorced.And yes,for her sake Im embarrassed.But I shouldnt be.She seem to live a pretty empty,shallow life though.I dont want to swap lives with her even if I could. Road-kill TV if you like.#0
4382_8#Overshadowed by  Braveheart  released the same year, the two costume dramas beg comparison. I admit my bias against Mel Gibson, yet I maintain a rational preference for  Rob Roy.  Both  Braveheart  and  Rob Roy  compellingly depict Scots history in bloody, romantic fashion.  Braveheart  is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. Its also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Note its cornball usage of slow motion filming. Its violence is both ugly and glorious. It is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset. While  Braveheart  surpasses  Rob Roy  in sheer levels of carnage (not to mention its indulgent running time), the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. Its action is more understated, yet more surprising and clever. Its sex is less showy, yet more erotic.  Rob Roy  also has a better realized romantic interest. Its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period. Its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended  The Last of the Mohicans  and  The Patriot.  You may find the latter more akin to  Braveheart  with its emphasis on blood lust, with the former more similar to  Rob Roy  in tone. All the of the aforementioned movies merit their R ratings for violence.#1
4191_1#I have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to. This movie made me angrier and angrier as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. Now, after Ive seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when youre watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters ( The highway belongs to meME! ), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the  plot , but still youll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy who isnt wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road. Blech.#0
10040_10#For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Roses and Jacks story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart wont go on from this one.#1
12054_10#I first saw this movie here in the U.K. in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it. I still have the video tape, although worn out (over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been chilled by it!).  I have seen some comments on the movie which say its not this and not thatI think those people get scared by Friday 13th and the like, stalk and slash rammel, which are laughable. This is a traditional ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effectsno swearing, no blood, no gratuitous sex scenes, no chainsaws or guns etcSo how refreshing  Its atmospheric. IF you like chilling horror, well written, well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; only last night I saw the original Haunting and that is a superb movie. Very atmospheric again - and so is The Woman In Black. The end of the movie differs to the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try ityou  will  like it if you like traditional ghost storiesSOturn off the lights, turn up the fire, lock the doors, grab a drinkand enjoy )#1
11162_4#Jack Black is an annoying character.This is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds.Do I have to write eight more lines?Ana de la Reguera is dang fine to look at,as a Mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of Jack Black.This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie film.I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture.This movie explores Mexican culture-deeply. I just choke on its cultural rudenessJack Black is just so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary into Mexican culture, as it were.Mexican Wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy, such as myself could seek.I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black has presented here. I think IMDb changed my review.Has anyone else had his review changed as well?Just a question.#0
8_7#Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.#1
838_9#   1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. A well formulated story and film all together, Brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his  Bond  movies. After 2004s  After the sunset  his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time. Professional hit-man, so to speak, Julian Noble on a job in Mexico City winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly one of his best roles) also on business there. The two on-screen duo produce a comically charged, laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs. Davis in one of her best roles since  American Splendor  gives another charming and witty performance. One of the years most enjoyable and best films. My final rating 9/10#1
4332_10#Paul Reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It is worthy of an Academy Award. This was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year. Reisers wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running TV sitcom  Mad about You . Peter Falk did a masterful job as his dad, and Peter who is now 78 years young made us laugh and cry at the same time. The supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. It is a must see movie for 2005. We bet that everyone across all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie. We have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different.#1
7763_8#One thing about Hollywood, someone has a success and its always rushed to be copied. And another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio. If you like splashy technicolor Fifties soap opera than this is the film for you.#1
3917_4# The house of the spirits  is quite awful. I live in South America, in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe, and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality, this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid. Things are not so simple and linear as appears here, and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in  The house . If you cant show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all. There are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema, without so many commonplaces. In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your publics intelligence.#0
12296_8#Fragile Carne, just before his great period. Although it is sometimes hesitantly directed, and marred by longueurs, HOTEL DU NORD is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of French films of the late 1930s, as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director. All of his great virtues are here the cramped interiors broken up by gliding, complex, delicious camera movements; a melancholy deployment of light and shade; remarkable, wistful sets by Alexander Trauner, which are so evocative that they, as the title suggests, take on a shaping personality of their own; the quietly mournful music of Maurice Jaubert; a seemingly casual plot about romance, tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time, in this case Louis Jouvet and Arletty. The films principle motif is that of water - the credits float and dissolve, the hotel stands by a waterway - but instead of Renoirs open river of possibility, we have a canal, stagnant and manmade, going nowhere. The film begins as it ends, and the setting never changes, except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return. Characters can only escape through death - their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy, the walls and frames that hold them captive, the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve. Any hope at the end, therefore, is profoundly, if romantically, compromised.#1
8311_9#I really liked this movie, it was good, and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many other classic singers, is very good at his job, when you see him in a musical movie, you know that it is going to be good! I would suggest that people watch this heart warming, sad, and special movie, if they want to know more about Richard! Outstanding! Fresh!#1
6320_10#The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it. But this movie caught me off guard. It wasnt what I was expecting at all. Its been a while since Ive seen it but I do remember I could not stop laughing  And it wasnt just the cast that did it for me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you were expecting something to happen it didnt happen. There were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious. The cinematography, along with the set, was absolutely beautiful as well. I really cant say anything bad about this movie! Expcept, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more screen time!#1
7343_2#Ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? Or any taiwanese movie? Propably for a reason. This one was a really boring one, even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels. Pretty much nothing good about this movie; a single character that wasnt completely bland and a few OK black magic spells, like the eel one. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect didnt work at all, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (not that scary really). This is the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen.#0
3770_10#When will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world? If you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching  Bill and Teds bogus journey.  This is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch, Keanu and Alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from  Bill and Teds excellent adventure  with even more style then they had in 1st movie. Its not rocket science but its great for a laugh, the characters being extremely like-able and the story-line being so radical you have to laugh. Dont expect deep-and-meaningfulls just expect pure fun #1
11208_8#Oh, where are you going, my little one, little one Turn around, turn around, turn around and againyoure wondering how much has really changed in 50 years.#1
2653_10#Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen Kings book titled the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasnt good and didnt want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but dont know when and how. Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later on, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are  intruders  in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things Ive ever seen happen here. The ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute.#1
8478_1#This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever. The acting was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any upset emotions. At the beginning of the movie, she was supposed to be discouraged. Instead, she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out. She sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene. I was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to pluck out her. Everyone else was suffering from over-acting as well. It was flat out annoying. It was also an insult to figure skaters. Jordan took a month to train, and they cast her as a person who makes the Olympic team. Its practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work. A pitiful excuse for a movie, and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating. Dont waste your life. It doesnt even deserve one star.#0
11352_1#this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities Maybe it held some fascination in the 3D dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while. Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up well, I agree with an above review - this is like a cold-war propaganda story. Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. BTW - why were all the main character flies deformed? - not one had the full compliment of limbs!#0
7635_10#I have seen this movie plenty of times and I gotta tell ya, Ive enjoyed it every single time. This is Belushis pinnacle movie in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you cant help but get involved once you start watching. The movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some already were big, and others were just getting started. Its billed as a feel good movie, and thats exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life isnt always so bad after all. Sometimes youve just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When youre done watching, youll appreciate the things you have a lot more and youll also be smiling. You cant ask for much more from a movie in my opinion, not to mention its a hilarious movie and youll never lose interest. Very Very underrated movie here folks. Rating from me 10 I am out #1
11148_4#This is the prime example of low budget, winning over what would be a good story line. Lets bring back Samaire Armstrong (having seen her work on the O.C. I know she can do better), then find a better script and budget. Bring in a better script and direction, and Id come back again.#0
8244_1#I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly its been made and simply is. Its one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). My advise Dont watch this under ANY circumstances.#0
9968_4#As an ex-teacher(!) I must confess to cringing through many scenes - though I continued to watch to the end. I wonder why?! (Boredom, perhaps?) -) #0
9472_1#There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so lets get that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was well, just awful. Call the SPCA. This Cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again. Please, please, no sequel.#0
5279_1#My friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end. It was just so boring and unoriginal. Not even the  hot  girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching. Everything was just predicable and annoying. Overall this movie can only be watched if by your self, to save any abuse from your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.#0
8407_7#this is, above all else, the typical Crown International Pictures drive-in (read  passion pit ) programmer. The 1975 Sammy Johns hit record  Chevy Van  is heard repeatedly on the soundtrack (this movie has even been reissued with the title CHEVY VAN), despite the films title vehicle being a Dodge. Danny DeVito makes only six minutes of on-screen appearance, but countless VHS reissues falsely credit him as the star of the flick. The movie is a comparatively sexist morality tale -- will Bobby find sexual satisfaction through the one-night-stand his customised van facilitates, or must he wait until Tina, the girl of his dreams, gives him the time of day? Still, it is representative of the prevailing carnal dream of male American high schoolers of the time, and on that basis alone THE VAN has, almost in spite of itself, become an artifact of the period that must be referenced in any honest retrospective of the periods popular American cinema#1
3836_2#As one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film, I found this to be a very disappointing movie. Not many films leave me feeling cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.#0
9131_3#I can hardly believe I watched this again last night after more than 25 years As I said, a shame and a real waste of all that talent, including that of Peter Sellers (who played both Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (whod been in a Chris Lee Fu film in his time), Helen Mirren (the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half-hour of the film!). I begin to wonder if anyone will EVER make a  proper  Fu Manchu film, or if fans will have to settle for Karloffs being almost the ONLY one?#0
5216_8#Erroll works for The Department of Public Safety and his job is to check up on sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex offenders. I dont blame him but his boss is ready for him to retire so along comes Allison. Erroll is now training her to do his job and its like job shadowing. Allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she doesnt realize how much danger she really is and its all Errolls fault. He starts to go to far with his obsession of finding a missing girl when his job isnt to be a police officer. Its a fairly decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works outside his  scope of practice.  Erroll did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of Allison. It has some good mystery to it too and just when I had it figured out, there was more to it.#1
126_1# I Am Curious Yellow  is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesnt matter what ones political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isnt true. Ive seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they dont exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which were treated to the site of Vincent Gallos throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying)  double-standard  in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally wont see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of womens bodies.#0
7660_1#0 s Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. Based on the video game director Uwe Boll attempts to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly he doesnt succeed. Instead he makes one of the worst movies ever MADE! Even though he gets minor celebrity such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line, and some basic relativity of whats going on in the dark and the light. The movie bounces all around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used on making the monsters. Even though they did look cool and the feedings were well, a little lame. Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating 0/10.#0
7345_1#I absolutely hate this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage?? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure Im well out of the room before it comes on. Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago??? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.#0
8238_1#This film was positively the worst film I have ever watched. I couldnt sit through the whole thing. I also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping I mean what was that all about! I cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have ingwasted a ¬£4 rental fee. The quality both picture and sound are terrible, the acting well doesnt exist . It was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh. AVOID AT ALL COST! The girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos theyd be willing to take their tops off While these girls have nice bodies it certainly didnt make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears. Definatey not one to buy folks. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money like I have.#0
6205_8#Convoluted, infuriating and implausible, Fay Grim is hard to sit through but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. Shes at once touching,funny, cunning. The supporting actors commit to it as well. Fay Grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something that isnt cookie-cutter. In the end, it offers something that defies description.#1
9336_9#German private TV is ill-renowned for copying Dutch and ¬ñ naturally ¬ñ US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics Screwball. In short Watch it. I dont have the foggiest what the English synchronisation is like, but hey, its worth learning German just to watch them four seasons. Pseudo-happy end included.#1
6407_1#I watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. Thats a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously though, this film is living proof that formula works. If it aint broke, it dont need fixin. A streetwise-yet-vulnerable heroine, a hardened ex-cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with issues. Pure magic.#0
5461_7#Escaping the life of being pimped by her father(..and the speakeasy waitressing)who dies in an explosion, Lily Powers(Barbara Stanwyck, who is simply ravishing)sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city Gotham. When a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law(and Lilys new lover), the skys the limit for Lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesnt come into her hands. Newly appointed president to the bank, Courtland Trenholm(George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of forking over lots of dough, but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the City of Love. This makes Lilys mouth water as now shell have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way. Though, circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches..Trenholm, now her husband, is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank. He needs money Lily now has in her possession or hell have absolutely nothing. Stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual Warner Brothers polish. Being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy. Good direction from Alfred E Green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of Stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act. Obviously the film shows that money isnt everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of Lilys dead heart. That ending having Lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didnt ring true to me. Shes spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him.#1
5437_4#Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends. The year is 1983, and young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely opposed to his fathers lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography, the whole film feels like the director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was funny if outright commercial - is desperately seeking indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films but sprinkling it with stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many of the star-laden premieres at Sundance this year it felt like this was a secrety studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points - it failed in that respect and as a film in its own right.#0
10638_8#When I think about this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, thats how I think this movie should be judged in terms of. See the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace, or the sweltering turkish bath, and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice, coarse cloth, smooth skin, scented oils, flickering flames, satin rustle. Dont just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you.#1
10157_10#This is an entertaining look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course) who sings a lot and narrates a bit also. If you like Johnny Cash, this film is quite enjoyable. Also note the blonde depiction of Jesus in this workjust for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blonde hair? Anyway, its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all.#1
9553_9#I agree with the other comments. I saw this movie years ago. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as a dandy. The ribaldry is unsurpassed. If this comes out on video, I will definitely buy it.#1
8678_4#After watching  The Bodyguard  last night, I felt compelled to write a review of it. Rating 4 out of 10#0
7617_3#It is one of the worst movies ive ever seen, but Hostel is definitely much more worse. This movie is more funny and ridiculous, than scary. I laughed most of the time when watched it. Low quality effects (when you gonna watch it, youll understand what im talking about and HOW LOW quality is that), bad actors (i hear of them for the first time), and it seems like its shot by an amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a TV show, than a movie). But at least ive had the patience to watch it till the end. Like comedies? Watch it. Wanna horror? Go watch Ju-On The Grudge or some other good horror movie. I rate it 3 out of 10#0
917_10#I watched this in July and even with the Christmas theme, found it touching and sensitive. It is not for someone with a reality-mind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes dont make sense. William Russ did a grand job as Hank. I have only seen him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer where he played a weak character. But in this one, the expression in his eyes throughout, as Hank considered the things that were happening to him, was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one where Hank realizes who Max really was in his life. Its not for everyone..especially those who arent into feel-good movies and this is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this one. But I think it is well-worth re-watching, which is why I taped it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs. )#1
7975_8#I just love Malles documentaries. They are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It is about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you just cant help but also to fall in love with them too.  Unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened.#1
5395_10#I remember watching this film, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next. I was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a school yard. . Two friends are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A  Lets not go to class today.  And Kid A declines, claiming they could miss something really important. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. When he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid wont share, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important, it could help you for a life time.#1
1054_8#If you want mindless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle, then this is the show for you! In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for, but if youre looking for hard hitting, award-winning drama, go watch  The West Wing  or something.#1
2112_9#In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with co-worker James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two dont get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal. Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying.            The Shop Around the Corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut#1
2344_9#Im one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid. The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying. All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that Ive seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.#1
9344_1#As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists. Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth.#0
3883_10#Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I sure am glad that I have now! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then Eddie. I could not stop laughing for the entire show. If you like to laugh you HAVE to see this special!#1
7849_9#This short is a puzzlement. Words fail me here, as this is almost indescribable, Technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing), this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or  normal-because it most certainly is not either. This be an odd one, gang. Well worth checking out, but if things like Ren and Stimpy make your head hurt, you may want to skip this. Recommended.#1
11649_10#What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hrs to kill, watch it, you wont regret it, its too much fun! Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isnt anything more other than him, I still liked it. The music by A.R.Rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times, you really start liking it.#1
9043_3#I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son. He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and I did. The writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention at all. The movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that I was hoping my son would fall asleep so I could pick him up and walk out. Not to say that the film isnt an interesting concept, its just told so oddly, (bad screenplay?) especially when we  meet the family  for the first time. I know were supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord, they couldve shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, I didnt actually time it). By that point I was scratching my head looking for an exit.#0
11755_3#this is a great movie. I love the series on tv and so I loved the movie. One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold  that was great. i loved it it was pretty funny too. Its a great movie! Doy #0
3213_1#Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time that I experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it. The entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course. The story line was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was out the window, and the animation was done by four-year olds. Does that cover it? I have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life. I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews I am not off base with my observation. Grade   out of      #0
11441_10#As a person who sought out an existence as a professional person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic. My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.#1

5919_9#Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you just watch for fun. It is not a comfortable experience, although it does have some laugh-out-loud moments. This is a movie you watch when you need food for thought. If youre the sort of person whos willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices American culture still holds, and if youre not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye, this movie may be for you.#1
6066_2#I was looking forward to seeing John Carpenters episode in Season 2 because his first, Cigarette Burns, was by far the best from Season 1 (and I did like other episodes from that season). Oh, how I was disappointed. Ill also take this opportunity to note that the show title, Masters of Horror, is a bad title to have. There simply arent many actual  masters of horror  around. Maybe two or three. If the show were called  Tale of Horror  or something like that it would be fine. But as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes, and therefore being criticized for not being a  master of horror  is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career. And it didnt even have to be a good one.#0
3454_8#First off, Im not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact Im not even a huge Justin fan, but I did like this movie. overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. I dont know why it didnt appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage Ive seen on the big screen. I would say its worth seeing.#1
6029_7#There arent too many times when I see a film and go,  huh, what? , but this was one of them. Maybe after seeing Zabriskie Point I felt much the same way Woody Allen felt after seeing 2001- he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period, realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on. Michelangelo Antonioni, in one of his few tries at making films inside of the US (after Red Desert, he did Blow-Up, this film, China, and The Passenger, all filmed outside his native Italy), I could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium. The results show that he doesnt lack the means to present images, feelings, tones, colors, sounds, and a visual representation of this era.  A directors job is to see , Antonioni once stated. Whatever that means, he doesnt disappoint for the admirer of his post-fifties work (I say post-fifties since Ive yet to see any of his films from before LAvventura). The deserts, skies, city, and even the faces in close-ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame, bringing us in. The soundtrack is equally compelling, with a master stroke including a sweet Rolling Stones song at one point, and then a crushing, surreal Pink Floyd song (re-titled from Careful with that Axe Eugene, one of their best pre-Dark Side) in the explosion sequence. If only the performances werent so one-sided I might find this to be on par with Blow-Up or The Eclipse. Its an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand, and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie/radical movement of the late 60s. But hey, what may be boring for an American such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the US, such as say, Italy. And it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing.#1
1534_1#From the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes Keanu  Im so wooden I could be a Plank me  Reeves look like an Oscar winner this film bites (pun not intended). The best thing about it is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment (which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and twist). Wish Id spent the ¬£3.99 it cost me on something else, like erm. Natural Born Killers Directors Cut. If you do buy this, youre really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague. If youre looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead. However if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, RomasantaThe werewolf Hunt.#0
10210_3#Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now only seems to do  by the numbers  Hollywood thrillers. Watch any episode of CSI instead. Its to the point and far more exciting.#0
7005_4#What if Somerset Maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club? If he had, he could have called it The Razors Edge, since the Katha-Upanishad tells us,  The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard.  But Maugham decided to stick with the well-bred class, and so we have Darryl F. Zanucks version of Larry Darrell, recently returned from WWI, carefully groomed, well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner.  Maugham, lest we forget, was a fine writer of plays, novels, essays and short stories. To see how the movies could do him justice, watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore, Trio and Quartet. And instead of wasting time with Larry Darrell, spend some time with Lawrence Durrell. The Alexandria Quartet is a good read.#0
2501_1#I saw this on TV the other night¬Ö or rather I flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when I couldnt stand watching it any longer. It was bad. Really, really bad. Not  so bad its good  just flat out bad. How did it get funded? Who thought this was a good idea? An actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasnt good enough to play a bad guy but I think what they meant was  save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of @$%.  I bet the rest of the cast had been given the option. To be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake American ascents. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was awkward and stilted. The dialog was inane. By far the saddest thing was ship. In real life the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesnt scrub up well. Instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls, I kid you not, they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. Dont watch this movie, not even as a joke.#0
6705_10#And its not because since her days on  Clarissa Explains It All  that Ive had a bit of a crush on Melissa Joan Hart, who at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s, but was still able to get teenage roles.  Sabrina, the Teenage Witch  was Harts next big leap after her  Clarissa  days. Based on the comic strip, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life. She is aided in her endeavors by her two aunts and a wise-cracking black cat as she goes from high school, to college, and finally to her career in journalism. 10/10#1
7774_7# Written on the Wind  was an enormously successful Universal picture. It could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama nymphomania, a large oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a mild touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre, mainly,  Dallas  and  Dynasty , just to mention two. Together with his other Hollywood movies,  Written on the Wind  shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen#1
4036_7#Good luck finding this film to even watch - its not yet released on tape or DVD. I saw on release in the early 70s, was lucky enough to catch it via American Cinematheques preservation efforts, and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years. It gets a  7  based on Karen Black. Youll see why.#1
7800_1#Beyond dirt cheap, this shot-on-video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through. Its got the typical gore that youd expect in a zombie movie, but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while. Whats strange is that this is an amateur German video, and the version I saw is English-dubbed! The dubbers seem to be American fans (penpals of the Germans?!) who cant decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy. One character (a white German, of course) is dubbed by a black guy apparently, who speaks with thick ebonics! Kno wahm sayin, Comrad?#0
2666_10#Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. Its better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, its better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, its better), I dont care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.  Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesnt suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the mens room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? Its one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, thats just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubricks movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.#1

9355_7#Time and time again, it seems that the comedic actors of Hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers first it was Robin Williams {One Hour Photo (2002)}, then it was Jim Carrey {Eternal Sunshine¬Ö (2004) being one example}, then Will Ferrell {Stranger than Fiction (2006)} and now Adam Sandler. Yes, thats absolutely right the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless, goofball comedies {Im not complaining; Ive always been a fan} has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud. Of course, some readers may be wondering whatever happened to Punch-Drunk Love (2002), but I can only assure you that its a film Im currently taking measures to see as soon as possible, since Ive heard its terrific. My first film from director Mike Binder, Reign Over Me, is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship. Though it does occasionally stray into all-too-familiar territory, the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving, with both Sandler and Don Cheadle giving memorable performances. Initially, it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the September 11 attacks as a storytelling device. Afterall, wouldnt it be just as devastating if Charlies family had died in an ordinary, everyday car accident? However, if you consider that the directors intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy, then Reign Over Me does a very good job. Its easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks; this is the first 9/11-orientated film Ive seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who werent even involved, whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved. Adam Sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role, one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task. Snapping instantly between cheerfulness, anger and depression, Charlie Fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise, a hollow soul who, thanks to the companionship of an old friend, can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark, bleak tunnel.#1
3365_1#This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her. Nell then looks across at Theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor. It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened. And can anybody explain what Nells final words mean -  Its about family. Its always been about family ? Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard.#0
7243_10#A brilliant Russian √©migr√© devises the ¬ëStanislavsky system for winning at contract bridge - which makes him and his beautiful wife the GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America. The film takes advantage of the fad for contract bridge which had swept across the country since its development in the 1920s. It expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and makes no attempt to explain anything to the uninformed.#1
747_10#Although I was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school (1996) when I saw it I became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them. Now at the age of 27 I recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth (though none of my friends died). I think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up.#1
10173_8#RUMORS is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring  Private Snafu.  The films were aimed at servicemen and were directed, animated and scored by some of the top talent from Warner Bros. Termite Terrace, including Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, and Carl Stalling. The invaluable Mel Blanc supplied the voice for Snafu, and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by Theodor Geisel, i.e. Dr. Seuss. The idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery, using the character of Snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope, the little twerp who would do everything youre NOT supposed to do. According to Chuck Jones the scripts had to be approved by Pentagon officials, but Army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes, certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow-- all for the greater good, of course. This is a highly effective piece of work. The filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy, and the message is still a valid one. In recent years weve seen that catastrophic events (real or imagined) can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances. Because the technology has improved, the Private Snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e-mail, cellphones and blogging. Consequently, RUMORS is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesnt feel at all dated; in fact it may be more timely than ever.#1

This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores. Women are going to love it for all the wake-up romance advice for men, and men will love it for its spot-on father/son character study--one great little scene after another. And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what its like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most fun part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falks special craft. Really delightful. Lets hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and folks.#1
5049_3#A group of us watched this film are were really disgusted. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo wasnt on (its not like the writers/producers could do anything about that). The writing was poor, the script was sub-par. What REALLY annoyed us 1. When the two guys realized they were both dating Natalie, they didnt just leave they put up with that stupid (and ultimately degrading) contest - but only because they were macho competing guys, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy, its as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film). 3. Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.#0
11692_1#This movie was absolutely terrible. I cant believe I paid to see it in the theatre. I wouldnt watch it on free cable t.v. Im surprised that Joe Magtena even made it. Do not waste your time with this movie.#0
11341_4#In a way this is the disaster Fellini has been working towards all his life. The line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small, and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings. That said,  Casanova  left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by Bukowski  Yet, there might just be a point in portraying Casanova as an unsightly fool. And I challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini couldnt. More than ever he seems here like a dirty old man - a maestro, for sure, but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else. I find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film. It was a story not worth telling.#0
5548_4#Though the title includes the word  zombies , this film is not what youd expect from a movie made today, though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected. Dean Jagger portrays Armand Louque, an officer in the French Army of World War I, who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons, or  zombies , who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war, though on whose side is not certain. At first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon, but eventually French General Duval (George Cleveland) orders a non military expedition into the ancient Cambodian city of Angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it. Not to be too harsh on the film, it plays out decently within the parameters of its story outline, but if youre thinking  zombies   within the traditional context, youll probably be disappointed. If you want to sample an early treatment of the subject, the aforementioned  White Zombie  with Bela Lugosi is the way to go.#0
7674_10#I had the privilege of watching  Holly  at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12 yr old Vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) comes into Hollys life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately searches for her. We follow theyre difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunion. Holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day. The movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line. I walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can I help? This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore.#1
4471_8#Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Iturbi star in  Anchors Aweigh,  directed by George Sidney. Wonderful movie, very buoyant.#1
11525_8#This movie is awesome for three main reasons. It is esthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved that. There is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets. A photography which looks very costly (and probably was not) completes the look . I always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits/loners coming together and becoming a family . Sometimes they fall into clich√©s but this one does not. This group of actors really portrays well flawed, yet extremely likable characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him , the van and the road movie theme, I could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year Little Miss Sunshine¬Ö) . I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio , very interesting actor, and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by Til Schweiger performance at times . The opening scene, all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny. There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film. I like the end a lot. And of course it is all about the Magician theme . A good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to, to create an illusion. Which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and thats why they call it movie magic.#1
5829_3#I watched this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibit. It certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the exhibit and, in retrospect, probably should have. Bottom line unless you really get off on Barneys sense of art, dont bother seeing this movie. The message is obscure, the pace slow, and the cultural references pretentious. If youre after shock-art, youll do better at one of the many  Undead  movies or hunting down an old copy of Hustler and taking in a fecal-cartoon.#0
1013_9#Stargate SG-1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate. In the Stargate universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goauld such as Ra and Apophis. For millennia, the Goauld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures. As a result, Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs, Mayans, Britons, the Norse, Mongols, Greeks, and Romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy. Many well-known mythical locations such as Avalon, Camelot, and Atlantis are found, or have at one time existed. The parasitic Goauld use advanced technology to cast themselves as Egyptian Gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. Throughout the first eight seasons, the Goauld are the primary antagonists. They are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. The original arch-enemy from this race was the System Lord Apophis (Peter Williams). Other System Lords, such as Baal and Anubis, play pivotal roles in the later seasons. In the ninth season a new villain emerges, the Ori. The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. The introduction of the Ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on Egyptian mythology into an exploration of the Arthurian mythology surrounding the Ori, their followers, and their enemies¬óthe Ancients.#1
3222_7#The first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts the -thematic- conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between Todd and his bio-engineered replacement. Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways. Not a great film, but one worth seeing.#1
1252_8#The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me. This truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my countrys behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement. We suck. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary Ive seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else hes done. My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inactionbut makes no suggestion of how to help. I dont know about Britain, but Americas made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their governments doings. A gesture in the right direction might help these islanders cause.#1
56_10#This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen.  Home Room is a beautiful film, and thats all there is too it#1
4532_1#My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter and I have to say, I dont let her watch the new episodes on TV, because I find ALL of the characters annoying. Baby Bear AND Telly? OMgosh, How ANNOYING and useless blabber can someone think of for their skits? Elmo? Give it a rest not every kid likes him, once again, annoying and doesnt teach my child ANYTHING. Mr. Noodle? what a reject. I think the one time I turned the new show on for her, she and I were left dumber than before. The show has Definitely taken a wrong turn. I remember the Yip Yips, Kermits Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the GREAT EDUCATIONAL skits of OLD SCHOOL S.S. Sesame Street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and dumbness since Jim Hensons passing in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, funny and interactive skits it used to. I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational blabber. Way to go S.S. producers/writers you have yet another cartoony show for the parents to sit there non-creative, non-exercised kids in front of so theyll get out of their hair. Per Producers/Writers  I suggest you whip out the old muppets and start taping similar content to that of the first Sesame Streets. Lord knows I sure dont want my child talking like Baby Bear or Elmo.#0
1640_10# Heartland  is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier. The hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers. The drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful. She is an example of the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land.#1
11021_1#Hallam Foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of Oedepus complex afterward. Im not even gonna comment on the clich√© indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they have made in the presentation. And all the  cute  sex stuff going on. This whole film is an independent clich√©. But I do recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine.#0
9796_9#In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for Direct-To-Video, but bumped up to theatrical status. It would become known as Batman Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the WB, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. Overall, while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago, MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan, you will love the five-minute short Chase Me.#1
2093_7#This is a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes) but it had a a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, a lot of ground to cover. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day and they dont disappoint here, both giving powerful performances. The only problem is credibility as all the Asians are played by Caucasions and some of them, like Walter Connolly, just dont look real. Id like to see a re-make of this movie with all-Asian actors, not for PC reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible.#1
3950_7#Finally got to see this classic TV movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old VHS, it is a classic piece of horror. Its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS  the TV horror movie. Recommended for all fans of the 70s TV movie much like trilogy of terror. Those interested should get the book on the subject by David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70s. Email me for a chance to see it..its fabulous to see it again. It does have it problems like many TV movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects dept and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today.#1
11214_7#This was the first  Walking Tall  movie I saw, I think in a $2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd. , so I didnt have any reference to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked at the corrupted system of McNairy County and the brutality of the  redneck gangs . I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided hes not going to let it slide, and went out to do something about it. Courageous ? I thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine. A  classic  that Im sure will resurface again in the future.#1
7198_1#After Disneys witty live-action George of the Jungle, I had high hopes for this flick. Major disappointment. Thread bare plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. This film relied on lame one-liners, idiotic ( and pointless) product placement, and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing. I took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind. The only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin!#0
11585_1#What happened? Those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen. Nightmare on Elm St. had gone noticeably downhill after its cult-classic of a first film, but I doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration. Nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film, and nobody is more distraught about it than I am. I know this has mostly been a rant about why Freddy sucks now, but this movie is overall, horrible, and one of the worst movies ever made. Not recommended to anyone, and even ANOES completionists wont want to see this one again.#0
6930_8#This is quite an unusual and unique little western, that is made mostly original due to its story that revolves around an unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all of those who get to poses it at one point or another in the movie. 8/10#1
8145_1#This film is so bad I cant believe it was actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you insane? Did we really watch the same movie? Or the same sh   should I say. Everything is bad in this film. The story (is there a story?) is going nowhere, completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogs are simply just ridiculous), the music score (what the      is that?), the editing, and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. Reminds me the old Macist movies To give you an example of the amateurism of the production, the mermaids costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it. Im not joking, thats exactly what it is. A big, huge, waste of money. Useless.#0
8378_10#What a great film it is. The notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky. The ending is not just a fitting one, its more inspirational. #1
8604_3#Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic  The Warriors ) is the first person in the community to realize that theres murderous slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isnt that frightening, but I digress). No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will. DVD Extras Merely a theatrical trailer for this movie#0
4709_9#Okay - Ill confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney, with charm to spare. There are a few minor flaws - but its probably the best of the spoofs. Some come close, but none of them are quite this good.#1
1528_1#Well, not yet, at least. This is truly a bad movie. (And I liked Ishtar!) ;)#0
3803_9#What people fail to understand about this movie is that it isnt a beginning, middle, and end, it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long TV series. So remember that when you all talk about how the world wasnt explored enough. That was all done in the TV show. The world is amazing, the plot is a lot better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check it out. )#1
2246_10#A wonderful surprise of the Spanish cinema. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a great director, after all, I really dont care much for his choice in movies. However this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all something I ALWAYS enjoy! It hasnt enjoyed much good press and I really dont think itll ever be released in the US market. Well have to content ourselves with the DVD or VHS if even that I dont want to say much about the story because I dont want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it (like sooooooooooo many), before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on.#1
4686_10#This is by far my favorite film of all time. Thats mainly because its not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. However, I dont think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members do a fine job as well. #1
8403_10#i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way! i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched, it. this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format. Ratings john     1/2 Sam      #1
12466_7#If Jean Renoirs first film  Whirlpool of Fate  first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards. Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great  Grand Illusion  and  Rules of the Game.  This is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the films interiors, and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well, particularly from Werner Krauss Muffat. But the glamorous and sultry Ms. Hessling, who at first appears as if she might give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampishness, never goes beyond a one note, selfish harlot portrayal. Perhaps this is in part a problem with the script, which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions; not having read the novel Im not really clear on whether the choices were well-made or not. Far from his greatest achievement, and for me probably just shy overall of  Whirlpool of Fate , this is still well worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally.#1
9256_1#Pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other. Thats it. For about 5 minutes we see this. Its shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music. It LOOKS interesting but theres no plot and really--the violence inherent in this got disturbing. Also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant garde material might like this but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (ocassionally) disturbing. Really--what is the point in all this? I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence. I really wish I could go lower than 1.#0
9992_3#Ah yez, the Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another abominable movie. I was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where, as the survivors desperately searched for matches, at least a half dozen fires burned ¬ñ with no apparent reason ¬ñ at various points of the wreckage. Fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout. They searched corpses for lighters and matches, and finally finding a box built a fire every day for, apparently, 12, but no one ever gathered wood. Then when the vegan (hah) burned the bodies, what did she use for an accelerant? I mean these guys were frozen ¬ñ well maybe not. Despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate, bled. Maybe its just me, but even in a totally unbelievable tale (none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti, or an abominable snowman, until the very end), if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable. Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the remainder of the movie? And the revolver, warm enough to hold in his hand, froze up and wouldnt fire. Gimme a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminently lovely Canadian lass. And, with little irony, Ed Marinaro as the coach. Well I might as well add, the rabbit they ate (despite it looking like chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now if it had been a squirrel (or a rat) it would have been a rodent, but it still looked like chicken. And the writers missed a real chance to have someone note  It tastes just like  #0
4097_8#Youth, sexuality, and the French countryside -- one of the more unique films youre ever going to see. If you can see it that is, no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) Its sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting, and occasionally funny. A trifle boring also in the middle, but all in all you cant call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until youve seen this one at least once.#1
6141_9#Angela Lansbury plays Eglantine a middle aged lady in war torn England, during the WWI. She has been studying witchcraft by mail, and has been secretly learning it in her home, she is doing well, until three children who have been separated from their parents from the last air raid, are sent to stay in Angela Lansburys huge house. She is not happy about having them, because of her secret. They only want to go back home. The oldest boy is very hard to get along with he is a brat. The other two a boy and a girl are just inquisitive about their new place to stay and the lady that is their hostess. The kids find out about her secret and that is when the fun begins. Fun and more of it. Family fun. Laughter, frolic, adventure, something for everyone. The special effects are quite good. This is a musical the tunes are every bit as catchy to sing later as any of the other Disney films. Add this to your Family Video Library. You will not be disappointed.#1
4648_1#This is a bad B movie masquerading as a mockumentary. The porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character. That completely destroyed any  documentary feel  that they may have wanted to create. Someday, someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry. This is not it.#0
4245_3#This movie was based on actual fact? I sincerely hope not! 3/10 for the fine editing.#0
7523_1#Once again I took a chance and rented this bag of crap. Billed as a horror flick, there wasnt one scene, not one, that was even remotely scarey. NOT ONE  Sure there was some nudity, but all the lesbian action got a little old. I guess maybe that was suppose to be this movies saving grace? And Dan, what an annoying ass bag  Right from the beginning I knew I was in for it when good ol Dan first spoke. And he was suppose to be intimidating? What a laugh  All in all, this movie is dreadfully awful! How in the hell do movies like this get made? If you want a movie with a few thrills in it, dont rent this one. This movie is about as thrilling as the Teletubbies.#0
2764_10#On the eighth day God created Georges. But the same as an eighth day doesnt fit into the week, Georges doesnt fit into the modern world He has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, shunted off to an asylum after his mothers death four years ago. She was the only one who loved him. The movie describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism which devours positive values such as human warmheartedness or friendship. It is Georges, the mongol, who seems to be capable of showing the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately his plea comes to a bad end. However, his failure does not necessarily have to mean that it is impossible or not desirable to reach the aspired goal. The way he shows us is surely passable, although it requires a huge amount of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply a radical nonconformism.#1
10186_1#Wheres Michael Caine when you need him? Ive seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-1st season flick (episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three  stars , Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever, delivering lines which must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research. Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8. Makes Logans Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I cant imagine watching it without the commentary of Crow and Servo since its unwatchable even with it. Clearly whats needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401K which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care. With its  rights to pollute and drive  theme, by the end, Im half expecting to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his  cold dead hands  speech. Lee, I could have forgiven you for this in 1989, but 1981?#0
12373_7#Time has not been kind to this movie. Once controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz best-seller, now this film looks like a mere mainstream version of your typical spookfest. Gruesome touches aside (particularly that crazy, over the top finale), this is essentially a glossy horror movie for those people that do not care much for the genre. It has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast in order to convince the audience that this is not your average lowbrow movie (producers of 70s disaster movies had a similar idea). I kind liked to see the familiar faces, but the story is very silly, and no matter how high class the film pretends to be, it operates at the level of your average 70s exploitation movie (not an entirely bad thing, though). Still, it is an enjoyable movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing. As usual, Albert Whitlocks matte work is outstanding. Overall, pretty entertaining.#1
9889_9#Read Erics review again. He perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than I ever could. Im only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it. I am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library. Liked the movie? You have to read the story and then everything else Garcia Marquz wrote. And, by the way, the original location in the story was Colombia.#1
6443_9#Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. It was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago. I never watched or even noticed it before, because it falls (so typically) in the category  Swedish Movie  and those who rose up (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be sceptical of any foreign movies. Hell what a paradigm shift! The film touches me, because it just keeps up my hope, that mankind can change to a better way. The Swedish village is just a pattern for all areas on earth where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, disguised brutality, but also the ability to have fun, to meet, to sing It takes a trigger from outside to rip off the masks of everyone (who keeps one) and to let them feel that we all are just human beings with the desire to live our own lives. I can never stop to see stories like this, because, that keeps up my hope as described above. The five minutes containing the story of Gabriellas song including her performance is one of my movie-highlights ever! Thank you Kay Pollak just for these 5 minutes, which made me happy #1
9325_1#S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself. There was absolutely no acting to speak of. The best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.The budgeting of this movie was sufficient. The filming was sub sesame street. The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book out there for this movie Im sure its better. I would avoid this at all costs. I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.#0
7086_10#NB Spoilers within. This great movie is  about  so many things, all of them successfully sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story. This is one of the great achievements of the 90s, a true favorite of mine, and sure to hold up for a long time to come.#1
6804_1#This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie, A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet, thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps, HUH  Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds, when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!#0
4562_9#Saw this film on DVD yesterday and was gob-smacked and flabbergasted. The unaffected acting of DDL just blew my mind, and I was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting. All of the character were so authentic to me, I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mom. Go and see it! Youll cry your heart out, but youll experience a wonderful catharsis! Besides, it teaches you one important lesson Determination is everything. You may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all. If you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self-pity. It wont get you anywhere and the only person wholl pity you will be yourself.#1

10785_1#Wow, what a great cast! Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Christopher Walken, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Hank Azariawhats that? A script, you say? Now youre just being greedy! Surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary? Youd think so, but no. Americas Sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another. Its like everyone involved woke up before each days writing/shooting/editing and though  You know what? Ive been working pretty hard lately, and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names, right? Im just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can.  So much potential, yet so painful to sit through. There isnt a single aspect of this thing that doesnt suck. Even Julias fat suit is lame.#0

10805_2#The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. Ive always heard how awful it was. The movie did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaqs outfits. The worst parts were, well, just about everything else. My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and couldnt look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max didnt wish for Kazzam to fix that front tooth of his! But for all its terribleness we just couldnt stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic. But it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched  Kazzam .#0
561_10#Anthony Manns westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart - in Manns films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER 73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a  I trust only myself  attitude, which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he (as Jeff Webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle).  Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by John Ford. Mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.#1
9378_9#Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The Hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself. And small town America does not seem all that safer than the Big City. Like its predecessor mentioned above, this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable, but all lead to the cathartic self discovery.#1
1234_10#I grew up watching this movie ,and I still love it just as much today as when i was a kid. Dont listen to the critic reviews. They are not accurate on this film.Eddie Murphy really shines in his roll.You can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.I recommend this movie to everybody to see. It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.With demons ,dragons,and a little bald kid with God like powers.This movie takes you from L.A. to Tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in Tibet.Just a beautiful view! So go do your self a favor and snatch this one up! You wont regret it!#1
7875_7#Page 3 is one of those films Madhur Bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth. The film is compelling, but, like most of Bhandarkars films, it is one-sided and overly pessimistic. This film is all about tabloid journalism, gossip, celebrities. The film exposes the lives of socialites, whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful, peculiar and repulsive. They party, they care for nothing but fame, they plan parties at funerals, they are craving for more money and a higher reputation, they will do anything to get due exposure in the media, to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspapers social column known as  Page 3  with huge photographs which will be the center of peoples discussions. They are attention seeking, salacious and hypocrite. The film industry is shown as sleazy, with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers. Thats where our lovely heroine, a young social column reporter Madhvi Sharma, is thrown. All these people from Mumbais elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article. Later in the film we learn that even those who are Madhvis friends are no different from these high-society people. This was tough viewing for me, although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting. The films music is average. The only passable songs are  Kitne Ajeeb  and  Huzoor-E-Ala , sung by the two melody queens Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle, respectively. Otherwise the soundtrack is bad. One song which was particularly horrendous is  Filmy Very Filmy . The films writing is quite good. The second half is far better than the first, as it turns more matter-of-fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse. Thats where the film has to be applauded. It was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and Konkona Sen Sharmas characters disappointment was very easy to relate to. She was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive. Atul Kulkarnis part was very small but he did full justice to it. Boman Irani is solid as the newspapers editor. Sandhya Mridul is lovable as Madhvis sassy roommate Pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it. The films ending is really well-done, and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings. Page 3 is a good film, it is interesting and at times moving, but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated, overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous.#1
6496_1#This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I am the type of person who starts a movie and doesnt turn it off until the end, but I was forcing myself not to turn it off.  I also agree that Anthony Hopkins needs to stick to acting. By the time the movie was over I didnt even get the plot. I was both confused and annoyed.#0
6815_4#The eight Jean Rollin film I have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! A would-be female vampire (scantily-clad, as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote ch√¢teau and emerges only to feast on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) As if unsure where all of this would lead him, the writer-director ultimately has the human villain ¬ñ actually the blank-faced heros kinky father ¬ñ ludicrously revealed as a mutant(?!) from the future! The languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical of both the film-maker (ditto the seashore setting at the {anti}climax) and the  Euro-Cult  style, as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display. Personally, the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six latter-day Luis Bunuel films) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time #0
2841_10#As a fan of Paris JeTaime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I gladly walked out with all my expectations met. It was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four amazing ones out of all the good ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirblys character being handicapped. The best one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris JeTaime. The skits are well-paced, and the film shows how indie films should really be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris JeTaime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely go see New York, I Love You.#1

10955_1#This is the story of two guys who found a copy of Funky Monkey. Finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local Cineplex Odeon. After seeing such classics as Every Which Way But Loose and Project X, these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome. Shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from Matthew Modine telling them Seven days.#0
12376_1#This collection really sucks! Instead, go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory #0
8632_4#I am a huge Charlton Heston fan. He is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but what was he thinking when he made this movie. Normally if he made a bad movie I could blame it on the screenwriter or director, but in this case its all him. The suckiness of this movie is all his fault. It proves that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and Ill never get that time back. This is by far THE WORST Heston movie that Ive ever seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan maybe youll find this movie entertaining, but if youre not dont waste your time, youll regret it in the long run.#0
11004_1#It really impresses me that it got made. The director/writer/actor must be really charismatic in reality. I can think of no other way itd pass script stage. What I want you to consider is thiswhile watching the films I was feeling sorry for the actors. It felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying. Id really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor. I want to write the jokes didnt appeal to me. but the reality is for them to appeal to you, youd have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard. So imagine that in script formand this guy got THAT green lit. Thats impressive isnt it?#0
7020_10# I mark where there are spoilers! Overall comments If you can take a serious movie, go see this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Dont leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! The movie fits together nicely in the second half. I will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens.  -Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he wont forgive himself for. Its still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt, or if he genuinely wanted to help people. I think its a little bit of bothI think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him because of what he is doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Nice job Will.#1
3810_4#When I was younger, I liked this show, but nowBLECCH  This show is sappy, badly written, and rarely funny. The three leads were all good actors and funny men (Sagets stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with, as was Coulier a better stand up, and Stamos was a better than average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff (who could blame him?). The show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money. Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved since I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just so sugary sweet, I couldnt stand it after a while.#0
942_2#Saw this late one night on cable. At the time I didnt know that the girl billed as  Shannon Wilsey  was actually porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often, thank God) that I actually sat through this brain-rotting drivel. I like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy--more than the next guy, actually--but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid. The truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the directors, writers and special effects peoples virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movies only saving grace. Savannah, before she turned into the plasticized Barbie Doll she became as a porn queen, is really interesting to watch--shes drop-dead gorgeous, bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times, glances off-camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time, which is more than can be said for the audience. For even though Savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked, it still cant hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, badly made and annoying movie. If you know someone who has it on video, or if it comes on cable some night, check it out, but dont waste your money on a rental.#0
1362_4#Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all. Ms. Smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb-red head, but by films end, she is the brains of the outfit. Too bad the writing didnt go the way with her.#0
11228_4#The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. It plods back and forth between vignettes of Betties story and re-creations of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant, retro feel.#0
7448_2#I watched this film version of R.D. Blackmores classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 A&E version was released on video. And what a poor substitution it proved to be  This version does not have the authentic, I-feel-like-Im-there aspect of the A&E movie. The actors are, for the most part, wooden (with Sean Bean the exception) and the  romance  seems forced and contrived. In fact, there is no kissing until the end of the movie  The triangle between John Ridd, Lorna Doone (or Lady Lorna Dugal, whichever you prefer)and the evil Carver Doone isnt mentioned or expanded upon. We dont get much insight into Carver here, or as to why he has some (if any) romantic feelings for Lorna. This movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel, such as Counsellor Doone, and Johns sharp-tongued youngest sister Lizzie which were crucial to the plot. The screenplay itself is lacking in conviction. The political intrigue also doesnt figure in the script. The way Lorna came into being with the Doones isnt true to the original story. Now, dont get me wrong, Clive Owen is a handsome and talented actor (watch Gosford Park and King Arthur for confirmation) but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout, and long hair (it may have been a bad wig) just doesnt suit him  Polly Walker is a lovely and accomplished actress (see Enchanted April and Patriot Games, in which she also costarred with Sean Bean), but she appears colorless and lackluster. She has a cold sore on her lip that make-up cant hide, and the costumes dont seem authentic. The late Robert Stephens does a respectable turn as Sir Ensor Doone, although he only refers to Lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter, which she was reputed to be in the book. Also, it seems to me that Owen and Walker are too old for their roles (maybe its the make-up) and the scenery is brown, cold, gray and barren, without so much of a hint of a sunny sky. I understand that it is set in Southwest England, but it is green there and they do get their sunshine  The portrayal of Tom Faggus character and his  death , which doesnt happen in the novel, depresses the film even more. The one positive note is Sean Beans performance as Carver. Although it doesnt even come close to matching Aidan Gillens portrayal in the A&E movie, Bean does make one mean villain. In short, watch this only if youve got a few hours to kill, but dont expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel. See any other version ( but I highly recommend A&Es film) over this tired adaptation.#0
2861_1#I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better. The acting, the music drowning out the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie all the way through b c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines. I never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered. What did that have to do with the  real  BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors actresses in this movie. The script would have turned me away within the first page of reading. You would be better off watching paint dry.#0
5697_3#This is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story, not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of Irish locations. If the great M.R. James had ever come up with a tale this thin -- doesnt James in fact have a story called  A Thin Ghost ? -- he wouldnt have bothered to have it published. Orson Welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends, this films producers. His presence and the one movie industry in-joke would have earned this will-o-the-wisp its Oscar nomination. This is yet more proof, if any more were needed, that the Academy Awards have never been any guarantee of merit.#0
11410_3#Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as GIDEON. This movie could have been a classic had Lambert performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. Too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life, the supporting performances by Charlton Heston, Carroll OConnor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excelent. 3 of 10.#0
2038_7#This film exceeded my expectations. I thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish, so i wasnt expecting much. However, i was pleasantly surprised. At first i didnt take well to the lead girl and didnt really care if she lived or died. After a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character. Its not just some slasher film where people die for no reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film, but explains a lot. I would recommend this film to everyone. If youre not sure just watch it anyway, its only an hour and a half of your life. Youre going to live for 80 years anyway.#1
4077_1#What do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are excruciatingly long, terrible lighting, painful editing, and awful effects? You get Jessica A Ghost Story Seems its shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this medium. In this case it does not. There are a few CUs where the persons face is entirely in shadow. One scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists. Its a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half but I guess then they wouldnt have a film at feature length. The main character is incredibly flat. Hes the LEAD male, so he should have some  hero  elements to his character, but he does not. He whines and is scared the entire film. I could go on, but I dont want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they did have nice camera movement. Too bad the lighting didnt compliment it. The cover of the DVD is nice, and thats where it ends. Just terrible.#0
2575_7#I rented this film from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for what I thought would be a silly 50s sci-fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length Superman film. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised. The film is a little unevenly paced. Although the Molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. By todays standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this films special effects and costuming were quite good. The cinematography is also generally very good, and the acting is much better than one might expect. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.#1
3559_10#I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. I thought the movie was well cast. I performed in regional versions of this and its one of my favorites of that period.#1
7170_9#HOLES is not your average Disney stuff- its very, very fun, even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy, focus-group designed  family entertainment  that Uncle Walts studio passes off as live-action. Perhaps the secret of this films success is in its faithfulness to the original book, which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation. But as the story progresses, Stanleys tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about an all-boy prison camp has any right to be. Jon Voight is especially nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.#1

9356_3#Marilyn Miller made only three films before her untimely death - the marvelous SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this trifle - SUNNY (1930). It is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - although she has four dance numbers, she only sings two songs (WHO? and ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned, although we can hear the latter in the background scoring. Miller looks overweight and amateurish here - no star quality at all. Even her dancing is cloutish. The film is very badly written, stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations. If youre interested in Miller as a performer, by all means, check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.#0
2939_10#Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably THE funniest. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy Ive ever seen and it is a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh  Ive watched this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still have side-splitting fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much - that you will miss half of them! Delirious is hilarious! Although there are a lot of funny comedians out there - after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them will seem like second-class citizens. If you have never seen it - get it, watch it - and you will love it  It will make you holler  -)#1

7856_10#Mary Pickford often stated that Tess Skinner was her favorite movie role. Well said! She played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced, she not only had to purchase the rights from Adolph Zukor but even give him credit on the films main title card. Needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning. Indeed, in my opinion, the movie itself rates as one the all-time great experiences of silent cinema. In all, an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values.#1
7024_8#I just saw this film in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on it, so i thought id check it out. i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again. the actors were really good and i loved all the music! there was not a lot of talking in the film, which at first felt a little strange- but once i got into it, i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination. i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things, but know that i left the theater thinking about the film. it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique.#1
6273_9#I really loved this film, yes, I know it was fairly far fetched, there is no way that Shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all its traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the Brit Bad Guy, he was a little  too  much dont you think? Anyway, great film, great cars and great acting. I for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night. )#1
12061_10#Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror,diamonds are crafted, and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance. This is no less than a diamond  This is a film brimful of eeriness,chilling anticipation, and dark atmosphere, and I think its safe to say, one of my favourite horror films of all time! And of course it contains probably the single most, flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror! Every time I see the film, and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be frightened out of my wits, but it never fails to happen; I never get it right, and I find myself as terrorized as the first time I saw it  Now, it must be said, to scare a jaded horror fan like that, that is nothing short of pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the Brits know their subtleties, they take pride in the art of acting, they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent story, and the creepiness(in this case)of suggestion and anticipation. Every single element is impeccable, from the set pieces, the acting, the story, to the menacing atmosphere. Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper, thats for sure  As an end note, if you for some demented reason dont like this piece of insanity, then you honestly dont know what horror is all about, and frankly do not deserve to know it either. Thank you!#1
7696_8#When  Good Times  premiered in 1974, it was one the first black family sitcoms. It centered on the poor Chicago-based Evans family and their struggles to make ends. Most of the early episodes focused on the parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide for the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were terrific actors and had great chemistry as James and Florida Evans. They had three kids J.J., Thelma, and Michael. J.J. was the skirt-chasing but well-meaning teenage son who made up for his lack of subtletly with artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, bright girl who was constantly trading insults with J.J. Michael was a near child prodigy who was well-educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer. First three season A. Last three seasons C+.#1
6951_10#I was never a big fan of television until I watched 24 for the first time. I got into the series very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode. It was an episode of Series 3 that was on my parents DVR (digital video recorder) box while I was house sitting for the weekend. It took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of Jack Bauer. And boy was I hooked  I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money Ive ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. Thats 72 forty minute episodes  I will say that finding out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting an entire week. I can only imagine the anticipation of watching Season 6 week to week  I find it mildly torturous and cruel but Im going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of America  The DVR is set and you can bet Ill be chomping at the bit #1
10380_10#in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon. i was 23, and had been married for a little over three years, and was beginning to come out as a lesbian. i saw this movie on an old black and white TV, with terrible reception, alone, and uninterrupted, in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story. i was living in a small house in tucson arizona, and it was summertime like everyone else here, i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth, and its residue of fragile magic, and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday. ill keep checking in. i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verels the other side of venus. it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy#1

5349_4#This straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moraniss career. As is the Disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in; this is a lazy retread with Moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer, which did nothing but make me pine for the days of The Incredible Shrinking Man, when this kind of thing was done properly. Shockingly, this is directed by top cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time.#0
6532_4#The film begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in Space near out planet. When its retrieved, one of the crew members is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member. PS--When you watch the film, pay careful attention to Dr. Tremayne. He looks like the spitting image of Dr. Quest from the  Jonny Quest  cartoon! Plus, he sounds and acts a lot like him, too.#0
8214_4#This doesnt quite plumb the depths of Creepshow 3, but it comes close. It also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is distracting to say the least. Overall basically not dissimilar from the two newer Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. But theres nothing really spectacular here.#0
9677_9#This movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids. The movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level. I watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny, entertaining,and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years. I watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining. This movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life. This movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.#1
8539_8#Touching and sad movie. Portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident. The film centers on his relationship with his married lover, whom he is often very hostile towards, and his interactions with other accident victims, particularly a black down-and-out and a white-supremacist biker. The film is often humorous, often sad, and always believable. Get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy Sunday afternoon with your partner.#1
1245_7#Whenever I see most reviews its called a misfire for Eddie Murphy. These critics want to take a look at some of the stuff hes doing these days, and maybe soften their stance in retrospect  The Golden Child  is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clich√©s, and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I dont understand the pervading lack of love for its efforts, at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; its unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. Theres nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends. Yes its silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that ridiculous is where Hollywoods idea of mysticism begins and ends. Whats more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.#1
5707_2#I watched this movie last night on one of the pay-per-view channels, and while watching it I quickly wondered why I bothered. In all honesty I really did expect something more from this film. Maybe something along the lines of Conspiracy Theory. Why? Maybe because of the casting. I mean, Nicolas Cage and Harvey Keitel, after all. Not to mention Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer. Now Im wondering, why did they bother? But instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama I was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a l√† The Goonies, which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise. Perhaps its because The Goonies was clearly targeted toward the pre-teen and teen audiences. Whereas National Treasure, judging from the previews, was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience. Okay, okay. If you pant over chases, explosions, and gee-whiz gimmickry youll enjoy National Treasure. But its the sort of movie, well, have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out? And all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like,  Wow! Did you see how that thing blew up? That was so cool!  National Treasure is that kind of movie.#0
4349_10#Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes to his sons place unexpectedly.His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is quite surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) has left his father.Bens wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father go see a farmhouse thats for sale.But thats not the end of their journey.Their road trip turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father.Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks (2005).Paul Reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job.The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing.And he did work with the script for twenty years so no wonder its this good.Who would be better man to play the father than Peter Falk? Nobody, I can tell you that.And I really love the story on why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the part.Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh.And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie.Its just hilarious when they go fishing.And how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick.The movie is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times.But it can also be touching from time to time.You couldnt tell a story any better than it is told here.#1

4968_1#I was expecting the movie based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the Beowulf epic, but told from the perspective of the monster.  Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.#0
10332_8#Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) stands trial for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses give evidence - Father Warecki (Henry Travers), Wilhelms brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Wilhelms former lover Marja (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense. The film ends after the court sums up. Throughout the film, Knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest. This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.#1
10748_4#Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field? Well this happens about 25 times in this movie(clearly the directors favorite scare tactic). In one of the opening scenes the smooth talking/hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film. Shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and, although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute. After about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clowns history in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie check out the ladies chest.. her ribs go all the way to her neck, it was flat out disgusting. Most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors backyard. The movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically. SIGNED, THE ANSWER#0
8680_9#Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market. This market is essentially dominated by the Looney Tunes and the Merry Melodies shorts, coming from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able of releasing hidden gems, like  To Spring , an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year. In conclusion,  To Spring  is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era. What is even more remarkable is that this cartoons director made his debut here. And who is  To Spring  s director? Its a certain William Hanna#1
9083_8#I enjoyed this movie and I had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews I read before going. I went because I was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans. Oh and its from Korea which has put out some of my favorite movies. I liked Host but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. Yes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its unusual quirky sense of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?#1
7182_1#I couldnt not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel (trust me, double negatives are required here -- its that bad). This film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. The musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good ( Thank You Very Much  has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would gladly bear the chains worn by Scrooge in the films bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again. Steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs.#0
10763_8#I must admit that I was very sceptical about this documentary. I was expecting it to be the kind of All American Propaganda that we here in Europe dislike so much. I was wrong. This is NOT propaganda, in fact it is hardly political at all. Regards,#1
8695_9#A long time ago, I watched this movie from the middle on cable. I then had a crush on Mary Moronov. I saw her again in Eating Raoul. I was convinced that shes the hottest woman on screen. Thiss the only movie I own on original tape.#1
12062_10#This film has been scaring me since the first day I saw it. So obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me. It scared the s    out of me. Ive been immune to horror films since watching this #1
3699_3# One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role, to be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie, and that wasnt even during the final comedy-scene (which one would also expect to be the funniest). This is one you can watch when it comes to TV, dont spend any other money renting it.#0
4168_4#Well, this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more adult oriented humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-Disney Channel type mode, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really fake Italian accent. The movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget. There was one very cute moment which Ill just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner. The laughs are very few and far between. The end surprise for  Mr. Fix It  is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else. Might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or TV but dont waste your money buying or renting this movie.#0

5958_9#Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like, some you dont. A few are related--mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not one smooth, happy with everyone and everything, type of life--much like real life. Some story lines do not evolve, they just happen. But like true families and good friends, they stick together. The wanna-be parents who are buying a baby are such a--holes! You are happy for the ending. Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself, her mom, her son, and trying to keep all their lives together. This does not end with a sunset walk or house in the burbs and all are living in a dream world, but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day, month to month. Overall, this is a good story and a great movie #1
8076_7#Family is about two families who are after each others blood. There were a few loose points in the script; like; Amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot-free in the city. Kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague. How can the family of such a big don doesnt have any security cover?#1
4852_1#I saw this movie once, and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said  Watch it again, its better . So I did. And to my surprise, it was WORSE on the second time! Theres a word limit, so Im going to get the ball rolling here. The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favour, just skip this, and dont give into the hype.#0
7103_7#I was pretty surprised with this flick. Even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good. The acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste. But hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded. I would really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look up Antonella R√≠os who is an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting). Antonella R√≠os truly is a star on the rise.#1
2470_10#After the initial shock of realizing the guts of Mr Branagh to film this, I was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me. I was not disappointed. So true to Shakespeare and yet so accessible. It blew my mind. I always enjoy seeing, or rather listening to, Branagh and it made me wonderis this movie dubbed in other countries? That would be like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa.#1
5921_7#I was the Production Accountant on this movie, and I also got to do some voice-over work on it, so Im not entirely unbiased, but if it were awful, I would say so. I thought it was a fun film, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, by any means, but there were plenty of laughs along the way. The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine, so watching this movie could be good for your health. So many of the actors in this picture hadnt yet reached their peak at the time we made this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, is one who has since gone on to much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the  Thirty-Something  TV drama series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still haunting peoples dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedic actor, and a truly nice, sincere person. We all had fun working on this show, and I think that fun comes through.#1
9617_2#Three years ago, Rachel(Therese Fretwell) was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and drowns. Rachels friends think it is time for her to stop beating herself up and taking blame for something she had no control over. So grab the brew and something to chew and head back to the same lake that has been in Rachels constant nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath has already started when two of the friends are splattered before even heading to the party. This flick has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and winged itvery badly! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the meatier role as Rachels boyfriend Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel there are some pretty lame acting and a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of before they get offed. Giving attention to a few more players that had the nerve to appear Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one MEMORIAL DAY you wouldnt mind missing.#0
8455_2# Arahan  adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre. To compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of Stephen Chows films is a mistake. The attractive female lead So-Yi Yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang had done so easily in  House Of Flying Daggers . Having a Martial Arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies. To cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (See Aya Ueto in  Asumi ) unless you are a very talented director which as  Arahan  proves Seung-wan Ryoo is not.#0
8473_8#This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful  The Legend of Boggy Creek  is a follow-up in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called  Big Bay Ty  that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute, pigtailed future  Different Strokes  sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids rescue. Tom Moores casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace, astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail, drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection, and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic, restrained, unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on  Gilligans Island ) gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethards capable, sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil, achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor. Darrell Decks score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition, this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90s kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance.#1
2376_4#George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress. She is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune. He interviews her on her yacht. They fall for each other in bathing costumes. The supporting cast does little to buoy it up. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Though its fairly predictable, it is also fairly entertaining. Its far from her best. But, especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre, its not one of her worst, either.#0

11209_3#This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. Its silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers. In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight. This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. With more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation.#0
11057_3#What about Dahmers childhood?- The double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body? What about  infinity land ? - The game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another, suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger. What about the relationship between his parents, and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father? His feelings of neglect when his brother was born? What about his fascination with insects and animals? How he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home?What about focusing more on his cannibalism? And what about his parents divorce? These are all things that should have been included in the film. Instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down snapshot from a night or two in his life, and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks, to events that werent even particularly relevant to our understanding of Dahmer. Aside from the facts and lack of depth, the film isnt all bad. There is some nice cinematography, and good performances from the two main characters. Id like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge, more energy, and a better reason for making the film in the first place.#0
11429_1#Wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen  This person should never make another movie I cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience.YOu have have wasted every cent. No concept of real life. I have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back. EVER  Everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed  Im embarrassed for them! All of you should be ashamed. If i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years. Please never watch this movie.I have never written a blogg about a film before but The distaste for this film has compelled me to do so.#0
2823_7#MGM were unsure of how to market Garbo when she first arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in  Torrent  justified that. She did not speak a word of English so she must have found it difficult to work, also Ricardo Cortez did not make it very easy for her. Highly Recommended.#1
1967_4#Darcy and her young daughter Pamela are heading out to the country where her mums boyfriend Peter left his doctors position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn. Although this inn has a terrible past and Pamela learns from one the girls who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house. They called her the Tooth Fairy as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth. This work on the inn, has awoken the Tooth Fairy. Now she has her sights on Pamela and her last baby tooth, but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits Pamela. I thought it was a okay time-waster that has a sound concept, which just isnt fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff. Watchable nonsense, but at the same time extremely forgettable.#0
8691_1#If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still couldnt make it through from beginning to end. I cant believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise! The acting is atrocious all around, the script is blah, the kid playing Nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened. The  southern  accent from the actress playing Ambers mom is laughable - Im from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me NOBODY talks like that! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment.#0
11408_7#Etienne Girardot is just a character actor--the sort of person people almost never would know by name. However, he once again plays the coroner--one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films that played his role more than once. Ive already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air. This film also is great to watch because in addition to Girardot, there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride--including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is quite an impressive cast, and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. Well worth seeing and exciting--though also quite impossible.#1
4860_2#Horrible, horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! I am, of course, speaking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I was exclusively talking about those seasons, this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good. They were, and are, awful. The comedy is not funny at all. AT ALL   The original cast was full of very talented comedians, like Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr, and Mary Schorr (or whatever her name is), all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left MAD TV. This show is highly overrated, and less worthy of your channel surfing time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Go out on Saturday night and have fun, and leave MAD TV to wither and die, as it deserves to.#0
9388_4#Former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession. His assignment to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in Californiaand apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement) doesnt give off the impression of having high regard for the 40s films his  Chandler  was borne from; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this 70s variant on the private dick archetype, but the movie doesnt have any snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and Carons hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil.  1/2 from     #0
1719_7#By 1909, D.W. Griffith had been directing films for the Biograph Company for about a year, and ¬ñ working at a rate of two or three per week ¬ñ was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker. The Sealed Room is a very interesting 11 minute short, a fascinating piece of Gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror. The simple narrative was probably inspired by Edgar Allen Poes 1846 short story,  The Cask of Amontillado,  and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wifes infidelity. Despite these innovations, The Sealed Room suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era. The entire film takes place in just two rooms, with footage captured from a total of just three positions, and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times. The acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect, however, at least in the case of Arthur V. Johnson, his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king. A moment that I thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room, only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone. Their panicked reactions, accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king, serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia. I did think, however, that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly.#1
11270_10#Make no mistake, Maureen OSullivan is easily the most gorgeous Jane ever, and there will never be one more gorgeous. She is visually stunning. That aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. This is a great film. It not only has the classic Tarzan aura, but also the feel of the continuing saga. We become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other, a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history.And these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic. There is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted. However, the Africans are depicted as individuals, and at the end, two even become more heroic than the white hunters, and stand out as such. In fact, the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. The finale, also, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great lion attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction. If I left anything out, it is because I do not want to soil the picture for those who havent seen it. But it is everything you could want in a movie.#1
9687_3#This is a baffling film.  Greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships.#0
5052_10#This is an excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar , the winter, canoeing , trapping , hunting and the like. It is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me . Brosnan does well portraying a complex man , a very fine performance. Annie Galipeau is lovely in her first large role. The rest of the cast is solid.#1
4314_10#I revisited Grand Canyon earlier this year when I set out to devise a ten best list of the 1990s. I first saw the film when I was 17 years old. How did I hear about it? It was reviewed, and recommended highly, by Siskel & Ebert in 1991, and I eventually caught it on video a year later. I fear that Grand Canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non-new releases at the video store. But with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents, I plead with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it, Grand Canyon is something special. If you loved Magnolia, another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes, youll love Grand Canyon, too.#1
5959_2#A spoiler. If a cop s head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too funny a concept to try and be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised heavily.#0
4049_7#Erich Rohmers  LAnglaise et le duc  makes a perfect companion piece to Peter Watkins  La Commune (Paris 1871).  Both films -screened at this years Toronto International Film Festival- ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale. Ironic, given the tragic events that were taking place in the U.S. during the festival. #1
4515_1# Piece is Cake  is defeatist, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the (admittedly fictional) pilots it portrays. It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.  Piece of Cake  is an absolute, total misrepresentation of the way pilots in Fighter Command acted at the time. It is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace#0
1355_1#I saw Crispin Glovers  What Is It?  at the Ann Arbor film festival. Admittedly, the film was at least aptly named, because I got the distinct sense that even the writer/director could provide no answer. At the question and answer session after the screening, Mr. Glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with down-syndrome. However, this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film. Actors are, in my opinion, building blocks for a larger vision - a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worst. Glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film. If only it had been. At seventy-two minutes, the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty, and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time.#0
7478_10#Im from Romania ill try to speak in English. All i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one. Seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now. It has all the little things i like in a movie , its very touching makes me cry . Shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people. It so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , hes inner being, and this i see in this movie. Perhaps for me its much more than a motion picture , its a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate. Its a long way from reality to sci-fi , but .. what if. What if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down , would fall? We would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that , on your death bed , the bigger thing you remember , is not the wealth , not the adventure , not the countries you visited and the people that remember you. But the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die , all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more. WATCH THIS MOVIE and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me ) Hail from Romania#1
7897_8#At first sight this movie doesnt look like a particular great one. After all a Bette Davis movies with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6,5 must be a rather bad one. But the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. 8/10#1
9538_2#When I saw the commercial for this, I was all about seeing it. Now, forgive me, but its been so long since Ive seen it that I dont recall how it went. Suffice it to say, the movie I saw bore no resemblance to the  movie  they sold me on. I was bored, annoyed, and incredibly disappointed by this movie. And if it wasnt bad enough, they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music. Not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie, eh mon? I guess if you never saw the commercial (or trailer, I suppose) you may think this is some hot stuff. For my money, the commercial was way better.#0
9121_10#SPOILERS CONTAINED IN ORDER TO MAKE A OBSERVATION. Are Prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs? Maybe that is why Prince started to run out of steam during the 90s because he ran out of his fathers ideas???..Hmmmm..#1
585_10#Upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times I have viewed it. The acting is stunningly wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s. The scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western Montana. All in all, this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s. #1
7383_9#Extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of S√£o Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbania. For the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film, it has the grit of Mexican feature  Amores Perros  with a character not too far off Max Cady, from both Cape Fears, although this is not, by any means, a film about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay hitman Anisio (Miklos) to off their third partner (and majority share holder) in said construction outfit. The murder is blamed on the city, but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare Anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime, not only trespassing but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in. The look is almost entirely handheld, grainy, the performances outstanding throughout, especially so as first time actor (and member of classic Brazilian pop band Tit√£s), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror. I saw the film at the Bras√≠lia film Fest in November 2001. It has since done very well in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendon√ßa Filho#1
1340_2#96 minutes of this is cruel..and I love the old Munsters. Yes, the plot is thing; yes the lines are trite; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan. There is so much intrigue (and I use that word with great pause) that I wonder if its an old Starsky & Hutch episode. I lost count of the number of times I noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar. Refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60s (ludicrous) the producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors. Why not let them grow and age? The addition of an Addams Family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the Halloween Party. If you are a real fan of the Munsters then youll have to RENT this mess. It illustrates how some things are better left alone. Even with the (nearly) original cast, this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago.#0
10053_8#I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as  Steamy Romance  I was a little bit skeptical.  Steamy ? In a movie from 1968?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot entirely in black & white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed. I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action Although it wont be all you expect, I dont think youll be too, too disappointed.#1
7487_1#Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. The couple having sex in the park. They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie & Steve do a bit of slap stick. The whole movie winds up being like thisa joke is set up and given away. Why isnt Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. You will also notice every close up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, thats if you want to laugh.#0
7286_2# The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.#0
2972_7#I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of its release and had it come out today it would be a hit. Dont bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come. Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.#1
3609_8#Went to Wal-Mart and found this film on DVD and had no idea whether I made a bad purchase or a good one. It is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end. Michelle Rodriquez,(Diana Guzman), BloodRayne ,05, gave a great performance and her looks are beautiful, sexy, and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed. Diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother. She decides to get boxing training in a local Brooklyn Gym and is not really well accepted by the male boxers. In her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys. There is lots of action in the ladies bathroom and references as to private parts of guys. If you like boxing, and seeing a hot sexy gal do wonders in the ring and knock the boys on their you Know What, this is the film for you.#1
6161_1#This is possibly the worst fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot, characters are so weak that theyve got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose to maintain audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abrahams talents. Youre better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens its got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.#0
5934_10#Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please dont entertain us what we would really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more. I was looking around to see when it was coming out. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie. Unfortunately its not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors and all the actors great job but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more.#1
8325_1#I just saw this movie last night and, being someone who had very low expectations to begin with, was still disappointed. The most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point (the guy being awake during the surgery), had NOTHING to do with the outcome. It would have ended the same way regardless. So, what was the point of this? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didnt think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just laughable from start to finish. Im fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel, you would be in more pain than that.#0
10944_1#Now, Ive seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. Ive seen (and enjoyed) all of Jean-Claude Van Dammes movies, including the one where hes his own clone, both of the ones where he plays twins, and all three where hes a cyborg. I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, hes got a great ass and you almost always get to see it. With DVD, you can even pause and zoom in!) Thats why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad, it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane. It didnt help much, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron Palillos cameo as a gay arsonist.#0
10388_4#From reading all of the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but I didnt think it was THAT bad. Ive seen much worse, actually. To sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story. Dont go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on TV you can give it a shot. 4/10.#0
2529_7# The Invisible Ray  is part science fiction and part horror. It was also the third of seven Karloff/Lugosi features. In this entry the dominant role goes to Boris Karloff. At 79 minutes this film was the second longest of the six Karloff/Lugosi collaborations. Karloffs film all the way.#1
4203_2#What begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns, almost instantaneously, into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable, but some things are just not humanly possible. I checked the box indicating that my comments contained  spoilers , but theres nothing more I or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven.#0
7536_10#The persons comment that said that Pat Robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare what evil and righteous is. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good! He doesnt even know that he fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you dont know God and refuse to know him now, thats okay. He still loves you but when you do finally bow your knee to Him, and you will, it will be too late for you. God sends no one to hell, not even you! You will go there of your own decision and your spewing defines it! May God have mercy on you and give you a Damascus Road experience. The 700 Club and Pat Robertsons ministry is one of the reasons Im still here. On the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God reached through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God He did! You have a right to say what you said but you dont have a right to curse with your words. God have mercy on you.#1
4206_9#Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train. What he doesnt realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm, microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations. Its a B movie in texture but an A film in execution, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10#1
11673_8#Having seen Charley Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see how Charley would be in his own show. I thought Charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth. Its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness, it just shows their human too! I dont know a lot about bikes, but this show gripped me right from the start. The preparation and organising for this event seems immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and Im fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets. I love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music. I cant believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope its not the end, I cant wait to see the next episode#1
3994_4#I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. Im slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of his work. Wait for it to come on cable. I wouldnt have minded paying for it as a matin√©e, but Im feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it.#0
6262_9#This was incredible, meaning that it was hard to believe, that the  forgotten tribe  would make this astounding migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didnt stage some of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness. I had the pleasure of seeing this and  Kon Tiki  on the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.#1
10097_1#I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspect. So Im not expecting much. But it should at least have a story. Stories dont cost a thing except time..apparently, they didnt have any time either. It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off. I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb wont allow me to use decimals.#0
6016_10#This movie is one of the masterpieces from Mr. Antonioni. It is about youth, distraction, happiness, alienation, materialism, honor, corruption. And it is like everything else from great Italian director -true art. #1
8803_4#I loved  Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy  and hoped this would be just as funny, but alas, it wasnt. Some bits are excellent though. I thought the sports guy, Champ Kind, professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious. Everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses Burgundy which doesnt get acknowledged either. But on the whole the story doesnt gel. Its a noble attempt, however, to salvage the unused bits from the first movie, including an entire plot about some pretty benign would-be domestic terrorists called  The Alarm Clock.  Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie. The extras on this disk are pretty good, with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy, and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an  exec producer  who Ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way, shape or form. Turns out hes  just a guy  who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. Its some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes#0
926_7#I dont know why some people criticise that show so much. rating 8/10#1
10521_1#This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4. I have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose. This is also a  horror  film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight. My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared. The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie, half of the time she is British and half the time she is American.#0
430_1#Wow. This is really not that good.   /    #0
6664_9#I just dont understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here. Jeez. It is mindless, it isnt polished and it is (as I am reading) wasted on some. The cast of this movie plays their characters to the T (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Ben Stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination. The problem is they dont realize their limits until the big showdown and thats the point! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel. I just dont get it. The jokes work on more then one level; if you didnt get it I know what level youre at.#1
10303_7#Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone Gods powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carreys facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10#1
10744_8#The events of September 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two French brothers. In my view it would have been better to leave this out. I think the directors tried too hard, perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop. The comment of one of a policemen -  this aint f   ing Disneyworld  is apt. Nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events. The filmakers were in all the right places at the right times, no other footage from the day matches what they shot.#1
4430_1#Thanks to a dull, dimensionless screenplay by Neil Simon, and lackluster direction from Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes a shrill showcase for Marsha Mason who received her third of four Oscar nods for Chapter Two giving the same performance here that she gave in Cinnderella Liberty(73), The Goodbye Girl(77), Audrey Rose(78) and Only When I Laugh(81);only this time she doesnt have a child to drag around. Chapter Two is the third and last feature film for Moore having previously directed Neil Simons The Cheap Detective(78) and Murder By Death(76). Caan is miscast, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialog is overly analytical, and theres virtually no establishing detail. The first half is a less-than-captivating, meet cute, coy romance between a blinkered Caan and a chipper Mason, and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half. The NYC locations as well as Joe Bologna, and a painfully thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some welcome distraction. And last and least, theres an awful song played during the credits.#0
6119_9#okay, but just plain dumb. Not bad for a horror/comedy film. I was reading how people switched it with the Michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe (never seen it) the horror (possibly comedy) uncle Sam, ill have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on VHS of Amazon and got it November 21, the day before thanksgiving. worth the four bucks, l.o.l. at this film. 9/10#1
5164_4#The basic plot in this movie isnt bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. But, despite good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is just awful. Instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares off into space and has a  golly I am SOOOO stunned  expression. After just a few minutes it really became annoying for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I dislike for her performance, as she had done more than her share of overacting--in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try a different Crawford film--there certainly were better.#0
3971_1#Give me my money back! Give me my life back! Give me a bit of credit. This movie was vomit worthy. Useless and time consuming. What a waste of energy and totally pointless. Okay I understand the premise and the idea sound but, give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mothers remorse, blamed husband! Clich√© yes~! Get a life! Sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I would rather watch eggs cook! No real explanation to why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obvious but Why? Acting deserves a What am I doing here Oscar and the cinematography a Am I just doing this for a Wage? How much did this movie make? Well this silly fool hired a copy. Enough said#0
6595_9#I happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it, and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, based on certain relics that are found in both places, certain types of ancient sea-going vessels that we know they had available, analysis of ocean and wind currents, and the knowledge that the Incas did, in fact, travel in some undetermined amount at sea. His theory, like so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right. The film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the 100+ day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced. I often wish that Academy Award winning documentaries were easier to find, and this one from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I am sure it was when it was first released.#1
5140_4#Demer Daves,is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and  broken arrow  remains in everybodys mind.As far as melodrama is concerned,he should leave that to knowing people like Vincente Minelli,George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie.Natalie Wood s character was inspired by Fannie Hursts  imitation of life  (see Stahl and Sirk),but who could believe shes a black mans daughter anyway?Susan Kohner was more credible in  imitation of life )and Sinatra and Curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with themthe poor officer,and the wealthy good-looking -and mean- sergeant.Guess whom will Natalie fall in love with?France is shown as a land of tolerance ,where interracial unions are warmly welcome.At the time(circa 1944) it was dubious,it still is for narrow-minded people you can find here there and everywhere.#0
12487_3#This film was a big disappointment. I really love every one of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.#0
12336_3#I give this five out of 10. All five marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material. Unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! We have countless full-face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? We dont see his hands on the guitar thats the point! Also were given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind? There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur fools operate all of them. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, complete waste of film! If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. The one gem it does contain is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight#0
2866_1#No words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the BTK killer. Rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film. From start to finish, there was not one single highlight. The entire thing was horrendously put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-funny, for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together. This review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low-budget film, but this is not the case. Just thinking about the movie I have just seen makes my blood start to boil. How this film was ever granted rights for production i will NEVER know. I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it is truly a stand-out in regards to how pathetic, and disturbingly awful it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film-going, this is the WORST. MOVIE. EVER. I wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand, had I known what I was in for. ZERO out of TEN.#0
3071_4#I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasnt worth my time, or my friends. I think this story is not worth telling. Its like saying that old people have a past before they got old (no kidding). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. Ive always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. Im writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try.#0
1704_8# I moved out here to get away from this kind of thing!  The small town sheriff laments. The Martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on. Its a fun family movie.#1
1318_8#I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra as it has received a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. This is an old movie and the animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. There are few if any references to specific Japanese culture and great for Anime novices to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra himself is witty and likable. I cannot say how much of this is due to the English dub or the intentions of the maker, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find truly funny. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. I cannot think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. You barely realise that it is happening, but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. You also really feel the characters went on a journey and theyre lives were changed by the whole experience. Check out if you can.#1
3298_10#This is definitely one of the best movies Ive ever seen-- it has everything-- a genuinely touching screenplay, fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch, an actually elegant romance (its a shame that that kind of romance just doesnt seem to exist anymore), lovely songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them. The ending was only a disappointment in that I was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end-- but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there. Definitely check this movie out-- over and over again. There are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look.#1
1374_8#A French film Ester Williams would love. But the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a Paris exurbia finding themselves. No question where Sciammas sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as  animaux  but actually only the 3 girls are in focus, and for the entire time, with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background. Marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on Floriane ( a Renascence quality beauty per one reviewer) and she is also a friend of convenience to Anna not unattractive, but for her, the time of her bodys perfection was short, and now she is an adolescent in a womens body. What ensues is a journey to self-realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un-natural where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth? While the d√©nouement was breath taking, with Florianes self-absorption beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, it all seemed abstract, Sciammas puppets.#1
9363_2#This movie has some fatal flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr.s office, is just bad writing or bad editing.  Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie no actor would want on their resume.#0
6393_8#This is a must see for independant movie fans, but it also holds up well against mainstream movies. I think we have the makings of the next Woody Allen or #1
5044_1#I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, Im also Shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter. However, after watching it, I was extremely disappointed. The movies pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous. The director lingered on certain scenes for much too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was barely any dialogue. Dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the movie, you didnt feel any compassion for the characters. This movie was lacking in everything. The script was weak, the acting was poor, and the editing was non-existent. The director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably. A good movie is one in which captures your attention, maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by. This movie felt as though it would never end. Dont waste your money on this movie.#0
6604_3#The first one was the best. The second one sucked because the dialog was terrible. Although, the storyline wasnt so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). Throughout the movie, I dosed off a few times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expertise, but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker, too, wasnt good. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible acting (But thats based on her script). All the characters there were not that good. But, some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan doesnt do those things which is good for him.#0
11548_4#Jeez, only in the 70s Antonio Margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure-hunt. The spices of this trashy co-production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian one-off company include humorous storytelling, off-the-wall happenings and some very tame T&A. Extra campy moments are being served by Lee Van Cleefs obnoxious wig, leather-clad bible-thumping psycho gunman Yancey Hobbitt (loveably hammed up by Julian Ugarte, the man who shouldve done way more obscure European genre productions than he did), wanna-be-witty dialogue, hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events (especially every jump made by Lo Lieh). This is my truth. What is yours?#0
6857_10# Dressed To Kill , is one of the best thrillers ever made. Its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults. Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialog, and he tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his visuals, and Pino Donnagios brilliant score. Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be seen in widescreen, as De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story. Cropped, on video,  Dressed To Kill , is barely the same movie. Solid performances from its cast, superb direction, and, perhaps, the finest film score ever written, make  Dressed To Kill  a must see.#1
8236_1#I cant believe this is on DVD. Even less it was available at my local video store. I give a  1 , since I cant give a  0 . I just dont see any way this movie could be entertaining.#0
7114_4#As far as cinematography goes, this film was pretty good for the mid 50s. There were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus. The acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible. Several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non-existent. The attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings. I also couldnt help but think the budget didnt allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon. Honestlyit would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie. It wasnt bad enough to be a  good-bad  movie but wasnt good enough to be  good  either. Get the MST3K versionits more fun.#0
12214_3#Well what I can say about this movie is that its great to see so many Asian faces. What I didnt like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. The Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead, the white guy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the  keeping it real  black cab driver. Plus all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. The story plot itself was fun but pretty much how I thought the story would unravel. Then again when watching romantic comedies you cant expect much but then again I would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once. The parents are the best part of the flick.#0
2267_1#Please avoid this movie at all costs. This is without a doubt, the worst movie Ive ever seen. Most movies have at least one redeeming value. This has none. Totally horrible!#0
7089_9#Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films of the Sci-fi genre and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality. An apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound, 12 MONKEYS never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout. Excellent use of Philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place. RATING 9 of 10#1
3660_1#I saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently, on one of those dollar DVDs that seem to be everywhere nowadays, and was so moved by it that I cannot contain myself. For those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable Mexican import, and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone elses jaundiced commentary, there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows. So if you are one of those reckless individuals, stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself. If you get drunk enough in advance, you might be fortunate enough to pass out before its over. Of course, one doesnt really expect any sense from a film like this, but at least it ought to be good for laughs. This one isnt. Forget it, buddy. There is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film, from its patched-together, tequila-drenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score, that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any MST3K type laughs out of it. If its not even good for that, what the hell is it good for? If Montezumas revenge could have somehow been digitally remastered and put on a DVD, it would have looked exactly like this movie.#0
4595_10#Jackie Chan name is synonomus to stunts. This movie never let you down.The opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder ,if he knows the meaning of fear.This movie comes very close to Jackies best which is PROJECT A.But the main difference being that PROJECT A contains three stars where as in this movie Jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders.This is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee.The film has nice comic touches too. What makes this film work is Jakies ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero.This movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor.#1
900_1#and not in a good way. BASEketball is a waste of film in all most every single way. It is offensive to all the senses. This doesnt necessarily bother me, Ive seen plenty of bad movies, really bad movies before and will see them again. BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it. The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a film they didnt write. Any respect I had for David Zucker has long since depleted. His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre-pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes.  Airplane  was a revolutionary and very funny comedy, watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person. And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball. My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that Parker and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script. I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable. There isnt any indication that Zucker let them improv scenes either. Parker and Stone are merely tools to a bad director. BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think Parker especially if he were allowed to take Zuckers script could have elaborated on them more. Instead we get potty humor. Dont rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around#0
11194_1#The coming attractions to  The Order  make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller, but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage. For heavens sake DONT SEE THIS MOVIE #0
9159_10#Playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor, paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers ¬ñ not to mention the numerous other actors whove besieged the castle before. Fortunately for the fantasists, this version ¬ñ with the nicely cast Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton ¬ñ stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it. Its the right length to do the story full justice, and makes considerable use of Brontes cracking dialogue; none of that modern meddling away, cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes. Not so long ago the BBC aired an excellent dramatisation of Jean Rhys enlightened and most unsettling riposte to Bronte,  Wide Sargasso Sea , imagining the back-story of the first Mrs Rochester. Do check it out ¬ñ youll never see the hero of  Jane Eyre  in quite the same way again.#1
1251_9#This documentary explores a story covered in Pilgers latest book  Freedom Next Time , which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is not easy viewing, but  Stealing a Nation  is John Pilger at his best. Recommended.#1
3758_9#This movie is awesome. If you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; however, its quantity of  dudes  and  right ons  brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago. I like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness, and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor,  Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure  (1989). If you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes, and totally mature humor, dont watch it; however, if you want a film that is humorous and silly, yet intelligent and engaging, you will enjoy it. I actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in todays theatres. And hey, its Keanu Reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as actingrightdoesnt get much better than that )#1
11651_3#Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness (81 minutes - including end credits, so roughly 76 minutes of actual film). But what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed. One thing though, the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this movie a  3  out of  10 .#0
7938_2#A family looking for some old roadside attractions to include in the fathers coffee-table book come across an ancient, decrepit old freak show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family van breaks down upon leaving the sideshow, theyre forced to stay at a nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades prior. Final verdict 2.5/10.#0
1272_7#Enjoyable movie although I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it. It is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why Elly is such a recluse. Then, when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isnt much detail. Perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something. #1
7595_1# Ask the Dust  looked intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all of the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama, and it wasnt funny enough to be a comedy. It practically seemed to satirize itself, and to no entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and I walked out, valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense. It simply was not interesting, moving, funny nor artistic. It appears as though it were written, produced and directed by a high school kid; worse yet, it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.#0
3532_1#Its like if you took the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave  im intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of  film maker rubbish, mashed in a few extra styles for good measure, chopped off the ending, there you have Revolver. Up there as the worst Movie I have ever seen, with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little.#0
1923_4#Ironic that Dr. Seuss fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed, and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The general gist of Ron Howards adaptation is that the Grinchs bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones animated version. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether its the dialogue, the pacing, or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot, the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly. There are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs theres an element or two here thats missing. Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. If you must see the feature-length version, rent it on video with Jones animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better. I give this film three cans of Who-Hash out of five.#0
6654_7#The movie took a new angle to Gandhis life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.#1
11269_8#Ever wanted to know just how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into effect? Well, unfortunately  Convention City  is lost, so well just have to watch  Tarzan and His Mate  to find out. For 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. Just look at Janes nude swim. While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. Over seventy years later, it is still as sexy as it was when it came out. In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. Ive always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s, but there are few from the genre Id call great films.  Tarzan and His Mate  is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre. The sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today. Also, the animals are all too cool (espescially the apes throwing boulders). The acting wont win any major awards soon, but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture. The film is once again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there.#1
2808_3#A cast of 1980s TV movie and TV series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley,Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others)in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models. Of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications. Over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest. This is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name of Skinamax. I really cant see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there. (I also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking, to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up)#0
479_10#Emily Watsons Natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I have ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. Or, is she transmuted to the king? The internecine weaving of the chess games and the families struggles for control, power, and victory is stunning. Just as the chess masters in the film do, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once, but all weave into either major or minor patterns. The period, the costumes, and imagery of early 20th century Italys lake district is captured magnificently. Not a single square of space is wasted. This is a magnificent movie (10/10).#1
11553_9#Theres more to offer in the opening of The Odd Couple than in the entirety of most films. Felix Unger (the poor guys monogram even curses him) checks into a New York hotel. A cleaning lady says  Good night.   Goodbye,  he answers back. In his room he empties his pockets, then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope, addressed to his wife and beloved children. When the viewer finally puts it together ¬ó aha, hes going to off himself ¬ó we watch him struggle to open the window ¬ó oh no, hes going to jump ¬ó The poor guy injures his lower back. This is all you need to know about Felix Unger ¬ó his wife has left him, hes a compulsive cleaner and hes a hypochondriac. And all in one scene. This is the particular genius of Neil Simons comedy ¬ó its about situation and character. There are few obvious physical jokes ¬ó no kicks to the groin, no cheap gags ¬ó just funny characters in uncomfortable situations. And, of course, he is a master of manipulating the audiences expectations. Coming from the Swingers era, imagine what I thought in the date scene when Felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate Oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment. Hes blowing it, right? Think again. The girls love his sensitivity, his ability to cry in front of them. They invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because Oscar wasnt paying enough attention to it. Hes in like Flynn, right? Uh, yes, but he doesnt want to go with the girls because hes feeling vulnerable. Great stuff. And its made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight-room apartment set. Youve got Jack Lemmon and the slouchy, pouchy Walter Matthau for Chrissakes, why mess it up? The visual style reminded me of Breakfast at Tiffanys, in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action. Particularly memorable is the scene in which Felix, fleeing from Oscar, closes a partition only to realize the partition doesnt cover the side where Oscar is coming from. You get a real sense of the layout of the apartment, and thus the proximity in which the two divorc√©es live. The twist here is that these two are really married ¬ó to each other. So the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys.#1
12333_9#Joan Fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself. Her husband (Richard Ney) has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance, and they are reduced to living in a tiny room, with little or no prospects. They continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong. He is a charming, feckless, but wholly amiable fellow. However, Fontaine decides he has to go, as he has outlived his usefulness. So she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her, so that she can move on. She has meanwhile had a lover (Patric Knowles) whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either. She meets the aging Herbert Marshall, who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even Fontaine could figure out how to spend. She targets him and decides he will do nicely. He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty. He certainly isnt very exciting, and has about as much sex appeal as yesterdays omelette. But Fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money, and the man standing between her and it is transparent, so that she doesnt even notice or care what he looks like, she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it. She proceeds to poison her husband, and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily, so that everything is going well. But as always happens in the movies, and sometimes even in life, some unexpected things begin to go wrong, and the tension rises appreciably, so that Fontaine begins to sweat. Fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified, and as the net begins to close in on her, her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats. Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning. But she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover, who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up. He is condemned to death for murder, because the husbands death by poison came to light unexpectedly. But Sir Cedric Hardwicke, playing a grimly determined Scotland yard inspector, thinks there may be something amiss, and begins to doubt the story and suspect Fontaine. He closes in on her, and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic. But will the innocent mans life be saved before he is executed? Will Fontaine worm her way out of this one? Will Herbert Marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation? This film is expertly directed by Sam Wood, and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which I suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir.#1
8774_8#In late 1800s San Francisco, poor well-dressed Errol Flynn (as James J.

One day, pretty Alexis Smith (as Victoria Ware) walks into the  Comstock Bank , where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so taken with Ms. Smiths elegant beauty, he offers to carry her withdrawal purse.

3974_8#The Drug Years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini-series or other kinds of TV documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on TV. Its actually not long enough, in a way. All of the major bases in the decades are covered, and theyre all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides. But it almost doesnt cover enough, or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time. For example, the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs (partly the marijuana, later cocaine) is really well presented, but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover. Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary? No, but for some summertime TV viewing for the young (i.e. my age) who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago, as well as for the old who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks, careless times, and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it. There are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased, which is not totally untrue, but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social, political, and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving (for better or obvious worse) for enough of a fascinating view.#1
3050_9#This is simply the funniest movie Ive seen in a long time. The bad acting, bad script, bad scenery, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter. So its not gonna win an Oscar but if youve got beer and friends round then you cant go wrong.#1
10314_4#As someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale, I was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been. Id like to see this movie re-made and done better, because it is a one-of-a-kind story.#0
6347_9#How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing. Now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it. This ones well on its way to being a Christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season.#1
459_10#This is the best series of its type Ive seen all year. I cant help thinking its just my luck - a series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows get never ending episodes. The theme song is a favourite, and we were disappointed to find it isnt available in any published edition. Great stuff, BBC- a triumph of sense over sex-appeal (aside from the young constable nobodys there as eye-lolly, and even if he IS, he can still act!).#1
9471_1#Dont get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, theres Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless, but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didnt click. One of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and i hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original. The book was like an Ice Cream Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust. Avoid this like a leprous prostitute.#0
5705_3# National Treasure  (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich√© that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a national treasure that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another ¬ñ attempting to create a Stanley Goodspeed regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures. The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted ¬ñ just the thick-headed.#0
202_10#A Give this Movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time-Walter Matthau & George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director Herbert Ross, and all of that makes this stage adaption come true. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70s. I love the type of humor in this film, it just makes me laugh so hard. Its very funny how that happens. Two people work together as entertainers/actors/performers. They get along well on stage, but really argue off stage, they cant survive another minute with each other, then some 15 years later, you want to reunite them for a TV special. You can find that in this film. Matthau & Burns were terrific in this film. Its a damn shame they died. George Burns deserved that Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 when this movie was filmed. So far, hes the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor. He deserved that Golden Globe. Although many people might disagree with what I am about to say, everybody in this film gave a strong performance. This Comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing Whoever hates this film is a  Putz  #1
9897_10#Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love the whole 80s genre of these kind of movies, because you dont see many like this one anymore! I want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off, or a cheesy imitation, what is it imitating? Ive never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway. ~ ~CupidGrl~ ~#1
8218_1#I never finished this movie for a reason, it was dreadful and thats just the acting. I wasnt even sure what the film was about tbh it didnt make a lot of sense and the violence was awful. I mean ususally i like some nude in a film (lol) but it was just sick because of what was happening. ALL the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities. This is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please. i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone or even consider it. (N)#0
5398_1#This self-indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on Mr. Branaghs career as an adapter of Shakespeare for the cinema. (Released 4 years ago; not a peep of an adaptation since.) I just finished watching this on cable -- holy God, its terrible. #0
2879_9#Worry not, Disney fans--this special edition DVD of the beloved Cinderella wont turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the Disney-fide adaptation of the gory Brothers Grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including  A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,   Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,  and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. The famous slipper (click for larger image) We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply wont have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking shes going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. Its a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderellas rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. Theres also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. Its a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.#1
7217_1#I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns, so my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me half way through. The saddles, costumes, accents--everything was off. The part that made me so mad is where the guy didnt shoot the  collector  with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guys soul. His only excuse was  he only had 2 arrows left.  We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else saidtoo many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. I mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, whats the point of that? And why were there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, this may be your movie. However, if you want a real Western, you will hate this movie.#0
630_2#This movie could be used in film classes in a  How Not to Script a B-Movie  course. There are inherent constrictions in a B-movie Budgets are tight, Time is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. Scarecrows script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but Ill just mention one The Gravedigger. The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. He is shown with his daughter, who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. Why give the Gravedigger a daughter? Why give the daughter a boyfriend? Why introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? Scarecrow doesnt seem to care.

1268_7#Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film. Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. I guess if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it.#1
7929_4#I guess if you are into the sci-fi and horror stuff it might be interesting. The acting was okay but not great. The two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty-one at the time. The plot is okay, but the story does jump around a bit, leaving one guessing whether youre in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use warp speed between the two. The catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith. What if the two girls had been protestant? Would the catholics of cared? Therefore some what contrived. Who knows, some day the catholic church might even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this one, dont feel youve lost anything.#0
10121_3#Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money go traveling. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). But, they remain as boring as they were before. Arguably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeares  The Tempest )  Rich and Strange  by ordering up some camera trickery. An opening homage to King Vidors  The Crowd  is the highlight. The low point may be the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat.     Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph#0
9643_2#Below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music??? Ordinary Script & Direction with full of blunders. Salman Khan was at his usual acting. Ajays performance deteriorating with time as his looks,especially his styles as a Rock Star were pathetic. Asin was just a showpiece only. Overall I felt like wasting my money in cinema. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the movie all boring except  Man Ko Ati . The Most Important Song to impress the UK Music Sponsor was most unimpressive.  Khanabadosh  can be very easily understood by an English Music Sponsor. The other movie I saw last week was  Wake Up Sid  which was simple slow love story with good direction & acting despite average music#0
11656_2#Scary Movie 2 was a grave disappointment. Simply referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter. The movie plummets from there unfortunately. The acting is awful. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. The movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) I dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers. Overall, a very poorly done movie.#0
8569_9#This is just as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more of her this time round. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the rather bumbling male lead. To use Paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea. The movie is well worth watching whatever your age, provided you like animals.#1
3379_2#I recently bought the DVD, forgetting just how much I hated the movie version of  A Chorus Line.  Every change the director Attenborough made to the story failed. The only reason I give it a 2, is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the films attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.#0
3356_10#Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched together  Ceravamo tanto amati  on a summer night we liked it, but we didnt love it as we loved  A special day . I believe Ettore Scola is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing. And so, yesterday night, my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. Theyre both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is an housewife married with a fanatic Fascist, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families. Gabriele is simply an Anti-Fascist. They spend together a special day, that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini. I dont want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film #1
11093_2#If this movie was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on  facts  that are shaded very unfairly toward Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of  racist  judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be (was arrested multiple times for beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60s and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now thats inspirational) Based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie, I would suggest passing on this one.#0
15_1#This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people..theres just no comparison. Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.#0
3000_8#Michael Curtiz directed this 1930 very-stylish whodunit from a script by Robert Presnell Sr., Robert N. Lee and Peter Mine. The original novel they adapted was  The Kennel Murder Case , perhaps from a writers standpoint the best of the Philo Vance mysteries by the strange S.S. Van Dine. Vance was a long-worded and superior detective genius, and his character being assigned to William Powell probably meant the executives at Warner Brothers were aware of the possibility that in less-engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers. Fortunately they assigned suave William Powell first to the character.; later he was played by Basil Rathbone, Warren William, and Paul Lukas before being consigned to  B  picture status.The other question as always with Warner Brothers executives is why they chose Vance as a character; their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law, with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers. This film has a despicable villain who gets murdered, and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex. The characters are unarguably unusually well-realized, the direction rather good and unusually swift-paced; and except for a darkish B/W look, the film avoids the comedic asides, superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries. Jack Okey did the good art direction. The music by Berhard Kaun is serviceable; Orry-Kelly did the costumes. William Reese provided the mostly-indoor cinematography. In the interesting cast, Powell is THE Philo Vance of his time, mostly sober-minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there. Eugene Palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to Vance, with his very professional timing. The other actor who comes off best is handsome Paul Cavangh, very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part. Mary Astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved. Also in the cast were Helen Vinson as the villains woman, Jack La Rue, Ralph Morgan (best known as Frank Morgans brother), Robert Barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill, Archer Coe, and Frank Conroy as his likable brother with Robert McWade as the D.A.; quirky and funny Etiienne Girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene. James lee as the abused Chinese servant is excellent and intelligent. The story breaks into four parts. First there is shad doings at a dog show, where Vance, Coe and Cavanagh are all showing West Highland terriers. Cavanaghs dog is killed, by Coe, to prevent him winning the title over his own entry. The second portion of the scene involves a leave-taking; someone is confused enough by who has gone where, after Coe parts from his girl friend, Vinson, to murder his nice brother by mistake. Enter Vance, to find out who did in Archer Coe in a locked room and how, with the help of Palette; the romantic difficulties are straightened out, the Chinese servant is exonerated, we find out who broke the expensive vase, who will marry whom, how Archer Coe was done in and why the butler did not do it--but someone else with a good excuse did. This is a more-than-good little mystery, which skilled Hungarian-born director Curtiz took quite seriously. He used wipes, swift cuts, changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera-work to achieve variety, interest and a sustained pace. Many writers, critics and experts, myself included, consider this to be the best of the Vance projects, although others are estimable as well.#1
8537_4#This movie got off to an interesting start. Down the road however, the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals. The male lead was very good , even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax. In comparison, this is  Boomerang  meets  Extremities .#0
12333_1#Un-bleeping-believable! Meg Ryan doesnt even look her usual pert lovable self in this, which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick. Hard to believe she was the producer on this dog. Plus Kevin Kline what kind of suicide trip has his career been on? Whoosh Banzai  Finally this was directed by the guy who did Big Chill? Must be a replay of Jonestown - hollywood style. Wooofff!#0
6126_10#I saw Jack Frost for ¬£400 at my local store and I thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was right it was good. For starters this film is about a killer snowman so thats something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the Snowman on the cover.  The acting was okay and the lines Jack Frost said had me laughing  I only axed you for a smoke  and  Worlds most pi  ed off snow cone  how funny and camp is that? The tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too  Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack gouged eyes with candle sticks . If youre looking for a for a B-Movie Comedy horror thats full of puns then check Jack Frost out. 10/10#1
7219_1#I still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in Hollywood. The acting and story is simply pathetic & the direction is awful. I dont see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do. I took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I dont know what category it falls into. Please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, even bang your head against walls but dont go for this movie.#0
6088_3#Why do I watch movies like this ? - other than I have some weird misguided masochistic belief that one day I will find a true gem amongst all this dross I cant think one one good reason. This movie was dross from start to finish - but semi-hilarious dross. Where else but in a bad Italian dubbed movie could you find heated exchanges of surreal mangled English like this one between a honest military type and the sinister chief of a secret X-files like organisation dedicated to hiding  The Truth  Favourite moment? When the Foley artists didnt notice that characters they were foleying (is there such a word?) were no longer walking on gravel but were now on the lawn so their feet kept on making loud  crunch! crunch!  noises. Other than that, another total waste of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they prove those UFOs have no bellicose motives soon#0
9053_2#Simply, I found the TV show  Mash  trite, preachy, oh ever so  politically correct , repetitious, pretentious and biggest sin of all, and that is,? that it is (was) incredibly dull. You have Alan Alda as the main lead,  (star) , who is so in love with himself and his cleverness, that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson, and Wayne Rogers, whom Ill happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found dull, also to no fault of her own wasnt a wonder to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on. Seeing one show a year showed that to me. Jamie Farr was just low brow  comedy  and is not even worth really mentioning here at all. The reason I did not give it a (one) rating, which anyone reading this by now would be wondering, is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call, but a relative one. Television, except for relatively few exceptions, is such crud. That relatively speaking, Mash had some production quality, (by television standards) of that era and today, and therefore it is deserved of a two. Rob Ritter#0
1706_3#Wow, this was a very bad movie as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, they possibly had some kind of script but its difficult to tell based on the actual end result. Unless you are (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find, do not watch this. Period.#0

9583_8#I waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when I first saw it over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write.  Now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, I lived through the so called Madonna craze. I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her  Vogue  phase and rightfully so. If not for those individuals, Madonna wouldnt have HAD a  Vogue  phase, I know that now. Credit should be given where credit is DUE. Makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream America would watch this documentary, theyll learn theyre not as  mainstream  as they think.#1
11776_4#Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past.If such a film is shown to people again,it would surely click provided if it has something new,fresh and captivating for todays challenging audiences. This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her films principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend.She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format.Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders film,it may well be Krokos involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment.It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows.#0
1759_8#Im not quite sure if the term  serious comedy  applies to this movie, Im not even sure if this can be applied. On the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin. Therefore, I considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as  serious comedies . It also includes DVD bonuses which youll really see from top to bottom.#1
2858_10#Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series). The cast had chemistry, and they seemed to genuinely like each other. That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have. It also made many of their best stories into great western drama. Overall, the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left, it slowly declined. Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too. By 1970, the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical, and it had lost a lot of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show, and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the 465 episodes that were produced, at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama! That is a pretty good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows.#1

2740_1#I still dont know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This  film  wasnt worth the Memorex DVD-R it was burned on; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents camcorder. This is by far the worst movie ever made. I truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life. This suckfest runs about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, its 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this  film  is the DVD cover, so next time youre near the Wal-Mart DVD bargain bin, take a look at it-- DONT TOUCH IT, just look-- and quietly walk away.#0
9315_7#Prominent attorney Walter Pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. Panged by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the  unknown man  who heads the syndicate, and murders him. The ironies engage when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another  unknown man  -- himself. Though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years.#1
8421_10#Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General to the Czar of Russia who has found himself there. Emil Jannings won a well-deserved Oscar, in part, for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a Russian general. The movie flashes back to his days in Russia leading up to the countrys fall to revolutionaries. William Powell makes his big screen debut as the Hollywood director who casts Jannings in his film. The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg delivers yet another classic, and one that is filled with the great elements of romance, intrigue, and tragedy.#1
12387_4#Lipstick is another glossy movie failure.I am trying to think of one good thing that I could say about the movie, and I am having trouble coming up with something.I guess the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part.The writing and the script was not the worst that I have ever encountered,but it could have been a lot better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view.The sets were very glossy and nice to look at.The cast was okay. I felt like Anne Bancrofts character was the only feasible character in the entire movie.It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this one.#0

8_4#6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting. Dont waste your time with this film, its not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens  storywise , not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). Its always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but theres too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics#0
11112_1#Wow, how bad can it get. This was seriously bad. Not in terms of the gore - which was mainly laughable CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. Overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea. What could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters at the end) is ruined in favour of look at mestyle self-conscious directing. This film wasnt made for and audience - it was made for a CV - a deeply selfish motive.#0

Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid in her investigation, seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop.

121_4#Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. Ive never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.#0
9632_8#The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual. 8/10#1

3144_10#This is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television. Season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons. The only reason that I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the finale. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to peoples imaginations, often depicting the characters in famous TV shows or movies from the 70s. It is a rare show in that i liked every character (with the exception of the final seasontoo late to try to develop a new character and fez wasnt nearly as funny). Reds foot in your ass comments never got old, nor did Kelsos stupidity. Bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long, too long even.#1
5378_3#I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they dont half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I havent even mentioned the killer, Im not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as Im concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasnt because of their acting talent, Ive certainly seen a lot worse, but Ive also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.#0
9863_10#I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a woman of 30, with no children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I have seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous, and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasionsyes,still). My favourite scene is the part where Sid says  Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!  and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the  tigers  Pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish  or however that part goes! That is THE funniest part about the whole movie, although I also really enjoyed the humour behind  putting sloths on the map  and many other parts as well. The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is  Brother Bear .#1
2782_10# Bend It Like Beckham  is a film that got very little exposure here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the U.S. Its unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here. I think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end,  Bend It Like Beckham  proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting. I was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now I regret not seeing it sooner. I highly recommend this movie #1

The Naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end. Dali and Bunuel probably loved it, and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off. 9/10#1
8430_9#Its always nice to see Angela Bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into. She is at times intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a  colored  woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers Boesman and Lenas new living area. Its not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes. Although it is based on a play, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen Cinemascope format. He also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play. Just like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have directed Angela Bassett into an Academy Award nomination. This is definitely a film worth searching for.#1
9118_10#I saw this film with a special screening of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah. It is so interesting where did this guy come from. Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world. And I am not talking about black filmmakers I am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of African themes, with his film 500 Years Later it is a African issue. But the Idea doesnt fit that mold. Showing the artistic diversity. The film is an all African cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to. I just love the mild comedy in it. And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing, it is really a art-house gem.#1
1903_10#Ok, even if you cant stand Liza- this movie is truly hilarious! The scenes with John Gielgud make up for Liza. One of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century. Dudley Moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch! The one-liners are the best.#1
6268_9#Carter Wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance! The pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going. The flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them. Although the story isnt strong, the action is fun and draws you to the very end (which I felt couldve had a sequel). Campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu #1
181_2#Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 200 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70s to early 2000s. It was  Return To Cabin By The Lake  the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it. You have been warned.#0
6009_10#Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a college radical leftist. Mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot, and he flees all the way to the desert. He does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flies it himself.  The best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography, and special visual effects. The incredible, slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion, were a stroke of genius. Although not as ground-breaking a film as Easy Rider was, Zabriski Point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture. I recommend it, for those who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval, of the youth rebellion during the early 70s.#1
9122_1#An unfunny, unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to Peter Sellers career. It is a pity this movie was ever made.#0
1018_8#The Movie was sub-par, but this Television Pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a Sci-Fi fans Ideal program. The Actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having an intelligent interesting script doesnt hurt either. Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.#1
556_1#In my book  Basic Instinct  was a perfect film. It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role. It had marvelous photography, music and the noirest noir script ever. All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get! I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made! It does damage to the original, so bad is it. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body applies to film-making, too. There should be a law Dont ever make a sequel to a perfect film #0
5709_10#Made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often. So when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost, through no fault of his own, he is frantic. Everyone is out for themselves, looking for this ticket, in something like a precursor to  The Great Race.  Even though this is all a flashback, I was in knots the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this all-for-me show-me-the-money cash-in-the-bank film. Watch Le Million today #1
360_10#11 Oscar nominations and zero win  Am yet to understand why - its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc- were all amazing - i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the Oscars that year it should go into the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges.  I own it and I watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.#1
8416_1#It makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes in Hollywood its all just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content. Yet, this film is overrated and overblown. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. No way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance so many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out. I cant even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace a nothing storyline. A bunch of songs does not a movie make.#0
8530_1# Her Cardboard Lover  is Norma Shearers last movie. She quit the movies and, I think, joined the Board of Directors at MGM. That was a good move on her part.  Her Cardboard Lover  was talky and boring in parts. It was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat.  Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the superb  Escape . The same comments about this movie can be said of another movie,  Personal Property  that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too talky, boring, and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor, so in 1937, she died at age 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.#0
5375_2#Having just watched this movie, I almost feel like having wasted 2 hours of my life, but I guess there is some good in everything As others have stated I am pretty sure the many 10s given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie. This movie could not receive a  10  judging from any remotely objective standpoint.#0
4989_3#Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you didnt like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel well, I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.#0
6653_3#I just saw this movie, and I have to say that it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) cant act at all. She read her lines very un-naturally, and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie. Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is a natural. She played her part with great perfection. This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I dont recommend it #0
6319_1#This film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if, upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in Cow Dung Collehe, the President was going to immediately change all US foreign policy. It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes#0
1712_9#This movie was disaster at Box Office, and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie, sweetness of the story. Music was good, story is very simple and old, but presentation of such story is very good, Director tried his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. Rest star cast was simply okay. Music and all songs are good, Himesh is impressive as an Singer here. Dont miss this movie, its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us. Abhay best work till date. I will give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.#1
5971_7#Skippy from Family Ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie. The film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave (using Skippy to help out). And while the plot is corny and cliche, the corniness (for example, an evil green fog taking off a girls clothes)and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious (and great). And of course, theres nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher whos asking what happened to the love song ). Definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh. And while youre at it, make it a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - theres an  evil rocker  (as stated on the video box)driller killer in black leather w/fringe. A must see for cheesy movie fans.#1
3025_1#this film is really bad. no i mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time. what appalled me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson. all in all this film is bad. thats it. 1/10.j.d Seaton#0
1343_9#Thre isnt a single Scorsese movie Id place on a list of my favorite movies. But this is the best thing Ive run through my DVD player in about five years. Scorseses patient elucidation of favorite film moments, and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent.  On a negative note, Scorsese is best when hes excited to show you some obscure movie, rather than when hes didactically teaching you something well-established about film history. And I do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose. Its very distracting.#1
6003_2#Sundown - featuring the weakest, dorkiest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unfitting, pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, whos every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest. In the end its just too silly to be funny. Sure, it has some amusing moments, but theyre few, and far apart.#0
10986_1#When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film, I was intrigued. Being a fan of the book, I assumed shed be playing Tony, Roz, or Charis, but more so, I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y, almost psychological (but not psychological thriller) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadnt read the novel, and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had. The book is a complex reflection of society, women, and modern life, and I was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film. What they actually did was a crime. Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of?#0
6065_10#This movie is horrible- in a so bad its good kind of way. Gulfax may look like sh!t, but he made this movie  The only reason Ive never seen the sequel, or even sought it out, was because of his absence! Perhaps should there be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a much-anticipated return #1
6069_8#.Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream. I love watching him interact w/ Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or whomever--he clearly was having a ball and I think he made it easier on his guests as well--so long as they Knew ahead of time it wasnt a disciplined, 19 take kind of production. Relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there. Check this out if you are a fan or curious. He was a riot.#1
11468_9#I am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the Columbine Massacre. There isnt a major documentary, very puzzling. Fortunately we are graced with the talent of Ben Coccio who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant who did the equally fine ELEPHANT. Two different takes on the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that theres something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers, and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality. ZERO DAY, purportedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event, is absolutely riveting. Even if you know where its going, you still harbor hope that it WONT  go there   and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating. The film is terrific from top to bottom, from director to script (not much improvised, though it appears very spontaneous) to the two lead actors, and the supporting players as well. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that troubled me. Okay, so we cant fathom why the shooters would do what they did, but certainly one of the contributors was their ANGER. Yet these boys dont really seem angry. They may say some things to indicate that they are, but in fact they didnt convince me that they had SOMETHING inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people. But this still leaves me with the sense of  why???  that director Coccio wants me to have. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time. The BLAIR WITCH folks could only WISH for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary.#1
5669_10#In her first nonaquatic role, Esther Williams plays a school teacher whos the victim of sexual assault. She gives a fine performance, proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool. As the detective out to solve the case, George Nader gives perhaps his finest performance. And he is so handsome it hurts! John Saxon is the student under suspicion, and although he gets impressive billing in the credits, its Edward Andrews as his overly-protective father who is the standout. Bathed in glorious Technicolor, The Unguarded Moment is irresistible hokum and at times compelling drama.#1
9571_9#I gotta be straight-up - I havent seen a film as solid as DOG BITE DOG in quite a while. Im a big fan of the  old-school  late 80s to mid 90s era CATIII films, and I had been hearing that that  style  of films is making a bit of a come-back with films such as this, and Herman Yaus GONG TAU (which as of this writing I have not yet seen), so I was very interested to give some of these newer-wave CATIII films a shot. Did this film live up to my expectations? Absolutely - but not quite in the fashion that I imagined. I could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film, but I dont want to give too much away. I watched DOG BITE DOG knowing nothing about the premise, and I think its the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way. As to comparisons to the older-style CATIII filmsthere are some similarities. DOG BITE DOG has some hyper-violent moments reminiscent of the  good ol days , but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old-school classicks like THE UNTOLD STORY or RED TO KILL. Where many of the older CATIII films main intention was to  shock  - DOG BITE DOG is a far more thought-out and well-rounded production (though thats not to take ANYTHING away from those CATIII films that I hold so dear). This film is far more  emotional  than it is exploitative, and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds, the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides. There really are no clear-cut  good  and  bad  guys, as Mad Dog shows moments of extreme compassion, and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer. Theres also no nudity/sex in this film, which is a typical characteristic of the older CATIII films. Personally, I would compare DOG BITE DOG more to Parks SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE or perhaps the Pang brothers BANGKOK DANGEROUS, as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence. Again - theres pretty much nothing that I didnt like about this film. The acting is dead-on, the cinematography is sharp and well done, and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isnt seen very often. Is this film (and others like it) the  rebirth  of the CATIII film - not exactly - but it IS a very solid film thats absolutely worth checking out9/10#1
9498_8# Painting is seeing, then remembering better than you saw.  So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter in The Light That Failed.The movie is in the grand old Hollywood style, starring Ronald Colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes Ida Lupino in her first important role, dependable character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned.),and a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston. Well acted and well directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.#1
7096_10#I had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film. At the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were  Awesome. Just awesome.  I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing so. #1
137_7#After some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie, i was doubtful of giving it a go, but i had ¬£3.99 in my wallet & thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie & saw this and gave it ago & Im glad i did, i enjoyed it. Directed by The star of films such as Chain Reaction, the Ring, Bourne Identity,(Brian Cox) i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it werent at all, i found some of the humour quite funny especially Alfred Molina the star of Spider-man 2 the Character Doc Ock. He was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film. Of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw Matthews name, and that made me get it! and no his part isnt big at all, its very short at the very end of the film, its not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film. I suggest you give it a go. Some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing, the acting, and a bit more action. But its watchable.#1
2514_8#I voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws. Other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! Its entertaining to say the least. The shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little bit too much of his  Matrix obsession  into it. It seems like their enemies just stands therewaiting to get shot at. However, this movie is touching and it always makes me cry. It has a lot of GREAT humor in it so it makes me laugh as well. Gackt is a superb actor I must say..he shows so much emotion. This was Hydes first time acting and he did okay. The role fits him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. The whole cast is what I would say, perfect for this movie. DONT MISS IT! YOULL REGRET IT #1
8670_8#WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 -- Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA  Being an on-and-off WWE fan, I have to agree that Armageddon was laced up with numerous eye-catchers throughout, and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show; the Last Ride match featured some fairly nerve-wrenching spots, and the main event also did very well for its category. All other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the Boogeyman vs. The Miz bout and the ever-useless lingerie contest. Overall Armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes this years goodbye respectably. PPV rating 8/10.#1
10087_4#This is probably the first entry in the  Lance OLeary/Nurse Keat  detective series; in subsequent OLeary films, he was played by much younger actors than Guy Kibbee. A creepy film; worth seeing #0
2524_4#Title Robot Jox (1990)  Rating 2 out of 5#0
2752_7#Though the plot elements to  The Eighth Day  seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormals first film had. Though not as good as  Toto the Hero , which will always remain on my favorites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from 2001s flavorless  The Closet  downplays his part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the characters growth. Dont walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from  Toto the Hero  because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent, if not flawed, movie#1
244_4#The silent one-panel cartoon Henry comes to Fleischer Studios, billed as  The worlds funniest human  in this dull little cartoon. Betty, long past her prime, thanks to the Production Code, is running a pet shop and leaves Henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes. A bore.#0
11426_1#Heather Graham couldnt play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do the producers of the movie think they are? the ABSOLUTE WORST, most UNREALISTIC movie ive seen in as long as i can remember. This movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign-up on IMDb and make sure the rating of this  film  drops. WHAT A JOKE! and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick, but im so sick of even thinking about it anymore. bottom line, if youre a smart person youll hate this movie, and if youre not a smart person, then youll love it its as simple as that.#0
8361_8#I had mixed feelings for  Les Valseuses  (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up liking it. I would not call it vulgar ( Dumb and Dumber  is vulgar,  The Sweetest Thing  is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially, the females would not like or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way two antiheroes treat every woman theyd meet seems unspeakable. But the more I think of it the more I realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem. I am fascinated how Blier was able to get away with it. The movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable it is well written, the acting by all is first - class, and the music is sweet and melancholic. Actually, when I think of it, two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to they prepared a woman in the train (the lovely, docile blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debuts in Ren√© Cl√©ments  Forbidden Games (1952) at age 6) for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who was finally able to get a frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) exited and satisfied; they enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early screen appearances.) Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level. In short, I am not sure Id like to meet G√©rard Depardieus Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaeres Pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but I had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring.#1
500_2#The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a laughable title, its so utterly misleading. Its not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie. I cant recommend this to anyone.#0

11905_3#With a tendency to repeat himself, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with Paris Texas. Interesting that Wenders professed that while making Paris Texas, he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, that was Wenders best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter. His films from the past 15 years+ were a total mess.#0
6360_1#May I please have my $13.00 back? I would have rather watched  Hydro- Electric Power Comes to North America . Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice, which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender. To listen to that voice again I would have to charge at least $150 an hour. And I dont take insurance. It was eerie watching Will Ferrell morph into Woody. But I dont think imaginative casting is enough. One should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie. Unless hes just doing it for the money. And if thats the case why not just reissue an All-Rap version of  Whats up Tiger Lily?  #0

10971_2#How Irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me. Overacted by the usual band of Irish actors dragged out for every Irish movie. Terrible script, with forced character quirks (the brown sauce). Romanticising all that is bad about Dublin. The attitude of ah, its a dump but sure isnt it great all the same. Plenty of tidbits purely for American audiences (the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase). And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaneys character. A great actor forced to play this part that couldve been written by a five year old. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and its a bad when you have to say that. Well, at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful American accent. International Audiences be warned stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. Youll have a better time. Intermission is a walk-outer#0
5579_2#The 60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. If done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. The acting wasnt extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960s? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to not waste your time on The 60s and do something else with your time. Im glad I watched this in class, and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylans music. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.#0
1895_10#I watched this over the Christmas period, I dont know why but it reminds me of Christmas so I watched it, so there we are.  I can watch Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film.#1
5389_7#Sort of like a very primitive episode of  General Hospital  set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so palpably a wreck, and with such good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young, as always, doesnt do anything to disinvite audience sympathy, and shes a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and lovely to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels right. Aline MacMahon,  one of the cinemas few perfect actresses,  in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, gets to croon  Frankie and Johnny  as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. Its scaled and paced modestly, and Lindens expectant-dad panic stays with you for days -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, but hes a terrified young kid in trouble, and very persuasive.#1
7615_1#me, my boyfriend, and our friend watched this  movie  if thats what u wanna call it, and we agree with the last person, but we were stupid and bought the damn thing, we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it. theses  actors  are never gonna become nothing because this movie.#0
10998_1#This movie goes beyond just being bad, it is definitively the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film, (if you can call it that).#0
3889_2#I have always wanted to see this because I love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure  The Incredible Melting Man  would be a lot of fun. I realise Im making this movie sound rather fun. It would be if it were only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the Incredible Melting Dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion. I think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it, just dont have pop-tarts during the movie, because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end.#0
7786_8#This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulees Gold). Nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Rubys day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage. #1
4469_9#Usually musicals in the 1940s were of a set formula - and if you studied films you know what Im talking about - a certain running lenghth, very  showy  performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc. Why not a 10? Near the end - at nearly 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a bit long. There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now. But overall, this ones a definite winner on every level.#1

6683_1#Im glad the folks at IMDb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into. I had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy, but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama I wasnt sure. For a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous  twist  ending, which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is. It is hard to describe just how amateurish THE HAZING really is. Did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing? Actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is.#0
4006_4#For those of you whove never heard of it (or seen it on A&E), Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about an overweight, chain-smoking, foulmouthed psychologist named Fitz who helps the Manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals. Its considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of England (and thats saying something), and was tremendously successful in England and around the world back in 1993. So, all in all, I was a little disappointed. Its recommended viewing, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. Still, if theres new series to come after this, it would all have been for the good Im convinced that McGovern can still write great stuff, and maybe now that hes got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people.#0
7320_4#A bondage, humiliation, S&M show, and not much else. The plot is flat, really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved set-pieces. The host of the aforementioned show, a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses, was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing. The dream-like ending felt tacked on. To the films credit though, Aya Sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead. Flower and Snake has been compared with Eyes Wide Shut but aside from some minor surface similarities, Kubricks is easily the more layered, artistic, and atmospheric picture.#0
4353_4#The Class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27-year-old former class mates. What bothers me with the series is that the only Latino character Aaron is being picked on for his accent (even though by a non-respectable character, but anyway).#0
3795_9#After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldnt wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the films fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of  real teen life.  Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt,  a film teens should see because its about them.  Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like  Pups  or other radical modern teen films--and McKay seemed responsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic.#1
1090_8#One of Cary Grants most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today. Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham. Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.#1
6568_4#Its curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen. Lucille Ball however was not a major star, that would come with television. As for Dick Powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like Meet The People and his career salvation would be coming in his next film. Dick Powells next film was Murder My Sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals. And Lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do.#0

10539_4#People tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror/thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer (whose name escapes me at the moment). Whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair, he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never-ending murder spree. Its not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on, by the way. Other low-budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise, like  House 3 ,  Shocker  and  Ghost in the Machine . Anyway,  The First Power  (a.k.a  Pentagram ) isnt a completely terrible effort, but the script overly reverts to clich√©s and lacks genuine thrills. The film starts off as an okay, albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop-hero Lou Diamond Philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims. He receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium, played by the gorgeous and underrated Tracy Griffith. She leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him, as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe! Thanks to Tess helpful hints, Detective Logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty, but Patrick Channing made a pact with Satan Himself and returns to the rotten streets of California to do some more killing.  The First Power  gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit. Instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world (thats what I would do in his position), Channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper. He annoyingly calls him  Buddy-Boy  all the time and possesses the bodies of Logans friends and colleagues in order to trick him. Even though never really boring or poorly realized, its a very weak film to endure, mostly because you constantly get the feeling of d√©j√†-vu. Writer/director Robert Resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful clich√© (the killer got sexually abused as a child) and even the players lines can easily be predicted. As soon as Griffith explains shes able to predict the future, you just know that, somewhere at some point in the film, shes going to say the ridiculously overused line  I tell people who to live their lives, but my own life is a mess . Yawn. Lou Diamond Philips performance is adequate enough, but its rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of  La Bamba  and  Stand And Deliver  serious as a tough copper. There also are decent supportive roles for Mykelti Williamson ( Forrest Gump ), Carmen Argenziano ( When a Stranger Calls ) and B-movie horror legend David Gale ( Re-Animator ) appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film.#0
750_8#Jodie Foster, Cherie Currie (the former lead singer of the seminal all-girl rock group the Runaways in her remarkably able acting debut), Marilyn Kagan, and Kandice Stroh are uniformly believable, splendid and touching as the titular quartet, who are a tight-knit clique of troubled, fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent, uncaring, self-absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent San Fernando Valley, California suburbs. The girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex, drugs, alcohol, commitment, and so on at a tender young age when theyre not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions. Foster, giving one of her most perceptive, affecting and underrated performances to date, is basically the groups den mother who presides over the well-being of both herself and the others; shes especially concerned about the good-hearted, but reckless and self-destructive Currie, whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end. This picture offers a poignant, insightful, often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken, dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbias neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families tough, resilient, but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent. Adrian ( Fatal Attraction,   Jacobs Ladder ) Lynes direction is both sturdy and observant while Gerald Ayres script is somewhat messy and rambling, but overall still accurate in its frank, gritty, unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kids nerve-wrackingly chaotic, capricious and unpredictable everyday life. Leon Bijous soft, dewy, almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence. Giorgio Moroder arranged the excellent score, which makes particularly effective use of Donna Summers elegiac  On the Radio.  The top-notch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Fosters neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, Scott Baio as a sweet skateboarder dude, Randy Quaid as Kagans rich older boyfriend, British 60s pop singer Adam Faith as Fosters feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and Lois Smith as Kagans smothering, overprotective mother. Appearing in brief bits are Robert Romanus (Mike Damone  Fast Times at Richmont High ) as one of Fosters morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky, braces-wearing Laura Dern as an obnoxious party crasher. Achingly authentic, engrossing and deeply moving (Curries grim ultimate fate is very heart-breaking),  Foxes  is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movies made about early 80s adolescence.#1
2590_4#American Pie has gone a long distance from the first. At first i believe the actors dont have a clue what their doing and instead its just a remake of a college party gone nuts. Story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie. In fact they didnt once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film. Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free. But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking. Im a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty wouldve been a better choice instead.#0
3937_3#Its hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being at the top of the glory. Nine years later he is almost forgotten, and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably. I cannot even explain why, he is a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from. There is not too much to be told about this film. Its the only big screen film of Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. All is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex-doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob. The off-screen voice is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film. You probably will not meet the film but in DVD rental stores, or on TV. Try to look for something better.#0
12257_3# Its not like that big mechanical toy , says a character early on, commenting on  Jaws . Well,  Blood Surf  would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the  Jaws  series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Acting and directing are not much better, either; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than to a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but for the audience too. Saying you  liked  this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap, further destroying the poor horror genre. ( 1/2)#0
5761_4#Hollywood does it again. Lots of money, no creativity. Im sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one. Based on the previews, I thought that this would be a funny movie. But if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then youll miss most of the silly humor in this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide. #0
8506_8#. . .but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy. Id really like to own the movie since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and at the time I saw this movie, I was driving that model bus. It was only (during his murder trial some 15 years later) that I remember vaguely that OJ was one of the stars in it. I only recall that he was the driver and of the bus being shot up and driven wildly. Ive been looking all over for this movie to no avail, since viewing it in the mid-80s. I liked the movie, I dont usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide, and viewing its beginning (although fuzzy) I stayed for the whole thing.#1
1392_7#Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the Williams family, living in the California desert.

2725_8# In Cold Blood , adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capotes famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger-man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesnt glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.#1
434_8#Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male, Im probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own  thing  that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didnt try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen. Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people.#1
12375_7#This horror movie, based on the novel of the same name, suffers from flawed production and choppy, amateurish direction, but its nonetheless strangely compelling. Unlike shocker horror flicks such as The Exorcist, this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless dip into a pool of evil. It drifts into horror, which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl whos been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel. Her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world. This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life. The horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly, such as when Alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores. She relives her first suicide attempt, faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians, and sees a cat cut up as a cake. Time and again, shes yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy, through dreams and waking nightmares, all the while lacking the means to cope. In truth, the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel. Will he succeed? In summary, slow-moving yet indescribably creepy, well-acted but poorly directed, and a very typical 70s horror film before the real shockers cut loose. (No pun intended) This movie may not work for those with a short attention span, but it can still send chills up the spine, and still can provide some low-key shock value. It remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil.#1

5801_1#Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. He travels to this small town where its said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. I really hate Christian films. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid storyline and minimal effects. Not to mention that this isnt just a Christian filmbut a foreign one as well. The voice-over actor for Ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing, because it is so high pitched and whiny. You wont miss much by missing out on this film.#0
8194_9#Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the countrys socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early 80s. Its also a kickass action movie. Opening with a liberal, female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene which prompts the famous,  Go ahead, make my day  line),  Sudden Impact  is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film. The first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome Inspector Callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. It gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for Callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the 80s.#1
7669_8#Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why Id have loved to see follow-up movies but judging by the rest of Full Moons output there simply werent enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasnt sure if Ms. Nipar hadnt wandered off an A-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. No, seriously! Anyway - its a shame they didnt have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.#1
7809_1#Definitely an odd debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preachers home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything all better. Ahhif only everything in life were that easy. The fact that this  film  looks as if it was made with about $500 certainly doesnt help. 1/10#0

9572_8#Those individuals familiar with Asian cinema, as a whole, are aware that Japan is renowned, or notorious, for its hyper-violent films and Korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films. Dog Bites Dog, while not necessarily getting as hyper-violent as the craziest Miike film, nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some Koreas more ambitious efforts, it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all its own. The greatest strength this film has though, like the greatest of the Japanese or Korean efforts, is that the brutality, rather than detracting from the film, actually develops the characters, if not, pushing the story forward. The two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such. Sam Lees character, for instance, is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely, amidst various encounters with Changs character, it is revealed why he is. Without spoiling this part of the story too much, it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father. Changs character, on the other hand, has his most primal instincts honed to, if not perfection, brutal efficiency. Surprisingly, Changs story arch, while not necessarily revealing a more human side, actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal (and no I am not talking about Sam Lee, rather Pei Peis garbage dump girl character). Ultimately however, for the first 80 minutes or so, it is a, more or less, straight forward cat and mouse, or Dog chase Dog, film in which every encounter ends in at least one death (seriously, once Sam Lee and Chang Square off, some one will die) and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act. Which brings us to the films one weakness. Unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but, to put it simply, it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since, rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film, the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it. Dont get me wrong, if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasnt filled with sweet music (in fact if it, like the majority of the film, kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job), it still could have worked and not detract from the film. As it is though, despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters, the way it was handled made it feel tacked on, and almost, insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across. Nevertheless, it is still a breath of fresh air from Hong Kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact.#1
1133_4#I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one. A lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre. Usually this is okay because were dealing with a genre, but the challenge generally resides in making it original, new and inventive. This movie fails to do so. Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But its a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteurs.#0

2779_7#To  Bend It Like Beckham  may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to  Hit it Like Bonds  or  Dunk it Like Jordan.  Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player David Beckham does, much like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), does in the film Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. After satisfying the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules mother thinks shes a lesbian. The movie does resort to a bit of a clich√© moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess sisters wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boys world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.#1
8737_9#Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed Bugs Life a bit more. I cant remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and doesnt preach. The voice overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox#1
2164_2#I thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including Peter OToole, Susannah York, Michael Craig & Harry Andrews might be worth watching. Alas, I was wrong. Utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both OToole and York overacting wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. Ive a feeling OToole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (York). He is also barking mad. But apart from that, your guess is as good as mine. The film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. I can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. Risible.#0
11698_3#This move reminded my of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. It has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve. I think thats always the them in a Crypt story. The same goes for the bad acting. Very bad acting. I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didnt like it and I wasnt expecting much. Whenever I watch a stephen King movie I dont expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels. I have read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such. It was so good. But I noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies. The endings were very different then the movie versions. I assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy. I ending of Thinner is the worst. So Cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the real ending. I suggest everyone who intends to read stephen Kings novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare. And that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book. I intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies. Im sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong.#0
7178_1#Overrated and only for those people in their 20s whom wear particularly thick rose tinted glasses, who never actually saw it in the first place because they were to young. Awful animation, dialogue and a tired narrative. A real product of the 80s, the novel gimmick of a puzzle TOY (thats right, TOY not the absurd, pretentious and child alienating  collectors action figurine ), sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other paraphernalia, only matters to those who bought the TOY when they were  actual  children in the period of 84 to 87.

841_1#I just watched this film 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just watched. Mainly I think its a film about an internet S&M  star  of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online. Shes murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death. The local homicide division of Big City, USA is also investigating, though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic  as the real thing . I know. Wow. All in all, stay away from this film. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. Like, playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.#0

11481_1#If they could get Ed Asner why didnt they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger. It forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability. I guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work. If the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long-distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better. He has good reason to be jealous, good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective, controlling manipulative father.

3755_10#I remember this film from many years ago. Certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. The fact that I vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact.  I wish it would be shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it??#1
2683_3#Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail?If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. Contrived plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound. This slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line-the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out. (This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint). Later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and Bangkok is a big city, mind you, Ive been there- and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison. Cmon. Rent Another Day in Paradise instead.#0
7607_8#Its not well shot, well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show Ive seen since Twin Peaks. Every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. They have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like theyve just told you everything you wanted to know. However some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal. Some characters are very two dimensional. The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out over actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to. Annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing. However, the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously. All in all its a great show but not perfect.#1
4247_10#THE GIRL FROM MISSOURI arrives in New York City knowing exactly what she wants to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon, but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love? It should be noted that this film was produced soon after Hollywoods Production Code was instituted. A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which Harlows character goes after the same ends, but uses very different means.#1
362_3#Not to be confused with the Madonna film  The Next Best Thing ,  The Last Big Thing  is a silly, campy, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called  The Next Big Thing  which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. This low budget indie makes  Chuck and Buck  look like a masterpiece. Fraught with lousy acting, poor sets and costuming, etc.,  Thing  has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award. Pass on this one.#0
9956_9#Beforehand Notification Im sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here, but when I saw the preview for this movie, I was thinking  Finally!  I have yet to see one movie about popular African-influenced dance (be it popular hip hop moves, breaking, or stepping) where the main character was a Black woman. Ive seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-Black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it (Breakin, Breakin 2, Save the Last Dance, Step Up), but the Black women in the film are almost nonexistent. That always bothered me considering so much of hip hop, African-influenced dance, and breaking was with Blacks and Latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasnt always men who performed it, so I felt this movie has been a long time coming. However, the race does not make the film, so I also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watch. I wouldve given this movie five stars, but the music playing killed it for me. I definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs.#1
3075_1#Yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I have definately seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! It was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something (if you want to see crap, you should have of seen what some friends and I brought in). All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think was meant to bad like Mars Attacks. So I guess Im standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.#0
6031_3#Its been a while since seeing this the first time, so I watched it again with the second movie in the series.

9715_4#This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pinos hot-headed character would have been transferred to the  rubber gun squad  years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character theyve ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a  race traitor  who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites. Whats more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they wont serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DAs careers.#0
5418_10#Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in 19th Century India who, with the help of a water boy (Sam Jaffe) rid the area of the murderous thuggee cult. The chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Loosely based on Rudyard Kiplings poem. A must see by anyone who enjoys this type of movie.#1
11489_10#If youre looking for a Hollywood action packed kid-flick with the common bad language and violence this may not be the film to sit down for. If youre on the other hand interested in watching a film with youre children that has actually some values like showing the importance of friendship and truth this is the film to watch. Looking at the program guide this is obviously what millions of other viewers have found. Not many low-budget independent films have ever been aired as much as Mr. Atlas. The film is actually very funny as well as warm hearted and shows some beautiful locations masterfully captured by the sharp eye of the obvious brilliant cinematographer Suki Medencevic. Also if youre interested in looking at a muscular fellow with good looks the ladies can get an eye full. Lets support those who make good childrens film buy buying their videos and watching their products on TV. Enjoy#1
4433_7#The story On the island Texel, photographer Bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and lust for life intrigues Bob, who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. Her life is not so simple as it seems, however. Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to win his trust? Review The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the characters psychology would have been worked out a little more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? This is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view. The story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify that. So you dont get to know the characters on that deeper level. The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and believable way, but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this characters naiveness doesnt quite work for a grown-up woman. Camera-work is nice, and there are some great shots of the nature on the island. I give the movie a 7/10.#1
3018_10#This movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is worser than the original. Its comedy at its best. This movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second. At more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a joke. G√∂ta kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production TV series such as survivor (expediton Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish movie for the Swedish audience. Thus dont see it if you arent familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise Have fun! Johan#1
12412_9#What we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise, a cast that is filled with familiar faces AND one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films. Socould anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated???  Prison  is the Finnish director Harlins American debut, which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like  Die Hard 2 ,  Cliffhanger  and  Deep Blue Sea . The story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle Wyoming prison, re-opened for the cause of over-population in other, more modern state penitentiaries. Inside the former execution dungeons, the restless spirit of the electric chairs last victim still dwells around. The now promoted warden Eaton Sharpe (Lane Smith) was there already 40 years ago, when this innocent man was put to death, and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial. It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived. Viggo Mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and Chelsea Field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past.  Prison  contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but its the unbearably tense atmosphere thatll stick to you for certain! Unlike any other horror picture from that decade,  Prison  features an amazing sense of realism! By this, I refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls, of course, and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed even though these are genuinely unsettling as well. The films best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror. The absolute best terror-moment (providing me with nightmares ever since I saw it at rather young age) focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire. Haunting  The screenplay only suffers one flaw, but thats a common onealmost inevitable, I guess clich√©s! The story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding. Weve got the ugly, fat pervert with his cute boy-toy, the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and ¬ñ naturally ¬ñ the old n wise black con who serves a lifetime (did I hear anybody yell the name Morgan Freeman?) Dont stare yourself blind on these clich√©s is my advise, as there are so many other elements to admire. The photography is dark and moist, the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class B-actors are excellent (the fans will recognize Tom Everett, Tom Tiny Lister and even immortal horror icon Kane Hodder). Forget about Wes Cravens god-awful attempt  Shocker  or the downright pathetic cheese-flick  the Chair . This is the only prison chiller worth tracking down! Especially considering Viggo Mortensen peaking popularity nowadays (I heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves, Hobbits and other fairy creatures) this true 80s horror gem oughts to get an urgent DVD-release #1
377_1#Dont even ask me why I watched this! The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. ) Its too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the Bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy, gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film. The script is dismal, peppered with clich√©d lines,  Are you ready, Pardner?  purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims. Dire. Avoid.#0
3162_8#Over the years, weve seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what, keeping  8 Simple Rules  going after John Ritter died comes to mind, but this is probably the first time I cared. The idea of having  That 70s Show  without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous. They tried to cover it up with a comeback of Leo and increasingly outrageous story lines, but it always felt like why bother when you dont have a main character anymore. It just didnt really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasnt even funny. The last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now wed be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were. Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working, because the whole deal was that hed say something weird from out of nowhere, and you cant say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours. They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasnt a kid. Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door, you started praying it wasnt Randy, please let it not be Randy. The deal with Randy was that hed do really awful jokes, usually as Red would say, smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches. I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused. The problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasnt about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera. Everybody started being in love with everybody, emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea, with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching  As The World Turns . Im guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from  Family Matters . To be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either. By the way, yet more criticism on Season 8 what the hell was with the opening theme? Not only did they use the same joke twice (a character not singing), Fez scared the hell out of me. Dude, dont open your eyes that far. But the first five seasons or so,among the best comedy ever broadcast.#1
1334_4#So I finally saw the film  My Left Foot  last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is The central performance of Day-Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less.

425_10#I would like to comment on the movie April Love. Its one of my all time favorites because my father, Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and lo and behold he came home w/the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park. Its very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w/all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus#1
5497_9#A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself (for further evidence, check out some of the comments on IMDb!). Compares extremely favourably with Oliver Stones  Comandante  (which is mainly an in-depth examination of Fidel Castros nostril hairs). I dont know whether Chavez is everything he presents himself as being, or yet another in the long line of populist Latin-American  caudillos . Nor do I know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of Venezuelans. Its hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but Ive certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of whats at stake, and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the film  were making history , and thats exactly what the film feels like its capturing. Outstanding stuff.#1
2256_8#Did not know what to expect from from Van Dammes partner & friend /trainer/and his fight choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him act as  TONG PO  in  Kickboxer and other Van Dammes films. Now hes on his own. He and his wife make a great team. In this one Qissi is the action director and lead bad guy and hes good. Really meanacing. His wife was the writer, producer and directed most of the scenes which didnt require action. She also did good job editing the film. Together they did a great job. The story made sense, the fight scenes were edited well, the leads were real fighters and looked good together - the story came together well, and if you can beleive itno bad language, no sex, just action. A new one on me. Check it out #1
9874_8#In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin. This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supporting Oscar win the year before in  Johnny Eager.  The singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left a lot to be desired. It was a Gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer.#1
12070_2#I happen to have bought one of those  Legacy of Horror  50 movie pack collections and would you believe Im still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it. Sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like The Devils Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of the great Alfred Hitchcocks films (some arent horror however and are only on there because Hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense) but other times it seems that they put movies like The Island Monster and this on because they cant accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter. So we open up to sort of a Westing game idea. The rich yet cruel and abusive father played by Carradine (the one standing feature of this) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates. Carradine gives a good enough performance as always, but hes left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre/terrible performances. The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes. Given this was an independent film of the 70s the lighting and effects are pretty limited. Its hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer cant see whats happening that well in some scenes. Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga give an effort at least and Im ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who-done-it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film. You arent meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable. The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there. It proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack  Chilling  containing films like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of horrors with Jack Nicholson, and Night of the Living Dead over it. This is best avoided.#0
10238_10#People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this movie is no exception. Some movies I love did poorly at the box office but, Im glad to say, this movie isnt one of them (over nine million dollars, which I dont think was bad for back then). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated movie. I didnt think Professor Screw Eyes or his  Scary Cirus  was too scary for little kids (the targeted audience for this movie), but I thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years.#1
696_10#Surprisingly well done for an independent film, An Insomniacs Nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully well written, and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniac. With twists and turns around every corner, An Insomniacs Nightmare is provocative and engaging. It comes very highly recommended.#1
6136_2#Bucks role as The Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker (of The Price is right) running a country the same way he runs his show. But theres lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey. Kurt Thomas as the baby-faced  hero  displays some considerable acrobatic skills, but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever. Theres a few spooky moments (in the Village of Crazies, mostly), and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences. But any given  Ninja  movie will give you much more entertainment, and you wont feel as guilty about laughing.#0
5479_3#Ill bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary scouting expedition to Mexico before taking on the Aztecs. Good thing he did because he would never have known about those T Rexs that inhabited one particular valley where the locals revered them as gods. If youre interested in finding out about this reconnoitering expedition that didnt quite make the history books by all means check out Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try and sit through it with a straight face.#0

12346_10#This is a very fine and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Magnificent music score. Ive been twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The movement of the camera is superb, as well as the actors. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and its all very well brought onto the screen here. The director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. Once youve seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director. Its a real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everybody.#1

7526_8#Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With  The Notorious Bettie Page  she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America, an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner, are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Betties life were all the film was concerned about, then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in Americas attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, she accomplishes this goal admirably, holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own  enlightened  21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism, this is a film needed more than ever.#1

2220_9#We tend to forget that the master/slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well-tended estates, powered by large groups of enslaved people, and a lot of money for the white owners. It lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves. I know it may sound callous, but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me, despite the sour taste I found in my mouth at what went on, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Watch it. If not read up on the period, because theres a lesson to be learned from it all.#1
2615_2#I dont know why, but for some sick reason, I think since Ive been on the Disney sequel binge, I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first movie that was a remake of the Disney cartoon classic starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, it seemed like a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these movies dont work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults. This was not really that fun because its adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings, I understand theyre trying to make sure that its appealing to the kids, but its ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film. And 102 Dalmationss story isnt really that good. 2/10#0
12134_8#I happen to like Leslie Howard, in his better films. Yet, for some reason, his performance in OF HUMAN BONDAGE never has moved me tremendously. I first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s Howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by Dirk Bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed. This is not usually the case (off hand I think of Ashley Wilkes as a man who might be betrayed, if he and Scarlett OHara were meant to be an item by Margaret Mitchell - but Ashley loved Melonie, not Scarlett). Howard could play any type, and a role like R. J. Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins is not one who is betrayed.  Curiously her performance was not all of one note. While she uses and abuses Howard for two thirds of the film, culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her, her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating, and her inability to keep any honest jobs. When Howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes (he asks what happened to her baby - she tells him the baby died and Howard says brusquely that he is glad, which is hardly the response she expects). In the end Howard does finally get his life in order, but Mildred ends a casualty (ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend Denny on a medical call). The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences did fail to nominate Davis in 1934 (leading to the largest write - in campaign in its history, and a permanent change in its rules), but Davis was established as a star. In one year she won the Oscar as Joyce Heth in DANGEROUS. And in two years she co-starred with Howard again (as equal stars) in THE PETRIFIED FORREST.#1
6255_1#This is the only movie that my wife and I have ever walked out on. Totally sucked. We saw it in Omaha even. Not funny at all, looks like a 14 year old kid wrote the humor. I cant believe these real politicians were actually in the movie. awful.#0
8812_3#Unfortunately, the realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes. Wheres Blade when you need him? While as dismal as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as nightmarish as BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES isnt nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies. While the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe Jeffery Dalmers hearts race a little faster, it wasnt nearly as interesting as RAVENOUS. Really, I found it about as interesting as late-night infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you might be able to endure this, otherwise, for no one. I was really surprised that this one wasnt made by the people at Brain Damage as that was the quality of Dead Creatures.#0
9070_7#It started out slow after an excellent animated intro, as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop. Once the bet is on, though, the movie picks up the pace as its a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son bullies, helping others, mind over matter when you dont want to do something. One other good aspect of the movie was the respect/fear engendered by the principal Mr. Burdock (Boilerplate). Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons. While he has one particular goofy scene, he ruled the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin getting some work.#1
10285_10#David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `House of Games, a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel, Driven. Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; theres an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability. When a patient, Billy Hahn (Steven Goldstein), confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that theyre going to kill him if he doesnt pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf. This takes her to the `House of Games, a seedy little dive where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna), a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. Instead of the `twenty-five large that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if shell agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the `tell of one of the other players. By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. The dialogue, and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing. As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her. From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a `tell is and how it works, to the lessons of the `short con, to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. And nothing is what it seems. In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself. She changes; and whether or not its for the better is open to speculation. Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does. Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, self-assured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well. The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum (Joey), Lilia Skala (Dr. Littauer), J.T. Walsh (The Businessman), Ricky Jay (George) and William H. Macy (Sergeant Moran). `House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; hes written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. Youll find it under `Perfection. This is one great movie you do not want to miss. I rate this one 10/10.#1
321_1#Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with. I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didnt even have the guts to call it by its full name The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how low he can go.#0
3706_7#The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street-smart, intelligent, world-weary character. She doesnt have a huge role but she does a great job portraying Lois Harlan as a woman tired of, although used to, covering up for her boss indiscretions.#1
871_9#Sur mes l√®vres or READ MY LIPS is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of outsiders, people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to fit in. Director Jacques Audiard with and co-writer Tonino Benacquista have created a tense, tight, completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights. Devos and Cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong. Once again Alexandre Desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the Hitchcockian sense of suspense. Director Audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story he shows us the difference between hearing the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments. This is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the French film noir genre. Recommended. Grady Harp#1
987_4#You know all those letters to  Father Christmas  and  Jesus  that are sent every year? Well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. As bizarre settings go, its a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is  Dead Letter Office . Having said that, this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one. If it was Royal Mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. I havent been in this flat for two years and were still getting letters for a Mr Wang, some female priest of the Church of Latter Day Ive-Never-Heard-Of-You and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company. Despite that,  Dead Letter Office  is certainly something a little different. It might not be to everyones taste but I liked it. Yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, its nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity (no chance of that in an Australian film). There aint any major laughs, theres no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one-dimensional. But its the story that counts here and while its not earth-shattering in its magnificence, its a pleasant enough way of passing the time. Its the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldnt really miss it if it wasnt there.#0
12285_10#Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). The film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.#1
12029_4#Generally, Ive found that if you dont hear about a movie prior to seeing it on DVD, theres probably a good reason for it. I hadnt heard about this movie at all until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. Since all the good movies had already been rented out (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I figured Id give this one a shot. Admittedly, there were some very funny moments in the film, but I didnt think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall.#0
4102_10#I like this movie much, its special type of humor by Ondricek and Machacek I think its better then Samotari (Loners).. Maybe its difficult to understand when you are not Czech. If you are not watching that movie, just enjoy it, dont mind about anything else.. just relax  #1
7686_10#After enjoying this show for years, I use to dream of being able to see them all again and share them with my grandchildren. I am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that I have found recorded on DVD. Florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband, one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night. Michael, the baby son is a freedom walker and JJ is a clown. I know many Afro-Americans disliked this show, but I know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was. My heart was sad when I learned that Ester Rolle had passed. Tyler Perry is now the leading writer actor of today and I support his work, but not as much since he made such cruel mocking of Rolle in one of his plays. No one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance. The show started getting less interesting when Daddy James died. It picked up a bit when Florida remarried, but slumped when she took an absence from the show. In all, the show was great and again I am pleased to own copies of part of my past. I do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of Good Times, and I must say, they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumors. I think children of today will enjoy this show and I have no problem sitting and watching with children. Congrats to the writer, crew, and stars for years of renewed memories of a time that I can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes. OK so I watch the shows over and over. Lately I have noticed thing that has made me rethink the series, but not dislike them. I think Florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made. Not that the children did not need supervision, but it was done in a way that makes Floridas mothering different. The scenes where Florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now. When James was alive, the show made a big thing out of James wanting his own Fix-it shop, but never lived to see his family out of the projects, but Florida marries someone who owns a fix-it shop. A bit of a slap in the face to an actor who should have ended his time on Good Times showing that he accomplished all he strove for. Lastly, As I watch the shows, I see the series going in to overtime and being renamed  JJ . To be truthful, after James left everything mostly centered around JJ. Not a bad thing, just a noticeable thing. I would not trade my DVDs for any amount of money, but time, maturity and experience began to guide your eyes after a while.#1
6429_7#If the movies are to be believed, Chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their Western counterparts. The storylines of the three Chinese Ghost films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that its not a huge problem. As always, humour is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of mugging. For those who havent encountered the Chinese GhostStory trilogy yet, this film offers an interesting departure from the Western horror/ghost genre; for those who have, another enjoyable romp in the Chinese ghost world.#1
6341_7#Although I really enjoyed Jim Carreys latest  serious  performances ( The Truman Show ,  Man on the Moon ), Ive always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic, talented actor those bozos at the Academy Awards seem to dislike him so much, he has never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. Well, any  institution  that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as  Titanic  shouldnt be taken seriously. That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being that is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoon-like, so unreal, that never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the Christmas. I loved this film to bits, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now. As timeless as they come.#1
10044_9#Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game. If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes. #1
8923_8#The Blob is a classic 1950s B-movie sci-fi flick. You probably know the story two teens (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they run into an old man with some weirdblob attached to his arm. They take him to the doctors office, and then go to find out what happened. From there, the blob spreads, eating everyone in its path. The special effects are cheesy fun, as is the story. There are a lot of great touches, like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district. Its no masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.#1
6444_4#Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. Steven Greenstreets documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members. Naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints, but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals.#0
2028_10#Burlinson and Thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie, along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love, it really goes down deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this movie, placing among one of the best I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic  Any horse-lovers out there will love this movie! #1
5002_8#I was privileged to have seen some snippets from Aardmans original run of this show in the UK. It was always fun and always funny. None of the charm has been lost in translation--its as fresh as the people interviewed--whether some of it is scripted or not, as has been rumored, is beside the point. Its always entertaining. Aardman Animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the single aspect that I probably love most about the show and its concept (the hostility between the pandas, the porcupines discussing fear of needles, the painting ape). Regulars really grow on you as well, such as the horse and donkey teens from Maryland, most every married couple (the parrots, the insects, and the cats to name a few) and child-voiced character, and Ive really come to dig the ferret! Mondays finally become a day to which to look forward.#1
9920_7#This is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a Canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man. It begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things, parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it isnt really made very clear. The emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how theyre herded around outside in little yellow jackets. The film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory, and talking with his crew as he does so. This is a world of relentless industrialization. Its a relief at least to know these soulless images arent going to be presented without a human voice, as is the case in Nikolaus Geyrhalters gleefully cold documentary about the food industry, Our Daily Bread. Manufactured Landscapes contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town (many towns, really) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever, with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is. Some of these scenes, the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places, might have been shot memorably by the premier engag√© photographer Sebasti√£o Salgado. But this photographer isnt as interested in seeing people up close. His orientation places him somewhere in between Salgado and the cold, neutral modern landscape photographs of Lewis Baltz. Because of the limitations of the narration, the idea of the title Manufactured Landscapes feels insufficiently developed. It even seems a misnomer. New landscapes they are, but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than  manufactured.  Landscapes of Waste or Wasted Landscapes might be better titles. There is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about Edward Burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions.#1
1200_10#Have no illusions, this IS a morality story. Granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter, tempted back to the plains one more time by kill-crazed Taylor. Granger can see the end is near, and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt-on the herds, the Indians and the land itself. Taylor, on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo, or Indians to being with a woman. While Grangers role of the tortured hunter is superb, its Taylor who steals the show, as the demented, immoral everyman out for the fast buck and the goodtimes. Theres not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story moves along quickly, and we are treated to a fine character performance by Nolan. The theme of this story is just as poignant today, as in the 1800s-mans relationship to the land and whats on it, and racism. Considering when this was made, the Censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the bawdy house, Taylors relationship with the squaw, and much of the dialogue. Although downbeat, this is truly a great western picture.#1
7046_2#I saw this dull waste of time on HBOs Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue Ive come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but thats about it. This is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around.#0
9214_3#Many things become clear when watching this film 1) the acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict borders soap opera-ish. The other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical Im-a-babe-but-Im-really-sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbies dreams and episodes are disturbing (acted by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice ( we are all special friends ); 5) the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting; and 5) this is a really bad movie. Expect to be disappointed--and probably disturbed.#0
8419_9#The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg.It shows us Czarist General, Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his days of glory.In 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he has nothing.He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent).About ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution.His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not.The Last Command is very good silent drama.Emil Jannings does memorable role work in the lead.Evelyn Brent is wonderful playing the woman lead.William Powell is great as always.There are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie.Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent.And then there is the ending with Powell and Jannings.This is a movie that touches in many parts.#1
315_10#I absolutely LOVED this Soap. It has been one of my favorite. Will highly recommend ) I just love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. Im really sad that the soap ended but Im sure Ill be able to find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see it. I loved the characters, the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains. The only thing I would have changed is the end for Xica and her long life love. I cant wait to see it again and highly recommend it. Xica has been by far, the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else )GO XICA.. Hope you all like it as well.#1
